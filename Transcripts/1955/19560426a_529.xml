            <text syncTime="17.669" offset="70635">Mr. George G. De Sylva was a composer and author of songs.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.824" offset="91220">In his earlier years, some of his compositions became very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.931" offset="115670">Some of those were renewed during his lifetime and some of his songs were not renewed within the statute, Section 24 of Title 17 of the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.597" offset="166348">And it is those compositions which were not renewed during the lifetime of the decedent which concern us in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.335" offset="209293">The questions presented here are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.183" offset="220682">First, does the surviving spouse, in this case the widow, take those renewed copyrights granted by Congress to certain dependents of the deceased author?</text>
            <text syncTime="71.433" offset="285675">Does the widow take those renewals to the exclusion of the child or children?</text>
            <text syncTime="77.678" offset="310648">And secondly, is an acknowledged illegitimate child, a child within the meaning of Section 24 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.737" offset="362893">I believe it would be appropriate to say and the record reveals that the child here was not just an illegitimate child out of the blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.936" offset="399673">This child enjoyed the company and society and the love of his father, and in respect to the law of California, is an acknowledged child, formally fully acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.603" offset="478354">The issue as to whether or not this child was fully legitimated, was one that was not admitted, and for that reason that issue was not decided in the trial court because the court felt that under the facts of the case which were admitted and stipulated in most instances that the child was a child within the meaning of Section 24 of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.658" offset="1210619">Here, the federal statute will give certain rights to children, now, I do not think it is universally true that children in any statute include illegitimate as well as legitimate children.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.596" offset="1438302">I should like first to call the Court's attention to the fact that -- excuse me -- we are concern here only with the renewal clause of the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.724" offset="1490860">In other words, the copyright under our present laws granted for 28 years with the right given to certain classes of persons to obtain that renewal for an additional 28 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.123" offset="1540389">And that our matter here involves only the renewal provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.450" offset="1565780">We note first of all that the renewal provisions of the Act contemplates dependents of the author, and that the Act, the Renewal Act, was adapted for the purpose of protecting dependents of an author.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.387" offset="1633489">And we suggest without painstaking the child regardless of the legal status of its parents is a dependent of the author.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.322" offset="1673195">Now, this matter has been before the courts on numerous occasions not in the precise or problem presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.462" offset="1717812">But the courts have consistently held that the purpose of the Renewal Act is to protect the widows and the children of the deceased author from the supposed improvidence of authors.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.815" offset="1787193">The -- there is no other reason for having a split term of copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.143" offset="1820526">Congress had before it, rather the copyright law, contentions were made that there should be one long term of copyright protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.684" offset="1866710">The Congress consistently since the very -- the first enactment in 1790, the copyright laws provided in this country a split term and the reason for the split term or second term of copyright is to give a new, a fresh and unfettered right directly to those persons whom Congress designates as the dependents of the author.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.890" offset="1979559">We must assume that Congress recognized that it would be shocking to have the -- those dependents of one who has contributed great good suffer from lack of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.420" offset="2037656">As we have enunciated in the cases that the second provision of the second copyright is clearly intended to protect the widow and children, and the debates in Congress indicate clearly that that was the purpose for the renewal portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.966" offset="2127830">And we suggest that there was not much reason for a split term of copyright except that the second term given fresh, given new directly to these persons designated by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.322" offset="2181224">That gives them a new and unfettered right and claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.528" offset="2198047">And we therefore submit that the Copyright Act itself is the strongest and most persuasive argument that the concept of nullius filius, as known in the ancient law, does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.221" offset="2276833">It is true that in the early stages of the common law, there was a concept of nullius filius which arose, I believe, as a matter of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.066" offset="2328242">It's easy to prove the marriage, church records and no other evidence was submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.614" offset="2354364">However, this doctrine has been considerably changed and transplanted and all of the cases, I believe, without any specific exception, have applied that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.125" offset="2420402">There are exceptions which I believe have been -- have been from time to time of old rule which have applied that doctrine only to matters of inheritance and to no other matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.005" offset="2472020">We note that the -- renewal portion of the Copyright Act is not a hereditament.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.021" offset="2496052">The new right goes directly not through any estate to the widow and the children.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.936" offset="6723709">In the case of Middleton versus Luckenbach, 226 F.2d, the question arose out of the Federal Death Act which, I believe, is analogous to our case where several people were -- lost their lives on the high seas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.227" offset="6852859">Under that federal death statute, the Court stated and I quote, “There is no right of inheritance involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.502" offset="6893923">It is a statute that confers recovery upon dependents, not for the benefit of an estate, but for those who, by our standards, are legally or morally entitled to support."</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.206" offset="7036761">The Court there goes on to say, “The purpose and object of the statute is to continue the support of dependents after a casualty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.000" offset="7071974">To hold that these children or the parents do not come within the terms of the Act would be to defeat the purpose of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.937" offset="7335706">But the case of Green V. Burch, a California case, the Court there stated that the doctrine nullius filius is no longer suitable to the needs of the people and it cannot be regarded as part of the law today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.728" offset="9758824">I turn now to the Act of 1831 which is the first Act that granted rights to widows and children and I note that the 1790 Act, which was our first Act, our first -- Congress enacted an Act which gave to the author the right to have a copyright of 14 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.441" offset="9821727">And if he was living at the end of the fourteenth year, he could renew for another 14 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.329" offset="9841267">1831 is the first time the women and children appeared on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.995" offset="9859971">This Act reads that if 1831 Act, that if at the expiration of the aforesaid term of years, such author be still living or being dead shall have left a widow or child or children, either or all of them living, the same exclusive right shall be continued to such author, designer, or engraver or if dead then to his widow and children -- widow and child or children was the word used for the further term of 14 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.828" offset="9995285">Now, this Act demonstrates three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.621" offset="10010436">First, it is clear that even in 1831, Congress did not wish to prefer a spouse to the children, treated them all alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.419" offset="10053590">And we all admit the 1831 statute very clearly demonstrates then to such widow and child or children for the further term of 14 years that they're all treated alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.270" offset="10089012">This is conceded by even in amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.646" offset="10110537">It is clear that even in 1831 then, that Congress did not prefer a widow over the child or children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.731" offset="10142824">Secondly, from this 1831 statute, we gather, that even in 1831, Congress saw no insurmountable problem regarding the percentage of how they were going to share, which was presented to us here yesterday by the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2647.312" offset="10589205">-- in my -- it is my view and the view, I believe, of the more eminent writers in this subject with which I am pleased to agree that the wife and children share pro rata to the number of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.008" offset="10655974">Another important incident of this Act of 1831 where the widow and children were first granted the right of renewal is that we noticed that in -- even in 1831, Congress saw no problem in the marketability of the product of the copyright where -- and here we have clearly that if someone wanted to get the entire right of the widow, and from 1831 on, and the children had to enter into the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.926" offset="10783660">And may I, at this time, suggest to Your Honor that there has been a clamor from the very inception of copyright by legislation of the library of Congress meeting call prior to the 1909 Act by the so-called class of assignees, the publisher's studios, and so forth, who buy properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.695" offset="10878746">They wanted a long term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.483" offset="10885851">They wanted to acquire all of the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.243" offset="10896927">This is going on and the subject has been studied time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.899" offset="10911556">And Congress has nevertheless, on each occasion, reenacted the split term of copyright in order to give that new protection to the dependents of the author, free and unfettered from agreements, arrangements made prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.970" offset="10983863">And frankly, this practical argument that they have to go to more than the -- just the widow for renewal right, is a bit suspicious because in the first place, in most writings, particularly music, there are always several collaborators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.980" offset="11043840">Each of them has an undivided interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.074" offset="11060245">There is always the next of kin who may be there to pick up the renewal right at the time that it accrues, maybe no wife or no children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.364" offset="11101414">Certainly, we don't know that the wife is going to survive 28 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.792" offset="11123148">We don't know who the next of kin is going to be, we'd only know a wife the man's going to be married to at the end of 28 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.955" offset="11147807">These problems are not new and they're multitudinous if one sets out to grasp the entire right that all persons may ever have in a particular copyright, in order to ensure themselves the continuation of 56 years of undisturbed possession of all rights under the copyright, he would have to contract with a great number of people including many that could not be known at the earlier date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.269" offset="11265045">Of course, under the arguments made, that the copyrights be worth more in the hands of the widow, she doesn't have to share with the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.931" offset="11299631">Well of course, this is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.152" offset="11312588">But we are mindful of the -- of the language of one of our great justices who've said that merely because something is worth more in the hands of one than in the hands of the other does not mean that one should lose his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.754" offset="11402971">In any event, we come to an adaption of the Act of 1870 following the adaption of the Act -- of the earlier Act of 1831 and adapting this Act, this is what the commissioners of revision stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.901" offset="11475592">They said, if the bill was examined by the Committee, that's the House Committee on revisions of laws and was found to embody all the provisions of existing law in brief, clear and precise language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.544" offset="11530136">We will remember that the earlier Act had in it considerable language, it wasn't necessary to the task.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.346" offset="11557303">And so the 1870 Act, so far as we're concerned, adapted the word that the author, if he be still living or his widow or children if he be dead, shall have the same exclusive right continued for the further term of 14 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.309" offset="11613205">And this is certainly a brief, clear, and concise language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.387" offset="11637447">The -- in 1909 or our present section as it now stands was so far pertinent here was concerned was adapted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.035" offset="11676108">There were acts pre -- there were bills proposed that the widow take first and the children second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.966" offset="11707768">However, those bills were completely rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.227" offset="11724904">And the report of the committee, the 60th Congress states among other things that instead of continuing the renew -- right of renewal to the author if still living or to the widow or children of the author if he be dead, we provide that the author of such work if still living may apply for the renewal or the widow, widower or children of the author if the author be not living or if such author, widow, widower or the children be not living, then the author's executors or the absence of will is next of kin may apply for the renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.190" offset="11880699">In this respect, even the 1909 Act retained the formulation of the preceding Acts and that's the Act of which we are confronted today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.595" offset="11914344">Now, we want to bear in mind that there were -- this Act of 1909, the Act of 1870, the reenactments and there were -- and reenactments in between and reenactments since and all during this time, the copyright officer charged with the administration of the statute have continuously and constantly taken the clear position which has been publicized to all that the children and the widow share equally in the renewal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.750" offset="12038896">There are instructions for renewing applications so show and this has been their practice and known to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.664" offset="12062616">That this is the better practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.546" offset="12070139">That this is the appropriate practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.218" offset="12076826">That this practice was publicized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.794" offset="12087171">It's clearly indicated in the briefs, by respondent's brief as well as in the brief filed by the Government, which shows that this has been the practice this many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.830" offset="12143282">And I am somewhat surprised that one would claim at this late date that this has not been the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.670" offset="12182674">Now, when it comes to interpreting our statute which I suggest by its four corners, evidence is that the women and the surviving husbands, surviving widowers and the children all share as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.381" offset="12245473">If we interpret it in accordance with equity and conscience, I think we must all agree that a child is as much in need of support as is a widow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.914" offset="12287582">A child is also a dependent and as a matter of fact, Mr. Justice Harlan holds the question yesterday as to whether if a widow renews a copyright, she then owns it all to the exclusion of a child if -- if the Court interpreted all that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.898" offset="12363546">And we suggest without painstaking that the law is very clear that if a widow was permitted to renew to the exclusion of the children, she would then own the entire copyright and if she died the next day, it would go to her estate and whoever she may devise or acquitted once it has been renewed or she could give it away, do whatever she may wish with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.528" offset="12454034">The child would have no interest whatsoever if this Court should happen to rule as contended for by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.087" offset="12484336">Now this, with the -- the -- there are many text writers, article writers in cases cited in our briefs and in the briefs of the Government with regard to the -- the opinion and the practice that the widow, widower, and children share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.774" offset="12579004">And because Mr. -- because the petitioner yesterday made some reference to a letter written by Mr. Ligon Johnson or to Mr. Ligon Johnson, I should like to read to this Court, if I may, a letter from Richard C. De Wolf, Acting Register of Copyright to Mr. Ligon Johnson on April 22, 1944 with respect to the same problem which he considers whether the widow, widower and children share together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.907" offset="12695615">The copyright office in this letter stated, “My own view is that there are -- they are members of one class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.229" offset="12728842">Consequently, one member of the class may file application for renewal and thereby obtain a legal title holding the renewal copyright in trust however by the other members of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.243" offset="12776908">If would seem to me that if it had been the intention to give the widow a right of renewal to the exclusion of the children, the language of the section would have read that the copyright could be renewed by the widow if the author is not living or if neither author nor widow is living, then by the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.580" offset="12858305">The tenor of the discussions in regard to the renewal provisions, as you may recall, and here we asked reference to discussions in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.404" offset="12893518">The tenor of discussion on the ground of renewal provision you may recall, seems to emphasize the desirability of the authors being able to provide for his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.131" offset="12924447">Let us suppose that an author has been married two or more times and that children survived him by an earlier marriage, then, do you think that the loss would intend the widow, that is, the person who was his wife at the time of his death to take the entire renewal copyright to the exclusion of the children?</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.454" offset="13005740">The difficulty in giving a valid title to the renewal copyright under the terms of the existing law is obvious as is frequently been brought to our attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.247" offset="13040953">However, it would be almost as great if the question were one of a number of children as it is with the widow included along with the children, so also of the next of kin or indeed of several joint authors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.278" offset="13105110">Petitioners make so-called practical arguments, and they argue that many deals fall through because they can't clear rights, well, frankly clearing rights, clearing expectancies that may accrue at the end of 28 years has always been a problem and one which the so-called assignee class as distinguished, if I may say, from the individual writer-author have always been concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.321" offset="13253277">And they have some difficulty in clearing them because human affairs do change, marriages change, then they have more children, more next of kin at the time the renewal right arises, and this is multiplied by the number of authors who contribute to a single work.That has never really posed a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.155" offset="13336555">Now we suggest to Your Honor that these matters outside the record such as the argument regarding the $500,000 deal lost by one of the studios, I believe we can say from our own knowledge that these deals are quite often lost for many reasons, most of which are generally unknown and certainly the record here is silent upon many such deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.565" offset="13430178">I believe that I may say without painstaking that as a practical matter, as a practical matter in this case has demonstrated that the child receives $100,000 out of performance royalties as -- and as a bonus more than what have been received by Mr. and Mrs. De Sylva.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.346" offset="13533309">I think I should point out to Mrs. De Sylva probably granted her rights some years ago was indicated by the amicus curiae briefs to some of the publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.248" offset="13568940">If she had those rights grant over again today, it would, of course, be much more valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.927" offset="13587644">And that was the intent and purpose of Congress, to protect those rights so that when they do become available, those people who are dependent can realize upon them fully and so that they are not fully disposed off before their true value is known and established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.108" offset="13656398">There are a great number of works that have been split in the second period between different publishers, one, two or more publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.932" offset="13695687">There is a reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.898" offset="13699553">There is an economic reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.099" offset="13708330">And, of course, although this Court can't decide this matter based upon economic reasons which don't appear, I suggest without apology and in the first place, there are literally many thousands of copyrights each year particularly a case and is for compositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.058" offset="13776144">But older copyrights would become lost and forgotten were it not for this renewal period and the right to go out and renegotiate and make a new deal and let somebody else -- somebody new put some money on it and exploit it to keep it available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.271" offset="13837061">Secondly, that it is true that over the first 28-year period, it may -- a publisher may become decadent for that matter or retire from the business and merely wait until the public comes and finds the article and purchase it from him before he is duly bound to pay a royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.064" offset="13924206">And it is our opinion that renewal period were realized more if those who obtained the renewal are free to deal with it in their own fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.386" offset="13993482">We're cognizant of the fact this Court has ruled the Fisher versus Witmark case announced by Mr. Justice Frankfurter that the author himself has the right to agree to assign his renewal if and when he should survive and acquire it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.614" offset="14062446">And I assume that by the same token, others could grant their renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.268" offset="14085016">I should mention that decision -- there were some dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.975" offset="14111869">Justice Douglas and Justice -- Justice -- Mr. Justice Black, I believe, contended even there that the author should not be permitted to part with -- to agree to part with his renewal right if and when he survived to receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.387" offset="14173518">And it indicates the desire of Congress and the Act itself to at least preserve this renewal rights so that when they do accrue, they maybe realized upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.590" offset="14218344">It's true the author may deal with his renewal right only if he lives and survives to renew it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3612.228" offset="14448849">Now, I repeat again, if I may, that the arguments that this copyright should be free and unfettered and so that the assignee, so-called class of assignees are free to go out and deal with them and tie them for the -- for a 56-year period so that assignees would have less people to deal with when they go out to acquire a copyright and to ensure themselves the posterity in that copyright.</text>
