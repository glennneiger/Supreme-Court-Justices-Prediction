            <label>Mr. Charles J. Margiotti</label>
            <text syncTime="34.123" offset="136464">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.671" offset="150674">Please Your Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.928" offset="163631">This is an appeal from the Third Circuit of Pennsylvania in which a decision of board of three -- by a decision board of three, a decision of the District Court refusing the petitioner a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.885" offset="259448">I'll the give the Court some history of the case only as it pertains this particular matter because the killing in the case occurred in December of 1947, the particular petition giving rise to this appeal was not filed until April of 1951 and prior to that time means -- other -- other appeals have been taken to the Supreme Court, the matter had come to this Court too, under the (Inaudible) case and there's no necessity in going into that history unless the Court is interested and if it'd be hard -- had the -- for I'll answer any particular question that is asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.491" offset="469891">So, I'll begin particularly with the filing of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.174" offset="492669">A petition was filed before his Honor, Judge Murphy of the Middle District to Pennsylvania at Scranton.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.596" offset="534361">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania although served with the copy of the petition, did not file an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.921" offset="579605">In that petition, for the first time were raised three important questions, all based upon the fact that was claimed by the petitioner that he had been deprived of a fair and impartial trial in violation of -- of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.837" offset="675318">Now, those facts were not facts that appeared on the record at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.562" offset="698201">The Court had a transcript of the proceeding of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.323" offset="717218">But there was nothing before the Court on the very questions that were raised of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.081" offset="752222">As I said, the Commonwealth filed no answer to that petition and fixed the -- the judge fixed the date for a hearing or for argument rather, and I was required to go from Pittsburg to Scranton by automobile, encountered an unexpected detour that took me a little more time.I was late 20 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.446" offset="869773">When I got to Court I found that the judge had decided the case and had -- had denied the writ without any answer filed on the part of the Commonwealth to the various allegations of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.244" offset="944901">And then after -- and he wrote an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.613" offset="962351">And after the opinion was filed, about a week or two after the opinion was filed, the Commonwealth filed an answer, nunc pro tunc, in connection with the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.103" offset="1016372">There was an appeal taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.709" offset="1038733">On that occasion by a decision of four-to-three, the case was remanded to the same judge to hear the facts on issues raised by the averments of the petition, although, denied by the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.764" offset="1127027">And so, we proceeded to a hearing before his Honor, Judge Murphy, the same judge, which lasted about eight days in which much testimony was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.033" offset="1184078">At the time the first petition was filed, it was contended by us by the petitioner that the defendant had received an unfair trial in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.700" offset="1250743">That he was not, while he had counsel, although counsel had been employed by his father, that counsel paid no attention to the case and interviewed of about a half hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.413" offset="1317616">And that -- that he did not prepare the defense, didn't introduce any defense, told the defendant he was not required, not going to take the witness stand and he made the decision for the defendant although it was necessary for him to go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.715" offset="1382818">Didn't introduce any character evidence, evidence was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.052" offset="1400163">And didn't introduce any psychiatric test upon that question was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.130" offset="1432451">So, we raised the question at the -- the trial was a sham trial with no defense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.244" offset="1464947">We also raised the question, he was tried in a -- a -- an atmosphere of his theory and that he could possibly get a fair trial under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.053" offset="1492114">And furthermore, that a judge who had tried two codefendants on the case, Judge Boyer, had been guilty of such misconduct as to deprive the defendant and petitioner of a fair and impartial trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.731" offset="1618860">Well, then that case was disposed of by the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.821" offset="1651252">They returned us to the same judge to present the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.620" offset="1690436">They eliminated the question of the ability of the trial lawyer, the defense lawyer, as to whether or not he really gave to this defendant a -- a fair trial himself, now, whether he had -- act as a lawyer should do on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.588" offset="1766296">Now, the only reason I'm quoting that is because, while they eliminated that question, we took out all evidence on that question at the hearing before Judge Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.257" offset="1816973">And yet in the opinion that followed from which we have appealed, they refer several times to the fact that the defendant had a good trial lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.705" offset="1862740">That his lawyer didn't do this and his lawyer didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.074" offset="1880294">And so, in one instance, when we raised the question, we're told we can't raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.996" offset="1903909">And when we don't raise it they say he was a good lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.112" offset="1916447">And so he's out of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.463" offset="1921776">I am only calling that to your attention because that question may arise during the course of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.162" offset="1948630">And we confined ourselves to the two questions which is, of course, that it was the mandate of the Circuit Court required us to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.706" offset="1998785">And that was first, whether there was such a -- such a -- such prejudice to us to do the exterior in the community that deprived the defendant of an unfair -- of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.214" offset="2064823">And second, the misconduct if any of the so-called -- of the so-called misconduct of Judge Boyer who had tried the previous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.411" offset="2121561">And so, the evidence was presented around these two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.581" offset="2150296">Now, in order to make my position clear, I'll give you only a short statement of the facts just enough to know what the killing, how the killing occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.645" offset="2210482">The defendant was 22 years of age up until the time he admit.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.354" offset="2245381">Three other defendants had borne a very good reputation and had been a good boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.777" offset="2279027">He was a son of a tipstaff of a court in Philadelphia, Judge Brack's tipstaff and he had been mentally afflicted and had some mere trouble, but he met with this bad company.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.321" offset="2385189">And they engaged in some robberies, several of them, maybe 10 or 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.986" offset="2415909">I don't remember the exact number prior to this particular one.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.067" offset="2440255">On this occasion while he was at home, asleep, they went awakened him and he went with his companions to the scene of the killings.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.081" offset="2484245">Now, what happened there was that they went in to an inn called the Feasterville Inn -- Feasterville's Inn.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.389" offset="2513502">There they held up a bartender and rifled the cash register.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.127" offset="2540460">There were some shots fired on the inside but nobody was killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.292" offset="2561149">And -- although someone died years later beyond the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.872" offset="2599393">However, I have pointed the year and the day afterwards whether he died as the result of the shot or not, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.828" offset="2615275">But that's not involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.348" offset="2625306">But as the four were leaving the Feasterville Inn, the Zeitz, the leader of the organization, driving the automobile with his one hand on the car and the other, he fired a shot out the window and he shot at a bystander named Kelly and killed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.914" offset="2711615">The defendant was in the car at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.585" offset="2730318">Now, he had participated in the robbery and participated, of course, getting away from there, that's what he was doing at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.675" offset="2770651">And under the law of Pennsylvania, a killing that occurs in perpetration of robbery, is murder of the first agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.111" offset="2808372">And furthermore, the jury hearing the case has the duty to fix the penalty if they find a person guilty of murder in the first degree, either a death or life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.716" offset="2874828">And --</text>

            <text syncTime="789.354" offset="3157368">At least the person whom he's tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.418" offset="3169593">Now, furthermore, in Pennsylvania where four -- where two or more persons are charged with murder, indicted with murder, they have -- the right of severance is given to them as a matter of right to the question of discretion in the Court at all, a matter of right just to protect the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.165" offset="3280562">In this particular case, our question came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.287" offset="3305117">The judge expressed the opinion that he hoped that they wouldn't ask for such a severance because it would cause the county an awful lot of money and to take a lot of time, and said so in open Court at the time the matter was heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.962" offset="3379827">But at any rate, it was insisted that there was a severance.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.432" offset="3397695">And so there was severance granted and the defendant obtained a trial by himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.341" offset="3429355">So, they put the first persons, call for trial, were two, Foster and Zeitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.923" offset="3463628">Now, Zeitz is the man who fired the shot and the four, of course, Foster did not fire any shots at all but he was in-company with.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.844" offset="3507304">And they were tried together.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.675" offset="3522664">And immediately thereafter, bear in mind, not a week or two afterwards, but the very next trial there, after the result of the first case, this defendant was put on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.479" offset="3581910">That the trial terminated on Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.703" offset="3594762">They couldn't try him on Saturday or Sunday, but they put up on trial on Monday morning, June the 4th.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.516" offset="3622034">June 4th was the date and he -- when the trial began -- or June the 7th, pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.853" offset="3659337">Now, the -- we showed at the time of the -- in our hearing to show our prejudice and feeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.821" offset="3715239">We showed evidence from publications of newspapers both daily and weekly newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.779" offset="3751079">Bucks County is a county that has small communities in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.262" offset="3785038">Doylestown, I believe, is the largest but Doylestown and Bristol are probably the largest towns in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.430" offset="3805623">And most of the county is rural.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.219" offset="3816803">And there are numerous -- there are several daily papers, the one daily paper of several weekly papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.269" offset="3845016">But the Philadelphia Metropolitan paper, the county is next to Philadelphia, circulate quite freely in Bucks -- in Bucks County.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.494" offset="3889946">Now, we showed by publication that there was much publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.571" offset="3914188">That the people of the county had become indignant over this killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.193" offset="3932682">And I can understand it because of the nature of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.498" offset="3953894">And that they referred to them as bandits and trigger-happy boys and thugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.550" offset="3978136">They were boastful and they were callous.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.634" offset="3990465">They were holdup men.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.084" offset="3996317">They were gangsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.126" offset="4004467">They particularly referred to them as being Philadelphians and they had not business crossing county lines and coming into Bucks County where decent people lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.052" offset="4044173">They were hard boiled and many statements of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.134" offset="4068519">And then, there were many editorials calling to the attention of the -- of the people, the duty of jurors in cases of this type, what they were required to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.935" offset="6331664">Now, here's the -- like I call your attention, Your Honor, to page 1248, Volume 4 of the -- of petitioner's transcript of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.363" offset="6441378">He said that the -- the Circuit's or the Court says, "That most it indicates that during two weeks" and, of course, we contend that all these feeling became more intense because it published all the testimony of the case during the other trial, and was done during, just immediately before the defendant was put on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.069" offset="6544196">That -- that most it indicates that during the two weeks, immediately preceding the relator trial, the community in general, had experienced a revival and quickening of interest in the homicide attended by many expressions of indignations against its perpetrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.701" offset="6614727">But it does not appear that feeling ran so high that hostility towards the relator was so intense and so general as to make it seem incredible that the search for a satisfactory jury would yield 12 persons as open minded about this case as the juries here claimed to have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.599" offset="6706364">The situation certainly would have justified a decision to wait a while before trying the relator and I've asked, Your Honor, Judge -- Judge Minton and -- or else to try him in another community if, Justice Minton pardon me, if trial immediately after conviction of his confederates was deemed important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.281" offset="6797061">We may be persuaded that in the circumstances it would have been wise to take such precautions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.279" offset="6825064">If not convinced, the failure to follow up that the wiser course was a denial of the absence of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.208" offset="6860800">Now, that -- that was what the -- what the majority of the -- the majority opinion said on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.798" offset="6891102">And the -- Judge Kalodner didn't refer to that at all in his dissenting opinion and Judge Biggs -- and Judge Biggs' opinion he said which is not very long but very short into the point, said Darcy was tried -- Darcy was tried -- Darcy's trial was so distorted by circumstances both in and out of the courtroom has to result in the fundamental -- in fundamental unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.986" offset="7071869">The brutal crime committed by Darcy, Foster, Zeitz and Capone had angered the citizens of Bucks County by editorials, new stories and comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.363" offset="7113352">The press prejudiced Darcy's case and prejudiced the minds of the citizens that were against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.684" offset="7154730">I cannot believe that all members of the jury remained uninfluenced by these publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.343" offset="7189316">So, Darcy had been granted a separate trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.720" offset="7202795">The service was worthless when it was proceeded with only three days after the -- that this proceeding was only three days after the other trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.276" offset="7241038">Now, then that's what was said on the question of publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.240" offset="7252950">Now, comes the question of the conduct of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.477" offset="7265907">And that is probably the most important thing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.804" offset="7287118">Judge Boyer, by the way in that -- in that county, they do not wear robes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.426" offset="7309688">At least they weren't at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.554" offset="7322122">There were two judges, Judge Boyer had tried the Foster-Zeitz case and Judge Keller was trying the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.083" offset="7364232">And the -- Judge -- Judge Boyer was a well respected citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.126" offset="7400490">He'd been elected twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.451" offset="7405714">He'd been District Attorney of the County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.822" offset="7415223">He'd been appointed District Attorney and elected District Attorney and he's a pretty well known citizen there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.124" offset="7440405">Undoubtedly, he carried a great deal of weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.257" offset="7457019">Now, his statements about the guilt of the defendants and particularly where you have a question of the -- the death penalty being warranted in both whether the -- whether the individual fired the shot and where the individual, the other defendant did not fire the shot and we were trying -- they were trying the case at the time of a defendant who had fired no shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.466" offset="7573838">That would have some bearing, we believe, on -- on the jury if they knew the -- the judge's feelings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.504" offset="7601946">However, here's what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.875" offset="7607484">The judge during the Darcy case, entered the courtroom and he sat on the bench with the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.973" offset="7643847">Now, several times and engaged in whispered conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.875" offset="7667461">Nobody could tell what they were whispering about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.583" offset="7678328">And I contend that that's far worse because the jury could imagine almost anything under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.999" offset="7707899">Whispered conversations, on one occasion, he participated in a ruling and that's part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.799" offset="7747187">It's referred to in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.323" offset="7753247">He -- he sat then, participated in the ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.471" offset="7765786">It was a side bar matter and Mr. Achey, who was trying the case for the defendant, objected his conduct and to his participating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.870" offset="7815419">And he said, and it's interesting to note that his language was, "I don't mind trying this case against one judge but," and then he was cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.258" offset="7857006">And Judge Boyer said, "Well, we judges -- we're not required to obtain counsel's permission to confer among ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.356" offset="7901414">We're not required to have your permission to do that."</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.494" offset="7913953">And he remained on the bench.</text>

            <text syncTime="2850.601" offset="11402344">And he said they did.</text>

            <text syncTime="2871.025" offset="11484056">All he says, "I can't tell this, I can't rationalize my memory."</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.918" offset="11503595">Well, I said, "Let's see now, you -- you objected to what was said concerning second degree and first degree murder in flight or unintentional killing," "Yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.254" offset="11569006">Well, I said, "When would you make up your mind to make an objection of that kind?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.974" offset="11599830">Why, he says immediately after I heard her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.297" offset="11613100">Well, he had heard it long before that because it came long before that as is shown in our record -- please turn to that page -- and we have showed, pointed out in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.940" offset="11663673">And if he had that in his mind, that's when he would have done it just at time the judge made the mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.455" offset="11689796">Or if he didn't do it then when the judge said, "Do you have anything to say?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.665" offset="11710589">He would have gotten up and he would have then made his objection because that was his first opportunity to speak without interrupting the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.536" offset="11754057">In place of that when the Court asked him, he had nothing to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.715" offset="11770776">He said, nothing at all but just sat there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.560" offset="11786240">Now, the day after that he got up and made his objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.042" offset="11800137">Now, something had to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.662" offset="11810586">A nod, a prod, a touching of the foot, a touching of the arm, something had to happen that calls to that lawyer's attention to get up there and make that objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.313" offset="11873176">And so you have that further fact to consider as to whether or not this -- this testimony should have been received by the Court and he should have rendered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.155" offset="11916539">He'd found the facts as we claim them to find them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.344" offset="11933362">And I think that by reading the record as a whole, Your Honor, as you go along, reading the record and questions that were asked by Judge Murphy, keeping in mind that he's the same judge, that in this case after I make it a charge that we did in our petition originally, that he rendered a decision against us and denied the writ without even an opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.950" offset="12039732">And it was the same judge that was -- that made -- made the -- made the decision here, as reading the record and observing very, very carefully what the -- his -- his demeanor and his questions that he asked.</text>

            <text syncTime="3122.379" offset="12489456">After -- after the conspirators left the Feasterville Tavern, they continued on to another tavern and committed another robbery the same night.</text>

            <text syncTime="3143.171" offset="12572630">At that trial, the defendant was represented by Webster Achey and on appeal was represented by Mr. Thomas D.McBride present chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar who is present in court today.</text>
