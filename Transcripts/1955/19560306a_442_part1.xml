            <label>Mr. David I. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="21.009" offset="84010">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.032" offset="96026">Effective January 20, 1954, Kendrick M. Cole, a World War II veteran, was dismissed from his federal job on the ground that his continued employment was not clearly consistent with the interest of the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.194" offset="180767">This is an appeal from a two-to-one decision of the Court of Appeals below which upheld the dismissal of the petitioner's complaint and the granting of respondent's motion for cross judgment on the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.423" offset="249626">It is conceded by respondents that petitioner Cole, in his job, had no access to any government secrets or classified information, that he could not influence or make policy in his particular position, and that he was not charged with being a disloyal employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.534" offset="354116">In this last connection, I think I should refer to the respondent's brief in the Court below where they said, and I'd like to quote, “The charges against appellant,” Mr. Cole in that case, “do not imply any knowing acts of disloyalty on his part.”</text>
            <text syncTime="107.135" offset="428513">That's at page 6 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.724" offset="438857">And, on page 17, I quote again, “As appellant correctly said, in the charges made against me, I am not accused of doing or saying anything which would indicate that I am disloyal to the Government of this country.”</text>
            <text syncTime="127.657" offset="510537">We contend that, on these conceded facts, former Secretary Hobby could not have discharged Mr. Cole under public law 733, the 1950 security risk Statute for sensitive agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.146" offset="580545">We contend that that statute is not applicable to a loyal employee holding a nonsensitive, non-policy making position in an agency whose functions are not directly related to this nation's military, foreign affairs, or preparedness programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.016" offset="699977">We raise the constitutional argument only in connection with the interpretation of the statute and we say that we think the Court would have to reach the constitutional question if it held that the statute could properly be applicable to Mr. Cole's dismissal.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.945" offset="831739">Is that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="215.725" offset="862877">Secondly, Section 3 of the statute which authorize the President to extend the provisions of Section 1 of the law, that's the substantive provisions of the law, to other agencies and departments of the Government when he deemed it necessary in the best interest of the national security to do so, we say, did not authorize him to establish a single rigid minimum standard for all federal employment, sensitive and non sensitive alike, in each and every agency and department of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.046" offset="1032150">And, that standard, that single rigid minimum standard, was the standard clearly consistent with the interest of the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.122" offset="1072483">Even if we were to assume --</text>

            <text syncTime="274.144" offset="1096516">You say that the Government couldn't -- couldn't establish a single standard for security?</text>

            <text syncTime="280.729" offset="1122847">What we are saying, Your Honor, is that the President under Section 3 of this statute which authorized him to extend it to other agencies selectively, just merely to extend the statute, didn't authorize him to extend under the statute a single rigid standard for all kinds of employees within the particular departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.712" offset="1230785">We contend that the authority he had was to extend the statute to the entire Government, but he couldn't establish, for all kinds of employment within the particular agencies themselves, a single standard for determining the security status of employees.</text>

            <label>Mr. David I. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="366.149" offset="1464529">The answer, sir, is found in Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2 of the constitution where Congress has spoken with respect to inferior offices and employees of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.595" offset="1510296">It is my understanding of the law that Congress can properly restrict his removal power.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.519" offset="1534015">What do you with the Meyers case, where Congress actually passed the statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="387.677" stopTime="401.363">
            <label>Mr. David I. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="387.677" offset="1550629">Well, I think, Your Honor, that in the Meyers case, we had a completely different situation because the employee in that question -- in that case, I understand, was the type of employee who was appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="401.363" stopTime="412.229">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="401.363" offset="1605381">And, the Senate imposed a qualification, and the President said that this Court sustained him that you can't make any rules on the inherent power of the President.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="412.229" stopTime="451.705">
            <label>Mr. David I. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="412.229" offset="1648849">Well, I think that that case is not applicable to a situation where the Congress has vested the appointing power in the agency heads rather than in the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.685" offset="1702661">And, in this particular case, the appointing power was vested in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.403" offset="1729515">Therefore, since Congress vested the appointing power in the agency head, it could also restrict the power of the agency head with respect to such acts as the Lloyd-LaFollette Acts and the Veterans' Preference Acts which, I understand, are valid restrictions upon the executive's removal power.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.771" offset="1867024">I don't know, sir.</text>

          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="468.152" stopTime="483.825">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="468.152" offset="1872562">I just wonder what's the scope of that case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.281" offset="1885100">I could assure you, that left me not on the problem of the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.589" offset="1910282">However, the Government doesn't raise that point.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="483.825" stopTime="921.789">
            <label>Mr. David I. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="483.825" offset="1935256">We contend that, with respect to this standard established by the executive order, this clearly consistent standard, that it established a much more onerous burden on Mr. Cole than the necessary or advisable standard which was established by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.469" offset="2021773">Now, apart from any other consideration, we contend that the dismissal motives of the secretary, which was furnished to Mr. Cole on about January 15, 1954 and which stated that his continued employment was not clearly consistent with the interest of the national security, was not a written statement of the decision of the agency head as that term was used by Congress in public law 733, the statute under which Mr Cole was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.208" offset="2152803">The facts of this case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.636" offset="2166491">As I said before, Mr. Cole was a food and drug inspector and his job was to inspect for health regulatory and other purposes those foods, drugs, and cosmetics which are normally subject to federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.857" offset="2227409">As a Veterans' Preference eligible, he was covered by both the Veterans' Preference and Lloyd-LaFollette Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.503" offset="2253949">On November 13, 1953, he was suspended from his job pursuant to an investigation under Executive Order 10450.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.565" offset="2298253">A few days later, he received a set of charges which alleged that he had a close association with individuals who were reliably reported to be communists, and a sympathetic association with an organization listed as subversive by the Attorney General, the Nature Friends of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.561" offset="2386233">On December 23rd of that year, while just coming out of the hospital from a very serious operation, Mr. Cole wrote a letter refusing to make any explanation of these charges claiming that they violated his inherent basic right of freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.419" offset="2453629">He was then informed that the matter was being referred to the secretary for her determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.315" offset="2473169">And, on January 15th, effective January 20, 1954, he was dismissed from his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.423" offset="2505665">Seven days after the effective date of his dismissal, Mr. Cole's counsel wrote a letter to the secretary which requested a reopening of his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.452" offset="2541714">And, although Mr. Cole offered to prove that he had not knowingly maintained any association with any member of the Communist Party, that his relationship with the Nature Friends of America was completely casual and entirely innocent, that he had specifically refused to become a member of that organization, at the -- that the only donations he had ever made to it were $2 for firewood that he had used at one time on a camping trip, the secretary refused him permission to reopen the case and to have a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.894" offset="2667520">And, when she did that, she stated that she had considered this information, as well as other information.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.320" offset="2693224">On February 10th, 1954, counsel requested reconsideration of the denial of the right to reopen and claimed the violation of the Veterans' Preference Act and invalidity of the particular charges and the executive order, but the request for reconsideration was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.990" offset="2763860">The next day, Mr. Cole appealed to the United States Civil Service Commission not only from the original dismissal action, but from the two subsequent adverse determinations as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.600" offset="2810358">And, he contended that all three were in violation of his rights under Section 14 of the Veterans' Preference Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.707" offset="2842749">Now, on March 3rd, 1954, the Regional Civil Service Commission refused jurisdiction of Mr. Cole's appeal from any of the three adverse determinations on the ground that public law 733, as extended to the Department of Health, Education, and welfare by Executive Order 10450, had cut off his otherwise mandatory right of appeal as a Veterans' Preference eligible, under the Veterans' Preference Act, to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.784" offset="2963122">Now, on May 5, 1954, United States Civil Service Commission in Washington, to which the regional commissioner's ruling had been appealed, affirmed the decision of the Regional Commission and, three weeks thereafter, this action was instituted in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.512" offset="3045982">Now, public law 733 provides in substance, basically, that certain named agency heads, I think approximately ten agencies originally dealing with national defense, may similarly suspend and, thereafter, terminate employees in their absolute discretion when necessary or advisable in the interest of the national security of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.243" offset="3156950">In other words, when they deem employees to be security risks, but an employee who is not disloyal, who has no access to classified material or government secrets of any kind, who is not a policy maker, who is not employed in an agency whose functions bear no relationship to this nation's defense, foreign relations, or preparedness programs cannot be dismissed under the statute because his dismissal cannot be justified in the interest of the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.014" offset="3308042">In other words, he is not a security risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.748" offset="3326955">We do not merely rely on a definition of the statutory term “the interest of the national security,” a term which certainly is not free from vagueness and a term under which the allowable area of executive discretion is quite large.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.331" offset="3389231">But, we say that that term has limits, some limits somewhere and that this, certainly, is a case beyond those limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.307" offset="3433221">Respondents say otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.751" offset="3438968">They say it's without any limits whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.625" offset="3454433">And, for this, we rely on the statute primarily which, itself, provides for the reemployment of discharged employees in nonsensitive agencies and positions but, unmistakably also, we rely on the clearly expressed purpose and intent of the Congress in enacting this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.463" offset="3553802">That purpose was to provide a permanent legislative authority for the summary termination of employees whose character and associations, when considered in relation to the sensitivity of the particular type of work they were doing, made it necessary or advisable that they could not continue to hold down jobs which were vitally involved in our defense and preparedness programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.261" offset="3664980">That was the expressed Congressional purpose behind public law 733.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.324" offset="3881273">Judicial authorities in cases decided under comparable security programs have similarly defined the term, “the interest of the national security.”</text>
            <text syncTime="980.869" offset="3923383">And, the term was defined in the way that petitioner defines it, by the National Security Council's Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security whose report, in 1952, on the government employee security program is set forth in relevant parts in Appendix B of our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.579" offset="4018260">All of these authorities define the interest of the national security solely in relation to those specific matters which vitally affect this nation's military, preparedness, and foreign relations programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.693" offset="4074684">All of the authorities are in complete agreement that the term has absolutely no relationship to, and definitely excludes, those programs and functions of Government which, while intimately connected with the welfare and happiness of the country's people, are not directly related to those programs and functions of Government intimately and directly related to the national safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.306" offset="4181159">Now, Mr. Cole's job bears as much relationship to the national safety, this job of food and drug inspector, as does the job of any butcher in any meat cutting plant, of any baker in any bakery, or of a leaf raker out on the lawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.595" offset="4258377">And, if this was what was meant by Congress when it enacted this particular statute, we think the statute was meaningless because the result that respondents claim that Congress intended could have been achieved in much more simply than by this statute merely by repealing each and every one of the civil service statues on the federal statute clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.684" offset="4350642">Since Mr. Cole had no access to any classified information or government secrets, any associations he might have with alleged subversives could not conceivably have resulted even in his inadvertent disclosure of classified information of government secrets because he didn't have any access to any such material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.806" offset="4439144">And, a graphic example of this is contained in this kind of situation even if we were to assume that Mr. Cole had a communist wife, and by the way he is a bachelor, the fact that he might talk in his sleep would cause to be revealed only nonsensitive, non-classified, non-secret information, information available at any public library of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.543" offset="4534126">Since he is not charged with disloyalty, by very definition of this Court in the case of Ex Parte Mitsuye Endo, he cannot be deemed a potential saboteur of the food supply, so that we have in this case neither potential espionage, nor potential sabotage, nor potential even inadvertent disclosure of classified or secret information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.107" offset="4640392">Thus, we don't think that the respondents can seriously argue to this Court that Mr. Cole's discharge can be justified in the statutory interest, the interest of the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.288" offset="4693055">We are not saying that Mr. Cole could not ever be discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.504" offset="4713953">What we are saying is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.031" offset="4724088">Even if we assume that the President could validly have extended the statute to each and every agency of the Government, former Secretary Hobby, Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare could not validly have dismissed Mr. Cole under this statute on these conceded facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.503" offset="4825966">That's our first argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.372" offset="4837460">Perhaps an even stronger argument is contained right in Section 3 of the statute which authorize the President to extend, as I said before, the substantive provisions of the law to such other departments and agencies of the Government as he might selectively, from time to time, deem necessary in the best interest of the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.829" offset="4927216">And, in April of 1953, the President did issue Executive Order 10450 which not only extended this particular statute to each and every agency and department of the Government, but it extended it to each and every employee in each and every agency, no matter how sensitive or non-sensitive the job held by that employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.099" offset="5040379">And, this extension was coupled with a mandatory direction to each and every agency head requiring them to judge each and every employee under their supervision and control by the same mutually consistent and no less than minimum standard that is clearly consistent with the interest of the national security standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.489" offset="5121881">At the same time, the President revoked the loyalty program which had been established by Executive Order 9835 and which was under consideration by this Court in Peters against Hobby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.733" offset="5166916">Now, under 9835, employees had been permitted to appeal from the adverse decision to a special independent review authority in the United States Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.676" offset="5214668">However, under Public Rule of 733, an agency head's determination is final and the employee cannot appeal where the statute, of course, is validly applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.672" offset="5254687">Now, under Public Rule of 733, an examination of the statute discloses that Congress vested discretion in agency and department heads to determine which positions within their particular departments and agencies would have been covered under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.438" offset="5321665">Congress also vested them with discretion to dismiss employees when the particular agency head concerned deemed it necessary or advisable, in the interest of the national security, that those employees be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.326" offset="5377254">And, Congress also vested them with discretion to reinstatement, suspended employees to duty not only to the position from which they had been suspended, but to some, perhaps, less sensitive position within the particular agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.164" offset="5428558">However, let's examine the executive order now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.874" offset="5443396">Under its mandatory provisions, the statutory discretion to determine which positions within a particular agency are to be covered under the Act and which are not has now been effectively divested by the requirement of the executive order that all positions within a particular agency, including the position of washroom attendant at a branch post office, must be clearly consistent with the interest of the national security of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.929" offset="5555618">Under the executive order, an agency has -- no longer has discretion to determine that it is necessary or advisable to dismiss employee Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.151" offset="5592503">He must dismiss employee Jones unless he can affirmatively establish that employee Jones' continued employment is clearly consistent with national security.</text>

            <text syncTime="1434.336" offset="5737326">The necessary or advisable standard used by Congress in the statute is used in two senses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.068" offset="6220173">Now, the agency head hasn't got any discretion to say that a leaf raker shouldn't come within the particular provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.631" offset="6246504">The leaf raker, by very perforce by the executive order, is covered under the statute and there isn't any question about it anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.518" offset="6273985">Now, secondly, with respect to the standards -- the difference in the standards, there is clearly consistent standard as contrasted with the necessary or advisable standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.019" offset="6320065">It was also used by Congress and by the executive order as a standard of termination because the agency had, when it comes time to decide whether the suspended employee shall be reinstated to the suspended position or dropped from his particular position, he must find as an affirmative proposition not that it is necessary or advisable that this employee should be dismissed or discharged, but that he must be discharged unless he can't affirmatively find that his continued employment is clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.</text>

            <text syncTime="1943.803" offset="7775190">I'd like to point this out, and I think it's pretty clear because I think this is decisive, and I think it's directly related to your question, Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.513" offset="7818031">If you will compare Section 6 of the Executive Order with Section 7 of the Executive Order, Section 6 follows virtually in haec verba the standards of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.532" offset="7886054">Section 7 establishes the clearly consistent standard with terminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.132" offset="7912490">Now, Section 6 of the Executive Order relates only to suspensions, not to retention or termination once an employee has been suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.330" offset="7961287">And, although the respondent say that ours was a case which had to do with suspension, the record clearly establishes that it has to do with termination because we don't complain about the suspension in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.706" offset="8010815">We complain about Mr. Cole's termination effective January 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.669" offset="8038609">Whenever the statute is followed by the executive order, the agency head has discretion, as in the case of suspensions where Section 6 applies, to weigh the relationship between the sensitivity of the work and the seriousness of the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.866" offset="8123455">But, when it comes to Section 7 of the Executive Order, which follows the clearly consistent standard and not the necessary or advisable standard as does Section 6, there, the agency head does not have discretion to weigh the sensitivity of the work in relationship to the seriousness of the charges except in one kind of case, and that's the 8 (a)(1) case which deals primarily with employee suitability, drug addiction, alcoholism, and the like, but not with subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.757" offset="8270994">So, on the facts of this case, Mr. Cole could not be dismissed as a security risk because he had no access to any security material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.958" offset="8315820">He could not be dismissed as disloyal because the Government concedes that he is loyal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.851" offset="8339331">He was dismissed because he is a new creature, a new creature created solely and exclusively by this executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.007" offset="8367961">He's a non-disloyal subversive and the executive order proposed the continued employment of all non-disloyal subversives, even from the job of porter in the branch post office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.405" offset="8437551">That's what this executive order does on the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.911" offset="8455628">We think clearly, therefore, that Mr. Cole was not fired under the standards established by the Congress and the record, that's page 21 of the record, clearly shows that Mrs. Hobby dismissed him under the clearly consistent standard because she said, “I have determined that your continued retention in employment is not clearly consistent with the interest of the national security.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2167.280" offset="8669100">Now, I'd like to make clear that we do not attack the power of the Congress to enact a statute worded in the manner of this executive order but, merely, the attempt of the President to substitute his own standards for those of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.529" offset="8726047">And, we say that the fact of the President's lack of power cannot be dispelled as the respondents would have this Court do by leaning on the President's removal power absent congressional limitations on those powers because, here, we say that Congress has validly restricted the President's removable power in the Lloyd-LaFollette and Veterans' Preference Acts, and in Public Law 733 itself, which we say carves out an area of exception to these otherwise valid restrictions, the Lloyd-LaFollette and Veterans' Preference Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.693" offset="8874736">And, we say the boundary lines of that area of exception are the legitimate interest of the national security and, on these facts, this is a case which is clearly beyond those limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.216" offset="9068774">It says, “The provisions of Sections 22-1 to 22-3 of this title shall apply to such other departments and agencies of the Government as the President may, from time to time, deem necessary in the best interest of national security.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.082" offset="9132304">And then, it goes on to say “if any departments or agencies are included to the -- by the President, they must so be reported to the Senate Armed Services Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3069.855" offset="12279327">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.786" offset="12299076">The Court will have observed, I believe, that petitioner's argument depends largely upon the reiteration of a series of catch phrases like security risk, access to classified information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.910" offset="12367621">He even has a loyal subversive catch phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.428" offset="12389669">The significant fact is that none of those phrases, with which he weaves his argument, is to be found in the statute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.290" offset="12433136">I think, in considering the first question as to the permissible reach of the statute, it may be well to devote a minute to consider the situation which existed in the executive branch of the Government prior to its enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.955" offset="12495726">At that time, there were enforced two or three special statutes limited to the Navy, the Army, and the Coast Guard which gave the heads of those agencies summary dismissal power in the interest of the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.578" offset="12570227">Those are not the precise words of those statutes but in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.270" offset="12593006">In addition, there was then in effect a so-called Government employees' loyalty program which have been promulgated in 1947 by Executive Order 9835.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.709" offset="12658834">That program, beyond dispute, was applicable to all employees and officers in the executive branch of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.269" offset="12713064">Apparently, it was felt that the legal authority then in the possession of the executive branch, with respect to dismissal in the security interest, was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.218" offset="12768862">And, the primary reason that that was felt seems to have been that there were many people who were not disloyal in the sense that they had a conscious disattachment to the principles of our constitution, but they may be dope addicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.330" offset="12861231">They could be drunkards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.407" offset="12869590">They could suffer from mental illnesses or they could, as Mr. Justice Reed commented, they could be closely associated with communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.133" offset="12920477">And, it was felt that such a person, although not disloyal in the sense that I have indicated, nevertheless, his presence in the job is a detrimental factor to the overall national security of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.793" offset="12991112">And, this law was passed to give the executive branch an overall authority to deal with those problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="3260.460" offset="13041789">Yes, the statute here involved which we frequently refer to as Public Law 733.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.494" offset="13073972">Now, if I may direct the Court's attention for a moment to the exact language of Public Law 733.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.429" offset="13097691">It seems to me that petitioner has not dealt with it as extensively as it deserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.654" offset="13118589">It is set forth in the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.913" offset="13131651">And, it starts out that, notwithstanding the probations of any other law, the heads -- the named heads of 11 agencies Navy, Army, Air force, Justice, Treasury, Commerce, and a few others, that each such head may, in his absolute discretion and when deemed necessary in the interest of national security, suspend any civilian officer or employee of the respectively named departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.957" offset="13283788">And then, it goes on to provide a procedure for the protection of the employee following his suspension and prior to his termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.727" offset="13334883">The employee is given a statement of the charges with the reasons to the extent that security considerations permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.082" offset="13376261">He is afforded 30 days within which to answer the charges and submit affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.662" offset="13406563">He is offered a hearing before an agency board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.403" offset="13429551">Following that hearing, his case is then reviewed by either the head of the department or someone to whom he has delegated that task.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.872" offset="13475422">And, finally, the head of the department himself makes the final determination as to whether the termination of that employee is, in the opinion of the agency -- agency head, necessary or advisable in the interest of the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.888" offset="13575523">As the Court will have observed in this case, petitioner declined his opportunity for agency hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.842" offset="13603318">So, there is in the record and there can be no questions as to what information he might have received had he availed himself of the tendered opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.727" offset="13650860">Now, it seems to us that, as to 11 named agencies specified in the Act itself, there can be no doubt that the Act applies, as it says, to any civilian officer and employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.525" offset="13726093">In other words, as to those 11 agencies, there is no employee, how ever high in hierarchy or how ever low, whom the agency head may not investigate and consider whether or not that person's service is detrimental to the security interests of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3738.663" offset="14954580">And the answer of the spokesman for the Department of Defense, which was the sponsor of this bill, was that you could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.760" offset="14990942">But, I think the better way is to leave it to the President's discretion because, at varying times, the compelling interest of the national security might be more intense at one period than another and rather than, as I say, imposing this requirement throughout the entire executive branch as a matter of permanent legislation, which this is, Congress deemed it more appropriate to vest in the President, what in our view is, the complete discretion to decide, at any time, which other agencies of the Government shall be subject to the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3870.543" offset="15482149">And, in the legislative history of this Act, it was recognized that, while the Department of Defense -- its present intention was to continue to process the loyalty cases under Executive Order 9835 as long as the President might choose to leave that order in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.045" offset="15576085">That if 9835 were to be terminated, then loyalty cases would be processed under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.900" offset="15615582">And since, as I have said, obviously, the loyalty case concept extends through the entire range of a Government agency and it was recognized that this statute could be used for that purpose.</text>
