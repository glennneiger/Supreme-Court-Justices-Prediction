            <text syncTime="16.505" offset="65933">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.063" offset="76173">Yesterday, we we're discussing the question whether or not, the decision of this Court, one way or the other, might resolve and one or more of the Senators, having been mislead as a result of what occurred on the Senate when the Portal Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.040" offset="168124">I think that if the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is affirmed, no Senator can fairly be said to have been mislead.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.254" offset="233012">I will explain the basis for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.547" offset="246178">I base it in part upon the statement in the Senate Report, which is so heavily relied upon by counsel for the Government in which we have quoted at page 18 of our brief in which, the report, upon which the Senate acted specifically said that the purpose of the Act was to make noncompensable activities and I quote, “Such as the preliminary activities which were involved in the Mt. Clemens case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="108.201" offset="432797">It seems to me that that's most significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.807" offset="451187">The very kind of activities with which this Court is concerned in this case were involved in the Mt. Clemens case, tool sharpening occurring preliminary to the regular work and in its formal document upon which it acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.310" offset="533211">The Senate specifically said that it intended by this Act to make those activities non-compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.535" offset="574067">And I think that that is far more persuasive if we are to go into the legislative history than casual remarks made by any of the senators on --</text>

            <text syncTime="162.251" offset="648986">Yes, it's a -- it -- that appears to me to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.751" offset="666958">It's -- the activities are to be made non-compensable, which are either alike or similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.730" offset="698828">It's even broader, I would say, Mr. Justice Black, than the same as.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.534" offset="722129">It certainly includes those activities and any others that are like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.790" offset="755148">And I think this shows that the line is certainly not to be drawn at some point, farther than the line that was drawn in the Mt. Clemens case, which is what the Government is really contending in this case.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="209.938" offset="839680">Well, Mr. Johnston, what do you do with the language of the report as quoted starting at the bottom of page 13 and following over on 14 in the -- in the Government's brief?</text>

            <label>Mr. Willard S. Johnston</label>
            <text syncTime="224.315" offset="897254">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.693" offset="906762">There, at the bottom of page 13, the Senate Report emphasizes that the term “principal activity” includes activities, which are an integral part of the principal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.655" offset="962560">Now, we agree with that, take no issue with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.324" offset="977293">The Ninth Circuit took no issue with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.081" offset="988264">But what the Government is doing and what I think Senator Cooper did was to, in -- in the debates but it's not in the report, I believe, use the word "indispensable” as synonymous with the word "integral.”</text>
            <text syncTime="263.566" offset="1054198">They mean -- they're two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.400" offset="1061512">Certainly, they're overlapping, but they don't mean the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.142" offset="1076558">Something that's integral is -- is a part of the principal activity, something that's integral to the principal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.014" offset="1108010">But many things may be indispensable to the principal activity and yet not be a part of it, not be integral to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.848" offset="1143327">For example, it was indispensable that I come from San Francisco to Washington and make this argument, but that trip, that travel, was no part of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.175" offset="1188676">There's a clear, obvious distinction between integral and indispensable not going on.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="302.847" offset="1211350">But the -- but the statement of that just a moment, the -- the brief of the Government says the Senate Report accompanying the Portal-to-Portal Act declared that, “the term principal activities, activity or activities includes all activities which are integral part thereof.”</text>
            <text syncTime="326.629" offset="1306436">And then, it says, “The Report then provides two specific examples of what is intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.507" offset="1334021">One, in connection with the operation of a lathe, an employee will frequently, at the commencement of his workday, oil, grease or clean his machine or install a new cutting tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.152" offset="1392536">Such activities are an integral part of the principal activity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="353.085" offset="1412284">Now, how do you distinguish installing a new cutting tool from sharpening their knives with that --</text>

            <text syncTime="420.232" offset="1680927">But you can't say that -- that the knifemen in our case are -- are employed to 10 knives in the sense that the lathe operator was employed to attend the machine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.193" offset="4512705">Well, on an adequate factual showing, this Court held that we didn't have the kind of a principal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.261" offset="4553038">They held that there were things that -- that made this activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1158.016" offset="4632033">In other words, the Court found that this knife sharpening was not done under the supervision of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.041" offset="4664111">It found that the parties over a period of 20 years had treated it as a non-compensable and that this was reflected and a collected bargaining agreement made between the employer and the large labor organization representing the employees, the amount made by meat cutters and butchers, workmen of North America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.745" offset="4738926">This was the reality of the industrial situation which Ms. Margolin spoke of yesterday and she referred to the administrator's own report in which he said, “We must construe this Act in the light of the realities of the industrial situation and the agreements of the parties where all the realities here certainly requires that there'll be a holding of non-compensability, because those realities are, that here, we're dealing with something that isn't supervised by the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.093" offset="5400346">And I believe that the legislative history that I reviewed yesterday from Senator Cooper demonstrated beyond doubt that that was not his intent and he drafted the provision.</text>

            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="1368.153" offset="5472549">Well, the Subcommittee, the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee drafted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.592" offset="5494282">It was composed of Senators Donnell, Wiley, and Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.586" offset="5514344">And Senator Donnell, we do not quote his statements in the legislative history, I mean in the -- in our brief, but his statement corroborates Senator Cooper's views of -- of what was intended by principal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.032" offset="5588114">The legislative history is variable eminently, and I think even without reading the report to the legislative history and just looking at the succession of bills that the Senate Judiciary Committee considered that it will be apparent that the principle activities was deliberately selected, instead of the scheduled or contract work -- workday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.876" offset="5687484">Because in the bill, which went to hearing, Senate Bill 70, in the bill, which went to hearing, precisely what Mr. Johnston is urging here was provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.306" offset="5737221">That is the preliminary and postliminary activities were tied in with the scheduled workday, with the contract workday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.246" offset="5776927">And Senator Donnell and I believe these two citations with the Court, if I may, because this confirmed Senator Cooper conclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.002" offset="5816007">Senator Donnell was explaining what happened to Senate while that provision was abandoned and principle activities was -- was adopted, and he explained that some of the amalgamated clothing company representatives and Mr. (Inaudible) who's somewhat of an authority on this Act, he was very active in -- in its original enactment and was advising Senator Donnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.702" offset="5938782">He said, “Mr. (Inaudible) and these union representatives had come to him and -- and criticized that definition of making it dependent on this contract work -- workday.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.840" offset="5995311">He had told him that that would operate to -- particularly to the disadvantage of unorganized workers because it would permit the employer to write his own ticket as to when he would let the workday start and end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.504" offset="6053930">That it was particularly to the disadvantage of unorganized workers and workers within -- in relatively weak union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.713" offset="6090815">And he said, “For that reason, for that reason, if seven day was resubmitted and then -- and then they came out with, for the first time, with a bill principle activities in it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.723" offset="6146821">Now, I say that that fully corroborate Senator Cooper's view of what they intended by -- by a principle activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.672" offset="6182661">And by the way, it's principle activity and activities in the plural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.394" offset="6201574">So, in answer to Justice Frankfurter's comment, I think something was meant by that plural, and the integral part of the principle activity was intended to be covered in that plural term activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1585.311" offset="6341172">It's not indispensable as Mr. Johnston, what have you think, simply because as just as running to work putting on clothes is indispensible to go into any job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.321" offset="6385267">Obviously, this is indispensible in -- in the sense that it's peculiarly related to this type of meat-to-meat cutting work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.652" offset="6418599">Just as the clothes wash, the clothes changing, and the washing and the chemical battery plant -- plant is just not ordinarily, just not putting on clothes for an ordinary work, but because it is required, necessitated by the peculiar hazardous character of that specific kind of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.961" offset="6495817">Now, that's the type of integral principle activity, which Senator Cooper was obviously referring to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.219" offset="6740846">Now, we admit that the putting on the apron, the checking in, checking -- punching the clock and -- and walking to the work bench, we admit that those are the incidental preliminary type of activities that were intended, but this didn't say all of the activities mentioned in -- in -- practically mentioned in -- in Mt. Clemens.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.149" offset="6840529">Now, what I say about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.918" offset="6847634">It says such as and it doesn't say all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.355" offset="6857352">What I say about that is that Senator Cooper made it perfectly clear in his colloquies with the Congress, with the other Senators that -- that they didn't intend to include all such things because some of the very example, to sharpening and some of the very examples mentioned in Mt. Clemens was specifically put to Senator Cooper and he said, “We're not intending to -- to remove all of those from compensation of that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.932" offset="6967693">I would like to close with one, with Senator Cooper's summary of what they intended to deal, which I think, Mr. Justice Harlan, shows pretty clearly that he wasn't saying that all Mt. Clemens' activities were to be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.507" offset="7025998">He says, “In summarizing the provisions of the Committee built for the future, I would like to say again, that in the period for the scheduled workday, the Committee did not legislate, and in that period, every right which the worker has secured under the Fair Labor Standards Act is preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.291" offset="7085140">And second, second, in addition to that, in our concept, in the term principal activity, we believe it's sufficiently broad to embrace within its terms such activities that are indispensable to the performance of productive work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.287" offset="7145117">Third, we have clearly eliminated walking, traveling, riding, and other activities, which are not an integral part of the employment for which the work is employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.008" offset="7180016">And I shall repeat that instead of legislating against the Fair Labor Standards Act, instead of attempting to destroy it, this is the first legislation, which confirms the interpretations, which have been given by the wage and hour administrative prior to this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.785" offset="7247099">We have simply setout standards and criteria.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.822" offset="7259220">Now, what he was saying there is except for those few things as to the future, except for the walking, riding, and traveling, and the other incidental things not a part of integral -- not an integral part of principal activity, they were confronting the previous administrative interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.360" offset="7329437">Now, this was tocompromise with the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.689" offset="7342707">The Senate agreed that as far as to pass a cause of an emergency created by Mt. Clemens, they agreed to the drastic remedy of -- of denying liability for all of those passed claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.143" offset="7392549">But for the future, for the future, they intended to preserve pretty much what had been held compensable prior to the Portal Act.</text>
