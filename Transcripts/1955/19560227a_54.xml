            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="1.670" offset="6583">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.936" offset="15673">This case is here on direct appeal to this Court from the District Court in the Southern District of Illinois under the Criminal Appeal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.400" offset="49528">Under that section of the Criminal Appeals Act which provides for a direct review here of a decision of a District Court arresting and judgment of conviction for insufficiency of indictment, where the decision of the District Court rest upon the construction for the validity of the statute upon which the indictment is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.958" offset="135732">The statute, upon which the indictment in this case has found it, is the Hobbs Act which was passed by Congress in July 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.385" offset="169482">And in general it prohibits and punishes extortion and robbery affecting interstate commerce, accomplished by force and violence and wrongfully induced fear.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.588" offset="222250">The facts of the case on the record which is before this Court are not complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.029" offset="240013">An indictment was brought forth by the grand jury in nine counts against two appellees, Jack Green and Local 397 of labor's union.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.525" offset="294034">We are concerned here with only the first two of those accounts because the District Attorney elected to go forward only on four counts and the jury acquitted on two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.929" offset="331651">Now, the counts upon which we are -- with which we're concerned her are accounts one and two appearing at the very beginning of the record, pages one and two.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.280" offset="369058">And what they charge is, that these two defendants violated the Hobbs Act by attempting to extort and by force and violence attempted an actual force and violence and fear.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.808" offset="415138">Attempted to extort from Government contractors engaged in work affecting interstate commerce, property of these Government contractors in the form of wages for imposed, fictitious, superfluous and unnecessary labor -- labor of person's called “swampers”, common laborers called “swampers” who were -- according to the indictment to be employed in connection with equipment being operated by the contractors on these Government projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.148" offset="544496">Swampers, I understand, are supernumeraries, common laborers who are sometimes employed in connection with heavy equipment, most generally for going ahead of the equipment to tell the operator of the equipment whether there are holes which he ought to avoid, and also, to take out branches, twigs and other obstacles which are on his way.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.619" offset="626416">Now the -- as I have said, there was an actual trial on this case that lasted for about 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.994" offset="651912">The District Attorney elected to go forward only on four charges, counts of the indictment, the jury convicted only on the first two.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.498" offset="685976">After the conviction, the defendants made a motion for an arrest of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.269" offset="704993">They also made a motion for a new trial and a motion for a judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.071" offset="724219">Now, the motion for a judgment of acquittal was denied by the District Judge and the motion for a new trial was denied by the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.255" offset="752953">And the motion for arrest of judgment was granted on two grounds only and the first ground was that the Hobbs Act did not cover the -- a crime which was charged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.558" offset="802168">And the second ground was that if it did, if the Hobbs Act did cover that -- that type of crime, then the statute was -- would probably be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.581" offset="854309">And I stressed, that the District Judge denied the motion in respect to other grounds which the appellees had raised below and he also denied a motion for judgment of acquittal and for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.751" offset="898926">And so, the cases here under the criminal --</text>

            <text syncTime="226.223" offset="904882">Do you consider there's any ambiguity in the record at all, as to whether he went on the indictment only or whether it was a sort of a combination of indictment evidence?</text>

            <text syncTime="242.429" offset="969665">Because at the very beginning when the Government filed this notice to appeal and jurisdictional statement, a motion to dismiss was made which the Court denied implicitly by noting probable jurisdiction, and the Court did not ask for discussion of its jurisdiction further.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.247" offset="1028911">And so, of course --</text>

            <text syncTime="291.058" offset="1164225">He -- on page 15 of the opinion of the District Judge, Mr. Justice Black, the third full paragraph, the District Judge says, "When the motion to dismiss the indictment was made in the beginning, the defendant's didn't argue very strongly that the statute didn't cover this particular crime or the allegations of the indictment."</text>
            <text syncTime="311.572" offset="1246250">So, he didn't consider it very fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.411" offset="1253564">So, now after the trial they renew that contention and he has looked at the indictment and he has looked at the statute and the legislative history, and he has come to the conclusion that Congress did not intend to make what the indictment charges a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.434" offset="1305704">Now, those -- that we think is pretty clear indication that what he was doing was looking only at the allegations of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.921" offset="1343634">For your information, Mr. Justice Black, the Government has in its statement as to jurisdiction and particularly in its brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss discussed that -- that issue much more fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.755" offset="1399014">And also, in a memorandum which is filed in opposition to the cross designation by the appellees, the appellees designated the entire trial record and the Government moved to strike that designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.331" offset="1453244">In that connection, we filed this mimeographed document which also contains our answer to the -- to the statement that the District Judge did more than merely construe the statute, which is what the Criminal Appeals Act deals with and so far as direct appeal is concerned, and that he construed the indictment or that he rested upon the evidence which was before him.</text>

            <text syncTime="452.567" offset="1810181">But we have not briefed it because we thought that the issue was resolved in this Court by the -- in this very case, by the denial of the motion to dismiss and by the granting of the Government's motion to strike the cross designation by the appellees of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.835" offset="2595318">The Government thinks that its position that the Hobbs Act does cover this crime is supported both by the words of the statute and overwhelmingly by the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.055" offset="2676193">If you just read the words of the statute and compare them with the words of the indictment, we would think that -- that there is nothing in the indictment which is not covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.012" offset="2716003">The statute begins by saying whoever -- whoever abstracts, delays, and so forth and the word "whoever" is a very broad word showing that the reach which Congress intended for this kind of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.600" offset="2766367">And particularly, it can cover a labor union.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.434" offset="2957688">And that is exactly what the statute -- what the indictment charges here that the defendants attempted to obtain the property from another in a form of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.878" offset="2999484">Now, wages are property and therefore that element of the statute is fulfilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.442" offset="3021740">And the second element is, wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence or fear or under color of official right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.301" offset="6681182">In the next paragraph, it seems in -- on page 16 after he cites the two cases in this Court which as he construe the indictment would make the employment of these swampers to be perfectly legal because they were actually gonna do the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.030" offset="6740114">Then he says, it seems incongruous that Congress intended a lawful action on the part of Green in demanding money in the form of wages from the contractor to being paid, for imposed unwanted, and fictitious services of laborers accompanied by either threats of force and violence, which under state law accounted only misdemeanors can be punished as a severe felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.743" offset="6814929">He is looking simply we think at the -- at the indictment as he construes it and he construes the indictment to provide that -- that what they were doing would be lawful if the force and violence perhaps and we agree to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.018" offset="10467997">That means force and violence which produces that result as well as having an intention in the part of a -- upon the part of the robber or of the -- the extorter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.428" offset="10525675">I want to go over the Act in this case because the construction of this law, it seems to me, is essential orderly from -- not only, and I am very pleased here, Mr. Davis says that he would like to submit it, a form of congressional record of what the purpose of the Act was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.514" offset="10594011">In the Copeland Act and the Hobbs Act of 1946 was enacted because the provision in the Copeland Act set -- that it modify in all situations although there has been in effect robbery and the extortion because while those terms were not used in the Copeland Act and were embodied in both the original Hobbs Act of 1946 and the codification of 1948 had nevertheless, that was the purpose that was had in mind that from the very time that that statute was enacted, first enacted it was known as the Anti-Racketeering or labeled in the Code or was the Racketeering Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.755" offset="10750955">That is all that have been always been carried along both as to the Hobbs Act for resuming as to the codification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.001" offset="10783974">For the first time in the Act of 1946, the Hobbs Act, the first one before the codification modified it a little but not in substance, the terms robbery were specifically mentioned and extortion also was specifically mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.387" offset="10861505">Primarily, we're talking about interference from Congress, I mean commerce, interference with commerce was not to be confused with crimes merely --crimes which are interference are one thing but the regulation of commerce primarily is a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.481" offset="10949904">It is not that denouncement of a felonious charge against anyone and it has been so treated and treated many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.205" offset="10996820">Now, Copeland in 1934, the Hobbs in April, as I remember of 1946, the Lea or Petrillo Act in June of 1946, the Taft-Hartley Act the next year and the legislative history is pretty interesting in those connections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.660" offset="11082606">The Taft -- Senator Taft said that the had that reframed because they're awaiting for a decision of this Court, the validity of the Lea Act where the finding was different and that Act was held on -- it was held constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.998" offset="11191902">Now, I think without question in my mind that Congress has the power if it desires and as defined because there are no common law definitions of crime in the federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.420" offset="11241639">If it defines robbery with an intent and this order is implicit in robbery and in extortion upon the part of the robber or the extorter to take from one by force and threats his property, money or whatever it is, it's personal of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.766" offset="11327007">And that those threats shall compel him or induce him both on contempt and the (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.946" offset="11371729">Now, if Congress passes such a law then of course, I think it is within the power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.064" offset="11404225">That was not what Justice Adair had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.305" offset="11417182">Judge Adair had in mind that under the indictment in this case where although the word "extortion" is used the facts that are charged as the basis upon which that extortion charge rest is nothing but featherbedding and those words that are used in this statute amounts to nothing except the things defined in the Lea or the Petrillo Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.206" offset="11540793">Now, that decision in the Lea or Petrillo Act was passed, I think, as I remember about in 1900 -- no, these were the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.503" offset="11613936">I -- I don't remember just the date of the Lea of Petrillo Act and that's merely because I'm getting too old, I have a good memory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.925" offset="11643611">But prior to the opinion which was handed down by this Court in that case, Judge Taft said that there were some doubt about validity and that the matter was before the Court and they thought they would abstain the -- not do anything further about the Petrillo or the Lea case until that decision was handed down and they never have done anything since.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.692" offset="11750713">Now, it does not seem to me to be sensible or reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.385" offset="11773492">One, that where it works, a robbery and extortion that have always been felonious clients, they're not regulatory things would a definition that even the stupidness, federal knows which are faced and premised upon first an intent to commit robbery upon the part of the robber or upon the part of the extorter, and they're so close kinship between Kick -- the Kickback Act and the blackmailing principle that they're all involved in that larceny thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.565" offset="11934198">They are all implicitly included for the benefit of the robber or the extorter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.448" offset="11965753">They're not doing it in many humane ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.689" offset="11978710">There isn't anything about it that's charitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.383" offset="11989473">It's a selfish, stupid, rotten thing from its very inception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.756" offset="12018939">Now, if it were the intention of the makers of the Hobbs Act of Congress when they passed that Act at the time within two months and a half afterwards when they passed the Lea Act to have said that featherbedding was to be included in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.079" offset="12120294">Why didn't say so?</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.180" offset="12132624">They did pass the Lea Act after the decision of this Court holding that it was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.259" offset="12160940">They did nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.953" offset="12171807">Now, in featherbedding as the most prevalent thing in the world generally in the labor union, then it would be one of those things that ought to be definitely designated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.159" offset="12212558">Judge Adair's opinion was, in my judgment when he said withhold -- to hold so that this -- that this indictment was a sufficient indictment under the Hobbs Act would be to extend the jurisdiction of this Court beyond my constitutional limits and the jurisdiction of Congress beyond its powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.452" offset="12313704">Now, what does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.212" offset="12320810">It means just what the Fifth and the Sixth Amendments of the Constitution were adopted for that person's charge would a felonious crime, those are the infamous crimes, shall be specifically informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.919" offset="12395624">It is not essential that that be done by a bill of particulars and there is nothing in this indictment that complies in my opinion with the apparent obligation of the pleader and the preparation of an indictment which is set out from a perspective of the entire Hobbs Act and of course that's what the Court always does in construing a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.618" offset="12510459">Now, just one other thought that I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.544" offset="12526132">I don't keep time very well and I presume that it could buzz the lights when I'm nearly through.</text>

            <text syncTime="3383.639" offset="13534459">That's the inherent thing in both of those crimes and there is not a single conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.446" offset="13549714">Under the old Copeland Act or under the Hobbs Act where that is not the facts, we go back to the old companion case in which a $1,100,000 was gotten by a buyout from the motion picture industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.680" offset="13638635">And every other case that's cited by the Government or found by us is a case in which personal moneys for the fellow who was the extorter in every instance were kept and those amounts run from small amounts like $7500 to $50,000 to $1,100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.010" offset="13720033">That's the purpose of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.382" offset="13733512">Justice Byrnes said in this majority decision in the 807 case in replying to an objection of the Government that the objection of the Government in this case has this true significance that it places an added burden upon the prosecutor rather than upon the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.593" offset="13826299">That is the prosecutor must first establish a criminal intent upon the part of the defendant and he must then make the further showing with respect to the victim's state of mind, he must through that intent and the accomplishment of the fear, fact of this rule is to run through a conviction of robbery more rather than less difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.521" offset="13922011">Now, Chief Justice Stone would dissent it clarifies that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.283" offset="13965061">You said the robbers forced and is intended effect upon the victim are essential elements of the crime both of which the prosecutor must prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.161" offset="14020545">Jury was told that convict -- it must plan -- this is a conspiracy case, find conspiracy or agreement where respondents violate the statute and that they must have -- must have the purpose or intention to commit the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.098" offset="14080313">As I have said, the intention to commit the crime, commit the offense includes the intention, to use force and violence on the -- the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.129" offset="14124513">Now, in view of the history in the long known thing which in the Taft-Hartley Act designates featherbedding as an unfair labor practice in which in the Lea Act is made a misdemeanor and in the opinion in that case called a regulatory law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.426" offset="14209672">How then can it be said that the persons bringing and any members of the union, and they just included as the union could have had any such intent, as that's implicit and as the term "robbery" as defined by the statute itself and the term "extortion" which must of course does include because it's a basic part of the old larceny law, the same necessary essentials that is important in the definition of this felonious crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.576" offset="14354286">It seems to me that to say that these people had such an intention in this case is to read into the things which the Court's opinion showed should not and do not belong to that.</text>
