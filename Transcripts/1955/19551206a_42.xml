            <text syncTime="198.876" offset="795481">It's always been the rule of this Court until formalized by Rule 51, as far as I have been able to ascertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.778" offset="831112">Now then, the first case, there are only two cases of this Court that bear directly on the point here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.620" offset="854413">In other words, that are directly on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.115" offset="864444">The first case is Beaver versus Taylor in 93 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.438" offset="881685">In that case, the complaining party submitted eight requested instructions of the trial court, and the trial court refused them.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.159" offset="912614">He made a bear objection to the Court's refusal to give his eight requested instructions, just said he objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.346" offset="941349">He also then accepted to the charge in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.850" offset="955350">He accepted to the charge, to so much of the charge of the Court as given, as was in conflict with, and variant from the several propositions presented by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.685" offset="1002684">On appeal, this Court held as it's already been suggested yesterday by Mr. Justice Minton that the entire series was presented as one request.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.128" offset="1056496">And if anyone proposition was unsound, an exception to a refusal to charge the series cannot be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.700" offset="1086798">All of the propositions presented were not sound, notably the fifth request should not have been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.294" offset="1113130">In this case, the instant case, the court below held that 15 of the requested instructions were -- were properly refused by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.543" offset="1150119">In addition, this Court said in the Beaver versus Taylor case, one object of an exception is to call the attention of the Circuit Judge to a precise point as to which it is supposed to be at error.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.794" offset="1203096">And he may then there consider it and give a new and different instruction to the jury if in his judgment, it should be proper to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.887" offset="1235487">An exception on the form we're considering, entirely defeats that object.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.318" offset="1257221">Now, the second case is Jones versus East Tennessee Railway Company, which is a case of 157 U.S.cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.546" offset="1290136">In that case, there was a request for six instructions and the Court gave two of them and denied the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.680" offset="1318661">And then a bill of exceptions, the complaining party, merely accepted the Court's refusal to give its requested instructions as in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.247" offset="1352934">And this Court, citing the Beaver versus Taylor case said, “This exception was insufficient.”</text>
            <text syncTime="347.926" offset="1391700">Now, then, those were the only two cases dealing with refusal of the trial court to give requested instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.068" offset="1420225">There are a number of cases by this Court which had to do with the taking of exceptions and making objections to the charge actually given.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.304" offset="1457215">And to summarize what the Court has said rather than go into each of these cases, it appears from a study of the previous opinions of this Court enacted before Rule 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.265" offset="1504967">I mean --</text>

            <text syncTime="394.295" offset="1577169">In summary of the position, that this Court has taken and with respect to the rule before its actual promulgation as Rule 51, it appears first.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.638" offset="1614472">That in situations where no objection whatever is made to the charge or to failure give requested instructions, it's held that the complaint will not be considered on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.629" offset="1658462">Secondly, where there is an objection made to the charge given, or to the Court's failure to give a requested charge, that likewise, the complaint will not be considered because you haven't pointed out distinctly to the judge what the ground of the complaint is.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.297" offset="1729097">And finally, there is a case of this Court that holds that after the jury has retired it's too late to make any objection whatsoever to any and either one of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.995" offset="1779879">Now, there is one other case which I will discuss at more length later.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.011" offset="2304000">It's an important rule because it's likely to have application in every jury trial in the District Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.116" offset="2592392">The real question that would be troubling the judge, in that kind of a case, is not whether or not, as an abstract point of law, the instruction is legally correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.557" offset="2630217">It's a question of, whether or not, the evidence justifies the giving of the instruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.550" offset="5382165">Now then, let's consider how Rule 51's been -- been treated by the Courts of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.197" offset="5424692">There are 14 cases that we've discovered where there was no objection made to the refusal of the trial court to give requested instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.486" offset="5461891">And in those -- those instances, the appellate court applied Rule 51 and said, they wouldn't consider, whether or not, the instruction should or should not have been given in the absence of a proper objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.565" offset="5514240">In 70 cases, there was no objection made at all to the Court's charge actually given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.608" offset="5550393">And on those cases, the courts below held Rule 51 applied and they wouldn't consider the propriety of the instructions actually given in absence of a proper objection under Rule 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.170" offset="5596578">There are four cases in which -- which are in point with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.830" offset="5619252">Where a bare objection just said, “I object to the Court's failure to give requested instructions occurred, and no grounds of the objection were stated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.115" offset="5660421">And it was held that Rule 51 precluded the consideration of that complaint or those complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.700" offset="5686753">And likewise, in 24 cases, where there was just a bare objection with the Court's charge as being erroneous, but without any grounds pointing out to the judge wherein the judge erred, it was held that Rule 51 applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.504" offset="5741923">Now, that's 112 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.154" offset="5748611">And there's been a couple of since then, in which Rule 51 has been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.251" offset="5768986">Now, in contrast to that, we have a -- a few cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.772" offset="5791033">And there are very few where these loopholes had been found in Rule 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.472" offset="5825829">And the rule, in effect, actually evade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.647" offset="5838576">The first is, one Court held that where a charge is self-explanatory on its face that it automatically constituted the requested charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.335" offset="5877238">And likewise, an automatic objection of the failure of the trial court to give that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.618" offset="5902420">Secondly, it's been held by some of the courts that there's even an erroneous requested and charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.596" offset="5926348">That the Court, if the erroneous charge is somewhat self-explanatory, that it, nevertheless, constitutes an -- an objection to the charge actually given or in itself requires the trial judge to search around and give a proper instruction upon the same subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.828" offset="5991236">Third, there's the idea that Rule 46 and 51 should be construed together, and that merely handing the trial judge your written requested instructions makes known to him the action which you desire the Court to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.928" offset="6047660">And under Rule 46, automatically preserves an objection on appeal, the effect of which is to utterly nullify Rule 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.965" offset="6083814">And finally, there is the theory advanced by some of the cases, that the Court on -- or the appellate courts have an inherent power in an extraordinary case to consider the matter of instructions even in the absence of a proper objection under Rule 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.304" offset="6145149">Now then, these points are well exemplified in the two cases cited by the Court of Appeals below in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.804" offset="6179213">They didn't discuss Rule 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.080" offset="6188304">They merely denied the motion for a -- a petition for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.987" offset="6203873">And in a footnote, cited two cases without comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.504" offset="6221949">The first of these was a prior decision of the Fifth Circuit itself, Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company versus 2603.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.491" offset="6257894">Now, in that case, it appeared that the defendant made only this objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.672" offset="6290599">He said defendant accepts to the failure of the Court to charge defendants requested charge Number 6, which is about the same thing that happened in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.302" offset="6341172">And for charging Numbers 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14 of the plaintiff's special requested charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.575" offset="6374296">In other words, he objected to the failure of the Court to give his requested instruction and objected to the Court's charge as actually given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.134" offset="6408464">The Court first noted and this appeared to be an insufficient objection under Rule 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.919" offset="6427585">But then it said this, "We think in view the full statement of the defendants requested instruction Number 6, which had been presented to the Court that these objections sufficiently complied with the requirements of Rule 51."</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.493" offset="6493936">In other words, the requested instruction, on its face, was so clear that the Court had constituted a requested instruction and an automatic objection for the failure of the trial court to give it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1725.055" offset="6900193">That was an interesting case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.343" offset="6917329">What occurred there was, the plaintiff woman, a passenger on an interstate bus, mounted the bus with heavy luggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.199" offset="6944705">She took it back to her sit and tried to put it up on the top rack above her head over the objections of the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.828" offset="6983262">She rode along for a while and the thing finally fell off on her head and injured her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.838" offset="7003324">Fairly clear case of contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.701" offset="7014713">There was a regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission which provided that interstate carriers have to so stow baggage that it won't fall off and hurt the passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.451" offset="7053793">The plaintiff requested an instruction along that line, but apparently, it was so inaptly drawn that it was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.245" offset="7084931">The trial court refused to give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.187" offset="7092663">And there was no exception taken either to the charge or to the failure to give the requested instruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.429" offset="7145639">Yet, whereas here, after conceding that the requested instructions was erroneous, yet, whereas here, the meaning of the request is reasonably apparent, and that subject matter is important and not sufficiently covered by the general charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.619" offset="7198407">A court would not be justified in ignoring the request merely because it's susceptible to such interpretation as to make its proposition not absolutely accurate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.651" offset="10182531">There was -- there was a request to instructions to the effect of whether or not, the plaintiff on the occasion and question failed to exercise ordinary care in attempting a landing with his wing flaps up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.300" offset="10225162">And that such failure was the approximate cause of the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.898" offset="10235507">And that if you find that your verdict should be to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.721" offset="10246792">Now, the Court instructed the jury, that one of the main issues that will be called upon to determine of whether or not Gibson's injuries, resulted from negligent reconditioning of the aircraft by Lockheed, or whether due to poor or improper flying of the plaintiff at the time of making a landing in Carswell field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.864" offset="10307396">He further instructed the jury that it was a contention of Lockheed that Gibson's injuries were due to the negligence of the plaintiff himself, in the manner of his flying, and attempted landing at Carswell field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.551" offset="10350132">In that he made no effort to estimate the proper and necessary speed to safely affect the landing in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.440" offset="10373747">And finally, the Court told the jury, that if it found from the evidence, that the crash resulted from Gibson's miscalculation of his landing approach that the plaintiff couldn't recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.568" offset="10418260">So I say it was amply covered by the instructions in addition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2868.548" offset="11474129">The petitioner urges upon this Honorable Court a construction of the rules of federal procedure that is rigid, inflexible, and undeviating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.757" offset="11539017">The respondent urges upon this Honorable Court a rule of construction that is in accord with the intent and purpose of the rule in order that justice might be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.825" offset="11619265">We do not consider that this rule is a trap for the unwary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.791" offset="11651135">We do not consider that that is the purpose of its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.723" offset="11678824">The language of the rule is clear, but the intent and purpose of the rule is equally, is clear.Many cases in the lower court have written decisions on the intent and purpose of Rule 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.731" offset="11762834">They all state the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.628" offset="11778508">The purpose of Rule 51 is to preclude assignment of error that were not fairly and timely called to the attention of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.667" offset="11846635">Now, this is a civil case of course, but with the indulgence of the Court I would say that it has some aspects of the criminal nature as far as I personally am concerned because we're not trying with my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.370" offset="11905463">The Fifth Circuit said that my client didn't get a fair trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2985.100" offset="11940362">And the argument of petitioner is, that I did not fairly and timely apprise the trial judge of the errors which I -- that might be in his charge or of the instructions that I wanted him to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.472" offset="12021864">The petitioner says that the rule is inflexible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.232" offset="12060839">No matter that your client did not get justice, no matter that your client did not get a fair trial, but if you get caught in that trap, then, your client has no further recourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.094" offset="12124369">Now, in urging upon this Honorable Court that they construe Rule 51 in accordance with its intention and purpose, at least I'm in good company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.743" offset="12178913">The intent and purpose of Rule 51 has been interpreted and written upon by the District of Columbia in the Virginia Stage case, in the Holland Tactics case, by the Second Circuit in Wright versus Farm Journal and the famous Sweeney v. United Kingdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.124" offset="12272431">In the Third -- Third Circuit in the case of Green versus Reddy, in the Fifth Circuit by the Case of Lumbermens versus Hutchins and the two Atlantic coastline cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.835" offset="12419239">What I'm saying that those Circuits have construed Rule 51 by looking to the intent and purpose of the rule and have not when it became before them and says, "Rule 51 says this, that's it, regardless of what may have happened at the trial."</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.775" offset="12495099">Now, here is what happened at this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.094" offset="12524356">If we are going to construe this rule in accordance with its intent and purpose, which is the argument that I'm attempting to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.917" offset="12659566">In the first place, there were two main defenses as is obvious from the reading of our pleadings and as Mr. Justice Frankfurter has pointed out.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.144" offset="12792477">And the Court refused at that time to strike it from the defendant's answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.367" offset="12817450">In the trial of the case, the evidence on contributory negligence in specific situations was testified too by many -- many witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="4420.024" offset="17680091">Now, that practice varies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.837" offset="17691272">Most plaintiff's attorney prepare the charge in the state courts because a lot of times it'd be out in a small district where a judge won't be expected to be an expert on some particular law that's brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.199" offset="17752712">And that many judges, however, won't allow either party to assist to be making their charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.525" offset="17777998">They want to do it themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.748" offset="17782909">So, it's not enough standard in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.112" offset="17796389">But I would say generally the -- the plaintiff's attorney assist the Court in the charge and the defendant's attorney requests an issue, but it's more or less what they use as a petition as the framework under what credit they take the petition which does allege specific acts of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.524" offset="17862008">And then the judge sees that the evidence raised it, why didn't he know that a special issue should be submitted on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.247" offset="17892937">And that's the way it does in many cases in the District Court in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.893" offset="17911536">The judge -- the federal judge submits the case on the special issues with no general charge whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.790" offset="17943092">In the Northern District of Texas, I would say that most workmen compensation cases are submitted that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.106" offset="17968379">They use practically the same system as in the state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4527.915" offset="18111634">It is the practice in the Fifth Circuit for requested instructions to be submitted to the trial judge in federal courts before the judge prepares his charge for his aid in assistance in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.483" offset="18173910">And it is also the custom at that time and the practice and was done in this case to submit copies to opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.891" offset="18207556">The requested instructions, in this case, bare the same date as the last day of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.052" offset="18236186">The trial judge advised this counsel and as to sometime during the trial of the case, he'll say, "I would like to have you -- the counsel's requested instructions by noon tomorrow," which means, of course, that that's the point where he's going to -- to prepare his charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.658" offset="18326570">And he wants the instructions there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.610" offset="18334407">And that was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.668" offset="18342661">And at the time that Judge Davidson prepared his charge, he had, with these -- all of these requested instructions with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.714" offset="18374844">And that -- that's obvious from the record because they were all signed by him and all noted and at the time that he gave his charge and then -- and then immediately call for objections, that there was further discussion between counsel for the plaintiff and counsel and -- and the trial judge which is very important in this case for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4621.674" offset="18486648">The -- the counsel for the petitioner was objecting to the fact that the judge was contributing too much on contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.630" offset="18534504">And the judge pointed out to him and it's in this record, "No, you misunderstood me.</text>

            <text syncTime="5208.771" offset="20835056">There -- there are some 120 decisions on Rule 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.898" offset="20859507">And if you look at the circumstances of the case, because I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter observed awhile ago, you will find that they are not in disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.508" offset="20921992">And I'd like to say this in reference to another question that was asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.462" offset="20941845">This rule comes from Supreme Court Rule 8, as near as I can find it, which was a rule that said you couldn't assign an objection to the charge unless the objection has pointed out the particularity of the error in the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.752" offset="21006942">And then when 51 was written, they added the part about requested instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.101" offset="21032333">And they said that's also true about requested instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.425" offset="21049678">Now, that point is important to my mind for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.855" offset="21063367">There is one group of cases that holds, if you make a blanket or formal exception to the charge, for instance, let's say that the judge charged at length on the doctrine of last clear chance and the lawyer got up, and when he's called for exception and then he says, "I -- I object to Your Honor's charge because there's an incorrect charge on last clear chance."</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.373" offset="21161482">There the -- a number of cases that hold that that kind of an objection to the charge as given that the blanket of exception is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.191" offset="21196696">And I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.334" offset="21201293">And I think that's right because that doesn't point out to the judge in what way the charge that he gave is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.210" offset="21236820">There is another group of cases in which there were exceptions requested of the Court and no exception was taken when the time came, when the trial court called for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5322.342" offset="21289273">That's the case of (Inaudible) by Blair versus Collins.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.189" offset="21304738">And there's a number of cases that hold that that is not confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.931" offset="21319680">And I have no quarrel with those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.579" offset="21334309">The third group of cases, is the one like the case here at bar, where there was requested instruction where the Court did know the point that counsel was making and understood it and an exception was taken to inform the judge that the point would be preserved for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.576" offset="21414243">Now, when you divide the cases into those three groups and it seems to me it's a -- it's a -- that you're not splitting hairs when you do that because there are three different situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.776" offset="21455099">When you divide them into those three groups, there's almost completely unanimity of opinion amongst the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.351" offset="21481326">And I think that the reason for that is apparently it's because the lower courts have had no trouble in discovering the intent and purpose of this rule and given of -- of that situation, you can apply the purpose of Rule 51 to it and judges don't, I don't think would ever disagree about it,.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.707" offset="21562828">The -- the -- when you divide them into those different groups, there's almost 98% accord in most all of the cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="6180.076" offset="24720300">And I only touch on it that -- to see the doctrine of volenti was relied on quite heavily by the defendant here, because we thought we had a perfect situation of it where the test pilot which was employed for that purpose gets in on the plane and gas fumes are noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6198.070" offset="24792189">And he says, "Well, I guess I could have taken the plane back and had it rechecked, but I decided to go on."</text>
            <text syncTime="6207.031" offset="24828029">And when he did, the plane crashed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.689" offset="24838687">And there's no question, absolutely, but whether it applies in Texas, absent the master servant relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="6217.460" offset="24869825">So, we pled it and we got all the testimony that we could.</text>
            <text syncTime="6222.007" offset="24888007">We requested instructions on it and the Court refused them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6226.444" offset="24905770">And the Fifth Circuit said that they didn't rule on whether it was applicable or not because they said our instructions were not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6235.785" offset="24943073">Well, there were two instructions on volenti and both of them had been copied out of the Supreme Court decisions word per word and that's where we made our mistake because by doing that, we got them below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6248.351" offset="24993332">It's too general for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6250.707" offset="25002736">And so, the Fifth Circuit said, "Well, they weren't correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6253.736" offset="25014857">So, we won't rule on them."</text>
            <text syncTime="6255.609" offset="25022380">But there are cases that I want to call the Court's attention to, Montgomery versus Virginia Stage Lines and Fuller versus King and others that have held that well, that is one of the main issues of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6267.270" offset="25068983">And I think that the doctrine of -- of volenti in this case certainly is one of the main issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6272.876" offset="25091448">That's one of the main issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6274.807" offset="25099180">That if an instruction is requested and although that instruction is not absolutely correct, if it's sufficient to call to the Court's attention, the doctrine you want, why then, if the Court is in error in not giving it, why it's reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="6289.317" offset="25157172">And Mr. Justice Minton, when he was -- in the Seventh Circuit, wrote an opinion in O'Donnell versus Elgin explaining just exactly advocating the doctrine that I'm advocating now and had done much better language than I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.125" offset="25224464">And we think that this case should be reverse and -- and we should be given an opportunity to go to the jury on the doctrine of volenti non fit injuria which would denied us in the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6320.011" offset="25279948">And although our instruction was not absolutely correct according to the Fifth Circuit, which is only meant but they said so, why it was sufficient, clearly to call the Court's attention to one of the main questions in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6334.024" offset="25336059">And therefore, we would like to bring that up.</text>
            <text syncTime="6337.497" offset="25349956">Now, in closing, I -- well, to borrow us some language from an abler counselor that I am which expresses, I think, very clearly the -- the doctrine of the rule of -- of construction that we're urging on this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.122" offset="25460402">And with the indulgence of Mr. Justice Black, I'd like to read this language from the case of Hormel versus Helvering, which is exactly the argument that I have so poorly attempted to make here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.308" offset="25517140">Rules of practice and procedure are devised to promote the ends of justice, not to defeat them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6390.342" offset="25561339">They are rigid and undeviating, judicially declared practice under which Court of Review would invariably and under all circumstances decline to consider all questions which had not previously been specifically urged would be out of harmony with this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6413.196" offset="25652767">Orderly rules of procedure do not require sacrifice of the rules of fundamental justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6425.086" offset="25700310">The Fifth Circuit has said that my client did not get a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6430.488" offset="25721940">And if this Court, this Honorable Court wishes to lay down some rule for the future guidance of lawyers practicing in this country, I submit that does not alter the fundamental justice of my client's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6448.746" offset="25794978">They did not get a fair trial and they are entitled to one and their attorney who made the mistake was following the plain rules of his own circuit, the plain decisions of the Fifth Circuit in his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6463.842" offset="25855269">And for that reason, we very respectfully urge the Court to affirm the decision of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6472.003" offset="25887974">Thank you.</text>
