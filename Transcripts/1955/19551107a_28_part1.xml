            <text syncTime="24.900" offset="99579">This case is here on a writ of certiorari granted by this Court to review the decision of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.819" offset="147226">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which reversed a judgment of the District Court solely as -- as to the factual issue of damages assessed by a jury, as reduced by the trial judge and remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial confined to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.693" offset="278674">The questions presented herein are important questions of law pertaining to federal appellate review, which are first does a federal appellate court have the power to review the inadequacy or excessiveness of a jury verdict in an action brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act where the damages are unliquidated, and not ascertainable with mathematical certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.426" offset="457665">Secondly, as an order of the District Judge refusing to grant a new trial pursuant to which a plaintiff remits a portion of the verdict subject to review by a federal appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.008" offset="540003">And we submit if the Court please, that before going questions include as fairly comprised therein in accordance with Rule 41 (d) (1) of the rules of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.088" offset="620251">The subsidiary question of whether the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in the instant case committed error in reviewing the factual issue of damages found by a jury as reduced by the trial judge, whether damages were unliquidated, not ascertainable with mathematical certainty and rested upon in absolute elements and where the petitioner pursuant to the order of the District Judge refusing a new trial remitted a portion of the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.010" offset="803944">The facts in this case briefly are these, the petitioner, as the administrator of the estate -- of his deceased son, William Neese, brought this action in the District Court of the United States for Eastern District of South Carolina under the Federal Employers' Liability Act to recover damages against the respondent company for his negligence in having provide petitioners interstate, son, age 22 years, a safe place to work as the result of which he was struck and killed by a train of the respondent Railroad Company, while engaged in its employee as a car inspector at its yards in Columbia, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.843" offset="1015327">The case was tried before the District Judge and a jury and resulted in a jury verdict in favor of the petitioner for the benefit of the parents, of the deceased son, who are the beneficiaries under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, in the sum of $60,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.282" offset="1113025">The damages assessed by the jury, as reduced by the trial judge, which under the Act is compensation for loss of reasonably expected pecuniary benefits, which will have resulted to the parents from the continued life of the deceased son and which damages were unliquidated and not ascertainable with mathematical certainty was supported by the record evidence of the earning capacity of the deceased, his habits or clear this and tendencies to provide for the support and maintenance of his parents, the amounts that the parents would have require for their support and maintenance, which amounts together with the son's services on the basis of his past (Inaudible) conduct, the parents could have reasonably expected from him as he not met his untimely death.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.616" offset="1362442">After the entry of judgment on the verdict, the respondent company filed a motion for judgment, non obstante veredicto or the alternative for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.831" offset="1423256">The District Judge refused the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto and having found that the damages were excessive but not the result of passion, prejudice or caprice and also refused to grant a new trial condition, however, upon the petitioner remitting $10,000 of the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.552" offset="1534119">This, the petitioner's dad and accordingly judgment for the reduced amount of $50,000 was duly entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.733" offset="1574870">Thereupon, the respondent company appealed to the court below, which on appeal affirmed as to the issue of liability, but after having to review the way and appraise the evidence as to the factual issue of damages upon which fair-minded men could disagree and reach different conclusions, the court below in its opinion concluded that the damage were excessive and not supported by the record and consequently reversed as to this -- as to the issue of damages and remanded the case for a new trial confined to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.996" offset="1791896">Adverting, if the Court please, to the questions presented for the determination of the Court, it is our contention that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in the instant case committed clear error in reviewing the factual issue of damages assessed by the jury, as reduced by the trial judge where the damages herein were unliquidated and rested upon in absolute elements and where the petitioner, pursuant to the order of the District Judge remitted a portion of the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.357" offset="1993352">We rest our contention, if Your Honors please, upon a well settled principles of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.390" offset="2045492">A principle of law firmly established by a long and non-broken line of decisions of this Court to the effect that a federal appellate court will not review the action of a trial judge in refusing or granting a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.748" offset="2130965">And this rule is applicable where the ground of the motion for a new trial is that the damages awarded by the jury were inadequate or accepted.</text>

            <text syncTime="721.208" offset="2884754">And we must remember that the safeguards of controlling the verdict of a jury which is excessive is placed in the District Judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.050" offset="2940134">And we must rely upon them for safeguarding the jury verdict or appraising the jury verdicts.</text>

            <text syncTime="789.772" offset="3159040">When we refer to the language of Mr. Justice Brandeis, he said in this in the Fairmount case.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.002" offset="3484003">And as Mr. Justice Clark said in Knauff versus Shaughnessy, that the word discretion means anything, it means that it must be exercised by the recipient of the power according to his own understanding and conscience.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.258" offset="7797029">He said any case, which presents a mere excess upon -- a mere excess upon the record or upon the evidence does not present a question for reexamination in this -- in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.983" offset="7879889">And in our case, the fact is so much stronger than those in the Bennett case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.911" offset="7915624">Here, we have a young boy, 22 years of age, who is here, he left surviving his parents, his earning capacity if he had lived at the time of the trial would have been $4300 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.109" offset="7988349">And with the prevailing yearly increases in wages amongst railway workers, the jury certainly had a right to infer that his wages would have been even more with increase seniority and experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.379" offset="8053447">The record also shows that the relationship between the boy and the parents was close.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.265" offset="8085002">He stayed at home, he live at home, did chores around the house with his parents and even offered to them, of course, during the time, there was nothing to eat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.657" offset="8130560">His full paycheck to do with them as they please and he made the expression or expressed himself that he would provide for his parents as long as they live.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.766" offset="8202971">We also had the evidence of record that the father was planning to retire and that he would need for his financial support upon his retirement, the sum of approximately $3300 per year exclusive of his independent income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.433" offset="8289698">Which amounts, we submit, upon the bases of the past statute in conduct of the deceased together with the son's services, the parents could have reasonably expected had he not met his untimely death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.824" offset="8371200">And computing the amount of damages mathematically according to standards, annuity tables and standard mortality tables, the present cash value of the future benefits that would have accrued to the parents exceeds $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.145" offset="8468480">And we submit that when -- that when the court below undertook to review, weigh and appraise the evidence and when it viewed the evidence in the like most favorable to the respondent company is that of in the like most favorable to the petitioner as it was required to do on appeal according to the prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.328" offset="8589270">And when he treated as mathematical certainties, the life expectancies of the parents, the ironic passage of the deceased, the safe rate of interest that money was earned and the amount of contributions that the son would have given to the parents without taking into consideration, the different status of the parents during the life of the deceased and their changed status wherein they would be in need of financial support upon the father's retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.772" offset="8731063">The trial judge or rather the Court of Appeals clearly invaded the province of the jury and clearly usurped the prerogative of the trial judge contrary to the firmest established principles of this Court and contrary to the expressed prohibition of the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.039" offset="8840150">And we submit on the basis of that evidence, on the basis of those facts upon the basis of the fact that the Court of Appeals waived the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.240" offset="8892918">It clearly constituted reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.426" offset="8921652">And moreover, we submit that when we consider that the petitioner in the instant case remitted a portion of the verdict pursuant to the order of the trial judge refusing a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.535" offset="8994064">It furnishes additional reasons based upon equitable considerations why a Federal Court should not be permitted to review the factual issue of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.986" offset="9055922">We say that it would hardly be fair to a plaintiff who remits a portion of the verdict pursuing to the order of a trial judge refusing a new trial on the basis that the error of excessiveness if any is cured thereby.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.713" offset="9142753">And for reasons of public policy and public convenience as stated by this Court in the old case of (Inaudible) cited in our brief appeals in matters of discretion should not be encouraged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.970" offset="9219866">And borrowing if I may from the language of Mr. Justice Douglas in Dickinson Industrial Site versus Cowan appeals in matters of discretion should not be allowed because to do so would encouraged an unseemly parade of litigants to the appellate courts and that to the time and expense of the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.335" offset="9337313">And as stated in 13 Federal Rules of Decisions, page 67 in an article in Federal Employers' Liability Act, the grounds of such appeals would be but prevalent and the purposes to delay the payment of merit and verdicts, the needy clients and thereby force upon them inadequate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.231" offset="9452878">Now if the Court please, adverting to the contentions of the respondent Railroad Company which is narrowed down on pages 23 and 24 of it's brief, we wish to call the Court's attention to the significant admission made by it that according to the weight of authority in the decisions from 1789 down to the decision in the Fairmount case in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.322" offset="9673247">The federal appellate court, the Court of Appeals in the instant case did not have the power to review the factual questions, which it reviewed in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.929" offset="9727687">This submission is made by respondent with two reservations upon which it relies for it's contention that a federal appellate court has the power now to review the factual issue for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.257" offset="9805009">Its first contention is that because the historical limitations of the writ of error was abolished and that having been a reason which it seeks to create the impression was the sole reason for the refusal to review the action of a trial judge in granting a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.613" offset="9902393">The rule itself has become obsolete and must disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.226" offset="9924859">The short answer to that contention, if the Court please, is simply this, and although one of the reasons for the refusal to review the action of a trial judge in refusing or granting a new trial was the historical limitation of the writ of error, another and more coaching and compelling reason was the expressed prohibition of the Seventh Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney S. Alderman</label>
            <text syncTime="3033.154" offset="12132519">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.105" offset="12156343">I do not think that this Court took this case on a certiorari to determine whether $50,000 should be paid by the respondent, the petitioner in this unfortunate case or whether in some lesser amount should be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.250" offset="12240980">There's a fix data in this case, all courts below held and nobody challenges that holding that a verdict of $60,000 on the facts in this case were the excess as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.807" offset="12315167">The trial judge stated that he would set aside the verdict unless the plaintiff would grant or file a remittitur in the amount of $10,000 refusing the jury verdict from $60,000 to $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.385" offset="12393535">The Court of Appeals and I take some exception to the statement of what the Court of Appeals held below, the Court of Appeals and the Circuit disclaimed that it was substituting it's judgment on any question of fact for the judgment of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.048" offset="12484127">It held and reversed the trial court in terms for an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.881" offset="12519445">Mr. Justice Reed mentioned a question about the mathematics, which indicates what the court below has said about the evidence in this case had been read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.235" offset="12580885">Without reading extensively from the decision of the court below, it showed from the record in the case that $50,000 put out prevailing rates of interest would have produced for the beneficiaries here more than the take home pay of this young man so long as he work for his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.142" offset="12712542">The Fourth Circuit does not make any habit of reviewing quantum of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.879" offset="12751412">In all of its latest series of cases, it has held that automatically, in any ordinary case, such question of excessiveness is exclusively a question for the District Court, the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.897" offset="12823510">And the only exception which it -- it makes is that in case of an abuse of discretion as where nothing in the record could reasonably justify that amount of a motion for a new trial, only in the case of what it cause, a very rare instance of abuse of discretion does it under to review that question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.037" offset="12956108">In that respect, the Fourth Circuit is in complete harmony with the Ninth Circuit and so far as I can read the cases, it's in complete harmony with what of all there the Circuit say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.471" offset="13017861">And the last point in my brief, you will find to be a complete review of the decisions of the different Circuits since Fairmont Glass Works case was decided by this Court in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.613" offset="13086407">There has been a complete shift in the authorities as declared by the Courts of Appeal since 1936 and not one of the Courts of Appeals as I read their decisions denies for a moment that it has power to review a trial court in a matter of this kind for abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.256" offset="13200927">The very question which was pre-committed by this Court in the Fairmount case in which Mr. Justice Brandies was so careful to pre-commit and not to decide for causing that case, the Court of Appeals had not even planned that the trial court had abused it's discretion and there was nothing in the record in the way of the statement by the trial court as to why he acted as he did.</text>
