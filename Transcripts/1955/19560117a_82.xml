            <label>Mr. John Lord O'Brian</label>
            <text syncTime="11.576" offset="46289">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.570" offset="54230">This case is here on direct appeal from the New York Court of Appeals jurisdiction having been noted by this Court last October.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.452" offset="97802">It involves a controversy between the appellants who were manufacturers of tractors and motor vehicles and the action of the State Tax Commission in levying what is called colloquially, the highway use tax of New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.984" offset="191843">The parties submitted their dispute by a stipulated case in accordance to the New York practice to the Appellate Division of the Third Department which -- which it decided against the -- the appellants and appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.934" offset="271673">The Court, the majority of the Court wrote no opinion but affirmed one Judge, Judge Van Voorhees, dissenting in an -- a short and very strong opinion which is part of the transcript of record before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.964" offset="339801">The -- if I may briefly state the facts instead of the question at law the furthest, I think I can make it relatively clear and also narrow the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.764" offset="403017">These appellants, I make no distinction between them, the International Harvester Company and the Brockway Company are the same both, what I I say for one applies to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.306" offset="461218">As the International Credit Company here, Harvester Credit Company, is merely the assignee of the rights of the Harvester Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.368" offset="497371">It's a -- it's a finance corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.180" offset="504686">It has nothing to do with the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.014" offset="520046">In the spring of 1953, the -- these two companies sold to the Eastern Carting Company three tractors, International sold two and Brockway one.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.059" offset="584202">These tractors are the motored, the motor vehicle that hitch on to the trailers and tow them.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.268" offset="620983">And at that time each of these vendors took a -- took a conditional sales contract after a down payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.333" offset="669257">And those contracts were recorded as required by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.989" offset="691931">And there is no question in this case anywhere of lack of good faith on the part of anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.367" offset="729443">The -- that was in February and March of 1953, that these vehicles were purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.213" offset="768836">In the following January, the Eastern Carting Company having before them on all of these contracts, the appellants exercising their rights under the contract replevied their -- their tractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.364" offset="837381">That was in accordance with the legal procedure provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.013" offset="855980">They were sold at public auction bid in by the two appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.855" offset="879386">The International Company immediately resold its tractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.484" offset="901851">One to a Massachusetts Corporation, which ceased to have anything to do with New York, the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.569" offset="938214">The other, too, was connected to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.571" offset="950230">Brockway still had possession of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.378" offset="965486">This -- this replevin then took place in -- in January, in a -- I beg you pardon, January 22nd of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.342" offset="1017313">April 21st following that, the State Tax Commission for the first time gave notice that it was attaching under its -- under the lien provided by statute all three or two of these -- two of these tractors and the proceeds of the sale of the third.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.750" offset="1118981">It being the contention and the -- the State Tax law and I can narrow this proceeding somewhat, this highway tax law, in the case before you, presents no question of the right of the State to levy the tax in the -- measured in the way that it is measured in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.221" offset="1216784">That is to say, there's as in addition to other taxes, this tax shall be from the carrier except where the carrier is not the owner of such vehicular unit and the tax shall be joined and -- and I beg your pardon, where the carrier is not the owner, the tax should be joined in several liability upon both the owner and the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.188" offset="1328692">This tax is based on the gross weight of each particular vehicle and the number of miles it is operated on the public highways in this State and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.024" offset="1384072">The tax for each vehicle shall be computed by multiplying the number of miles operated on the public highways in the State by the appropriate weight group.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.873" offset="1439451">That is, these are tractors of more than 18,000 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.153" offset="1468604">When an vehicular -- well I will not read the rest of it because it doesn't apply to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.674" offset="1486681">Now, the next section provide how this tax is to be paid -- is to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.599" offset="1514371">There's no dispute between the parties as to the -- the first section of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.576" offset="1538299">We raise no question of the validity of the way the tax is to be measured or its fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.218" offset="1564839">But when it comes to the payment of the tax then our controversy arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.212" offset="1592842">At the time of filing a return, that is once a month, as required by this article, each carrier shall pay the Tax Commission, the tax imposed for a period covered by the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.725" offset="1650834">The regulation, the company regulation provide -- that's in detail, how that is to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.626" offset="1674449">The form of the return should be filed once a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.351" offset="1689391">And the tax shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.802" offset="1715200">Now then, the fees, taxes, penalties and interest, accruing under this article shall constitute a lien upon all motor vehicles and vehicular units of each such carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.265" offset="1781029">The lien shall attach at the time of the operation of any motor vehicle or vehicular unit of such carrier within the State and it shall remain effective until the fees, taxes, penalties and interest are paid or the motor vehicle is sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.532" offset="1862113">Such liens -- that this where our dispute arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.539" offset="1878100">Such liens -- well that's a lien for all the taxes of the carrier, not -- not the taxes on our particular unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.909" offset="1927628">This carrier operated, it is stipulated, 15 of these vehicles at -- at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.176" offset="1960647">Except the law says such lien shall be paramount to all prior liens or encumbrances of any character and to the rights of any holder of the legal title in or to such motor vehicle or vehicular unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.131" offset="2036506">Now, the -- the case as presented on the part of the appellees is -- is a case presented on the theory of lien priority, the State having enacted this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.982" offset="2107873">The appellees that take the position that that lien is paramount to all other rights in these vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.201" offset="2148728">Our position is a very simple one, that shocking as it may sound, our vehicles have been seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.375" offset="2189479">Our property interest in our vehicles have been seized to pay the total liabilities of a carrier for the highway use taxes, penalties and interest for which we are not liable, have not been liable and could not be liable under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.352" offset="2285401">Now, the reason from my making this last statement in this form is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.736" offset="2306926">This statute contained another section, which is not necessary to go into here, providing that the -- in those instances where the carrier is not the owner of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.241" offset="2372963">The owner may file the return on his own behalf and -- and maintain the records required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.339" offset="2413296">And he shall be jointly and severally liable with the carrier for the payment of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.810" offset="2447151">Now, the first anomaly here is that the Attorney General has ruled in a formal opinion, which is quoted in the briefs of both of the parties here, has ruled that the holder of a -- that a conditional vendor, which we were originally here, is not an owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.740" offset="2554880">And that he is not liable for the payment of the tax nor is he permitted to file under this section, the necessary documents which would clear away any lien on the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.795" offset="2619141">That is the first element in this case that gives singularity to it and takes it a little out of the -- takes at the great deal out of the ordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.013" offset="2668042">Now, the -- the --</text>

            <text syncTime="686.613" offset="2746410">We've been trying to secure an answer for from the Commission, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.460" offset="2765740">The -- under the New York law, frankly, a conditional vendor is the holder of a security interest and the case of the Tax Commission is based on the theory, I think you will find, that a -- that there are just two liens, one of the State and one of the conditional vendor.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.026" offset="2876082">Therefore, the State is given priority by law and that's the beginning and end of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="778.231" offset="3112856">Now, we're perfectly familiar with the cases which hold that where an inchoate lien attaches, it -- it's dated back to the -- when this is liquidated to the time when -- when the lien first acquired.</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.684" offset="7610723">But this a case where there was no benefit to us and therefore no lawful tax could have been imposed, constitutionally, except for the use of our trucks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.175" offset="7748650">And we're quite familiar with the rules of law which hold, as I have said, that where a tax is impose of an inchoate character like that and later on it becomes fixed in a mound, then that dates back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.996" offset="7831928">Now, we don't contest that in this case, but here was a secret lien.</text>

            <text syncTime="1967.801" offset="7871112">This lien was not -- unlike that lien of the collector of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.766" offset="7890965">Those liens have been so often before the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.272" offset="7905071">Those are liens where the collector files a liquidated claim and he files it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.437" offset="7929731">He's required by law to file it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.645" offset="7938508">Now, in this case, this lien was not required to be filed anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.124" offset="7960451">It was what Justice Cardozo called in the Maclay case a caveat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.054" offset="7980199">It was noticed that if that they take -- that if the carrier that -- that it was noticed that if the carrier did not pay his taxes, then this would become a liquidated lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.822" offset="8055223">Now, at the time of the seizure of these -- of these tractors, I go back to that, in the ordinary course of business, the right of the carrier has been extinguished in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.879" offset="8115513">The appellants were the -- now the legal -- now the legal owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.113" offset="8132441">Now, this lien is in short a sort of a cloud on title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.580" offset="8154279">It -- its floating there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.863" offset="8163370">If the man pays his bills, there is no lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.001" offset="8183954">It's -- it's in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.189" offset="8188656">It's noticed that there may be a lien literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.516" offset="8206002">And in -- in that case the -- in -- in -- and -- and there you'll have a situation where the -- the purpose of a lien, the traditional lien, the common law lien, the purpose of a lien was to give notice to a purchaser or a -- or an interested party that there was a lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.987" offset="8315925">So that, and this all important, he might go to the recording office or the assessment office or the State Tax Commission and ascertain whether there was a liquidated lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.800" offset="8379141">But in this case, and I keep emphasizing it, the State itself made that impossible because it made it a crime to disclose anything about -- about this delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.304" offset="8441208">Now, it's significant, I think, in that connection, although not at all, of great importance, that the legislature of this last year following the opinion below, in this case, has added a clause to the secrecy provision and of which authorizes the State Tax Commission periodically to print lists of tax delinquents under this statute, so that men can now ascertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.472" offset="8553848">But the lien, and my point is, in this case owing to these peculiar facts, the lien was legally ineffective as against the property right of -- of these appellants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2229.366" offset="8917368">Now, it will also be urged that it vested the State Tax Commission to say, how this should be levied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2258.804" offset="9035128">There's nothing in this statute, may I emphasize, either that would prevent, if you read and interpret the State Tax Commission, when it came to enforcing its lien against the (Inaudible) that -- that these are problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.903" offset="9095523">There's nothing in the statute that would or have prevented that from charging us the correct amount of -- of our taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.048" offset="9128124">But that isn't what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.216" offset="9136797">And I keep -- I keep repeating that and perhaps too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.544" offset="9150171">In other words, we say the State neither the State nor the Tax Commission have the power to impose on us a liability that concededly, that incurred against another and compel us to pay the full amount of that liability for no other reason than that at one time we sold three trucks under vendor's -- under vendor's contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.385" offset="9265528">And so far as being given notice to this concern, I have already referred to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.767" offset="9291024">The doctrine of imputation of knowledge does not apply in this case because all the knowledge that was given us was notice that there would be a lien and unless taxes were paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2350.446" offset="9401783">Now, the -- there's one other feature of this which -- which I think goes perhaps to the looseness of the statute itself and may explain something of what has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.101" offset="9452356">This statute carries with it the regulations made by the Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.588" offset="9478269">The Tax Commission in addition to the -- what I have read as to how returns should be made and the separate milage and the separate tax assessed against each vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.245" offset="9528947">In addition to that, the -- the Tax Commission provides that before the Tax Commission can proceed to enforce its rights against the carrier, I'm talking about the Eastern, they must give him notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.098" offset="9600313">They must assess the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.884" offset="9611494">They must give him notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.555" offset="9618181">They must -- they must give him notice of any -- they must propose sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2415.230" offset="9660918">And the statute also provides, as you will see in the Appendix to our reply brief, that so far as our carrier concerned, he is also given a specific right of court review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.923" offset="9715670">Not one of those protective rights is given us under this statute on the theory, apparently, that we're merely -- we're merely conditional vendors who merely hold the title to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.674" offset="9778678">We have no review.</text>

            <text syncTime="4319.655" offset="17278537">And seemingly, the rationale of this argument is because we have tried to be fair, because we have a right to this apportionment that we've somehow limited our sovereign right to collect the tax.</text>
