            <text syncTime="42.327" offset="169273">This is a motion by the State of Wisconsin for leave to file a complaint in an original action against the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.081" offset="228310">The motion proposed complaint and brief were served upon the proper officials in the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.414" offset="261642">The Governor and the Attorney General of that State on the 14th, of October 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.944" offset="295706">No answer or other pleading has been served by the State of Tennessee except a brief, which was served and filed and which we construe in the nature of a demurrer to our proposed complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.923" offset="363624">We believe the jurisdiction is conferred on this Court by Article 3 Section 2, Clause 2 because it is an action in which one of the sovereign states is a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.303" offset="421198">In this action, both parties are sovereign states and we believe that Section 1251 (a) of Title 28 of the United States Code gives exclusive jurisdiction of this proposed action to this honorable body.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.364" offset="501447">The principal question involved in this proposed action is, does a Tennessee statute which allows residence of a marketing area in Tennessee to sell milk and milk products below a prevailing price without restriction, but subjects the residence of a -- of the State of Wisconsin to a thread of prosecution if they make sales below said prevailing price constitute a direct and undue burden upon interstate commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="167.723" offset="670824">It is our position that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.214" offset="692767">We believe that it is discriminatory against interstate commerce and hence violative of the Commerce Clause, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3, and also violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, Article 14, Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.347" offset="781375">The controversy arose as a result of the passage in the State of Tennessee of Public Law 74 of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.631" offset="846472">In this Act, it provides in substance that any person who shall sell milk or milk products in any marketing area for a less than the wholesale or retail price at the place of sale, when such milk has been prepared or processed for resale and transported into the marketing area from any point outside of the marketing area has committed a proscribed act.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.858" offset="971337">A shortened quotation from paragraph A of Public Act 74 describes the unlawful act as follows" To sell within any marketing area at wholesale or retail for less than the prevailing wholesale or retail price at the place of sale any of the following named products, market milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.048" offset="1080111">And then they enumerate all various kinds of fluid milk, butter milk and cream that have been prepared or processed for resale and have been transported in the said marketing area from any point outside of said marketing area".</text>
            <text syncTime="292.875" offset="1171435">Anyone violating the provisions of Public Law 74 will be subjected to penalties up to $300 or by imprisonment not to exceed three months or by both, such imprisonment and fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.226" offset="1276865">It is the position of the State of Wisconsin that this law, the mere passage of this law creates a barrier to the free flow of milk from the State of Wisconsin into the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.570" offset="1354188">And additional prescription in this Act permits an injunctional proceeding by the Commissioner of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.857" offset="1411344">So, with the passage of this Act, the milk producers in Wisconsin are faced with injunction and prosecution if they transport milk into the State of Tennessee and attempt to sell it competitively in that State.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.883" offset="1583438">This is a matter of great importance, this free interstate commerce in milk to the State of Wisconsin and to the thousands of milk producers in the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.870" offset="1655432">The second greatest industry in Wisconsin is the dairy industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.546" offset="1690122">We produce tremendous quantities of milk in the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.711" offset="1714782">Prior to the passage of this law, substantial quantities of milk produced have been sold in the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.806" offset="1755220">In the State of Wisconsin, there are 107,000 farm families engaged in the production of milk, and in 1954, the State of Wisconsin produced 16.5 billion pounds of milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.965" offset="1827840">In addition to that, we exported from the State of Wisconsin more than 1 billion pounds of milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.786" offset="1867128">This industry is vital to the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.636" offset="1882488">The export of this milk, we have a tremendous reservoir of milk available to the people of America if we are not prevented by a maze of discriminatory statutes and regulations and barriers from moving it freely in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.442" offset="1961691">Those 107,000 farm families in Wisconsin have more than 2,600,000 producing dairy cattle and more than 4 million cattle on their farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.748" offset="2022922">The value of this milk exceeds $500 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.775" offset="2055001">And the total volume of butter fat in addition to that milk shipped in interstate commerce out of the State of Wisconsin in 1954 exceeded 28.5 million pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.335" offset="2117277">So, this industry is vital to the State of Wisconsin and the free flow of this milk is essential to prevent the depression of dairy prices in our state if this milk is not permitted to move freely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.612" offset="6666344">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.620" offset="6678465">We don't think that jurisdiction of this Court to entertain suits between states rest upon the effect that an individual suit might have on the pocket book of some citizen of one of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.802" offset="6731128">It's our position first of all that the State of Wisconsin under the allegations of this complaint has not stated a cause which properly invokes the original jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.909" offset="6787553">Secondly, that the state of facts in Wisconsin's proposed complaint justified this Court in exercising its discretion in the matter in refusing to take jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.053" offset="6844186">And thirdly, that the statute is not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.523" offset="6862054">Now, getting to a number of questions that have been raised from the bench with regard to the rights of a private or individual producer in the State of Wisconsin to institute such an action, it's our position that there is nothing in the world to prevent a producer in the State of Wisconsin if the facts are such that bring him within the terms of the Act from coming into the State of Tennessee and sue in there either in the state courts or in the District Court of the United States, or if an action is brought against them in the state court, he can resist on the grounds of the invalidity of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.758" offset="7047001">As a matter of fact, a suit to test the statute wherein it is alleged that the Act is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause is now pending in the United States District Court in Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.960" offset="7103739">The pleadings and the orders in that case as set out in the brief that there is a private litigant who is in Court who's fighting just as hard as he can to get the same kind of relief that Wisconsin is trying to get by the exercise of original jurisdiction in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.905" offset="7175523">And the matter is now pending, waiting for it to be set before a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.485" offset="7205930">Now, this matter is of primary importance for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.336" offset="7233306">It's well known (Inaudible) only those who are affected by the statute can question its constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.703" offset="7270713">Now, as an example of what I'm talking about with particular reference to the situation that we have before us, suppose the state passes an Act taxing the sale of automobile tires and suppose I as a merchant go in and allege that I am a merchant that I don't like the statute and I want it stricken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.919" offset="7363605">Well, I think I would have to go on and allege that I was engaged in the sale of automobile tires before acted -- get the Court to pass on the validity of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.388" offset="7405505">Now, we say that that's exactly the position that the State of Wisconsin is in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.582" offset="7426299">Wisconsin said we have a dairy industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.695" offset="7438733">We've got so many cows and we produce so much milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.385" offset="7453466">But the only allegation in this proposed complaint that comes anywhere near a showing that Wisconsin people and Wisconsin producers will be in any way affected by this Act is the allegation that huge quantities of milk produced in Wisconsin have been sold in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.209" offset="7548761">Now the statute forbids certain marketing practices if done with intent to injure or destroy competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.747" offset="7586900">It forbids the sale of milk that had been transported into a marketing area at less than the prevailing wholesale or retail prices place of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.971" offset="7631830">Marketing areas are defined as being counties that have within their borders municipalities which have ordinance is regulating the grading of milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.155" offset="7684598">There is no allegation in this proposed complaint to any Wisconsin producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.645" offset="7706540">Transports milk into any marketing area in the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.596" offset="7726289">There is no allegation in this proposed complaint that any Wisconsin producer has sold milk transported in such a marketing area so as to violate the terms of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.339" offset="7777280">Furthermore, there is no allegation that any Wisconsin producer has any desire to do anything that could possibly be construed as a violation of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.961" offset="7823778">Now, the point I'm making is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.596" offset="7834331">And it was set up by this Court in the case of United Public Workers against Mitchell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.380" offset="7857424">Unless there is a real controversy, neither this Court nor any other Court has jurisdiction to entertain a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.392" offset="7893473">Now, in that case, the complainants went even further than Wisconsin has gone here because they alleged that they wanted to engage in certain political activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.771" offset="7939030">They wanted to be poll workers and they wanted to go out and solicit for various candidates and all those things were forbidden by the Hatch Act and they said for that reason, it's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.974" offset="7987827">But this Court held that they should have been repelled in the lower court and the suit was finally entertained as to only one complainant who had actually done something that violated the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.235" offset="8056895">Now that brings us down to this proposition, before any suit, in any court should be entertained to test the validity of this Act, the complainant in the suit should be required to show that he has an interest in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.165" offset="8128575">He has an interest that is adversely affected by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.010" offset="8148010">That is a matter that can be threshed out in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.357" offset="8165355">That is a matter that can be threshed out in the state court between some individual producer in the State of Tennessee or some competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.163" offset="8208614">All those matters can be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.125" offset="8216451">A searching inquiry can be gone into, to find out whether or not the Act affects him and whether or not he's entitled to maintain it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4191.621" offset="16766433">Counsel for Tennessee apparently isn't aware of the fact if the Director of Agriculture of the State of Tennessee has placed him a mail and sent to the processors of milk, shipping milk into the State of Tennessee a copy of Public Law 74 which we are here discussing without comment what the processor felt the clear implication of that notice was that the State of Tennessee did intend to enforce the law against people who attempted to deliver milk into the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.848" offset="16943334">It was our position in our plea for right to file a complaint here that speed is one of the reasons -- expeditious relief is one of the reasons for granting a litigant the right to come in parens patriae and represent their people.</text>

            <text syncTime="4294.630" offset="17178436">The processor in this particular type of industry stands between the producer and the ultimate consumer and his interest may not coincide with the interest of the producer in getting his milk into the hands of consumers.</text>
