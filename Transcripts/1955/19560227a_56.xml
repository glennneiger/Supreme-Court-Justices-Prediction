            <label>Ms. Elizabeth Hulen Grayson</label>
            <text syncTime="39.563" offset="158198">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.153" offset="164571">This case is before this Court on certiorari from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.650" offset="190589">It arises out of the seizure of an automobile as violating the statute against a vehicle transporting whiskey without tax on it which is Section 26 U.S.C.A. 3321.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.983" offset="251925">A petition was -- for remission was filed by the Murdock Acceptance Corporation under Section 18 U.S.C.A. 3617.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.703" offset="294766">The position being taken and it now being admitted that Murdock Acceptance Corporation was a good faith lienor, that it acquired its lien on this automobile in good faith with no knowledge that it would be used for the transportation of -- of liquor in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.575" offset="362266">And that it inquired its lien after an investigation and inquiry as required by the statute at the proper place and from the proper Federal law-enforcement office of the Alcohol Tax Unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.660" offset="418586">That it had received form the Alcohol Tax Unit its standard form reply always used when the subject had no reputation or record for violating the liquor laws of the State -- of any state of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.801" offset="479190">It, therefore, filed its petition as now admitted that it has complied to that extent with every phase of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.374" offset="509492">Its petition for remission was denied by the District Judge in the Eastern District of Louisiana where the car was seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.238" offset="536869">In his opinion, the District Judge stated and took the position that he had discretion regardless of the fact that the claimant had complied with the requirements of the statute as to inquiry and regardless of being a good faith lienor, that he had discretion to deny the remission.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.978" offset="615863">An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and was -- there, the decision of the District Judge was almost summarily affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.969" offset="647837">Now, of our own petition for rehearing, Mr. Justice Tuttle wrote a strong dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.981" offset="671869">As late as the -- as the briefs in this Court on petition for certiorari, the Government has taken the position that the discretion of that District Judge is not reviewable by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.289" offset="721084">We have an illustration in this case of our great democracy at work and that we have here a case involving One 1951 Chevrolet which after three years of storage and the passage of time could not be worth over $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.529" offset="786077">We have, however, in this case, the Murdock Acceptance Corporation which indirectly is standing before this Court on behalf of our finance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.370" offset="825469">We all realized that our economy is bottomed on credit buying, that our manufacturing industry is bottomed on the continuance of that large credit buying.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.541" offset="878132">We also realized that credit selling to continue in the course in which it is now progressing must be also bottomed on stability of its security on the knowledge that its right in two (Inaudible) will be determined by a court of law according to established principles with the right of review, not merely as done before 1936 by mercy and justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.183" offset="984712">The facts in this case are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.071" offset="992235">It was tried on an agreed statement of facts which is only two pages in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.853" offset="1011357">This car was sold by -- the paper was purchased by Murdock Acceptance Corporation which is a Tennessee corporation operating in surrounding state.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.584" offset="1046256">At its Jackson, Mississippi office, it was tendered to Murdock Acceptance Corporation by a dealer and prior to acquiring the -- the paper, Murdock Acceptance Corporation made inquiry of the proposed purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.096" offset="1108323">There is no question in this case as to the type of inquiry or the wording of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.909" offset="1127549">The inquiry is made as to both record and reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.444" offset="1141760">There is no question in this case as to the location of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.332" offset="1165270">The inquiry was made of the highest Federal law-enforcement office in the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.258" offset="1192960">It was made at the proper place and that it is admitted and agreed that the Jackson office, which was a statewide office, had statewide jurisdiction and the inquiry could have been made at no other place in the State of Mississippi, that had it been made in any other of the -- what they call the "field offices" which might have been a little closer to the residence of the -- of purchaser that they would have immediately been referred to the Jackson office.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.285" offset="1293061">And therefore, no question is raised by the Government as to the place of inquiry or as to -- or the office has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.838" offset="1323259">It is admitted that the inquiries made of the only Federal law-enforcement officer that where inquiry could have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.434" offset="1357636">Then the paper was purchased upon the receipt of the following answer from the Alcohol Tax Unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.036" offset="1384072">And that answer was a form answer rather in the nature of bureaus and administrative bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.789" offset="1415105">It was stamped on the bottom of the letter of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.625" offset="1430465">The only blank in the answer was for the date and for the signature of the officer signing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.679" offset="1454707">It was the form answer admittedly used in every case where there was no record or reputation for violation of liquor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.260" offset="1492950">It was -- therefore, the only answer which the Murdock could have gotten where there was no record or reputation or for violation of liquor laws, that answer contained the following languages and stated it was a stamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.220" offset="1560869">No record or reputation as of blank date period.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.185" offset="1584692">This office does not have a complete file of our local and state arrest and prosecutions nor does it have knowledge of what reputation that kept -- prospect might have among state officers (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="436.096" offset="1744353">We -- though, we do not know that since this case has arisen, they have changed that form, whether it would continue, we don't know what the -- but at that time that form had been in use for we know -- I don't know how long but I know since before 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.178" offset="1808614">Because that same reply had been approved by the Treasury Department and our remission had been granted by the Treasury Department on that exactly the same reply before the new statute in 1936, giving the courts exclusive jurisdiction of remission.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.284" offset="1877055">And the -- the Treasury Department, had for many years before then as -- as admitted by the Government, held that that form reply was satisfactory and sufficient and that that was -- was a reply that they had no record or reputation.</text>

            <text syncTime="486.233" offset="1944869">There was a standard form but -- but -- that there was standard form but it made it just as vague as -- as if it hadn't been a standard form.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.299" offset="1993143">I mean the -- it is not -- it -- it didn't cover the whole field in the answer and then apparently on purpose it didn't -- didn't cover the field.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.604" offset="2054374">Of course they could have used another form but it is admitted that that is the only one that -- that the ATU you would give them.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.442" offset="2105678">Now, if there was a record or reputation at that office or with that headquarters, they would write, "So and so has a record in such and such a court and we understand that he -- or we think at this office that he has a reputation."</text>
            <text syncTime="538.627" offset="2154475">If he had a record or reputation that was written on -- on the bottom of the letter, if not, the stamp was used which what they intended and felt was a complete denial as complete as they would make or could make in any case.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.553" offset="3242109">That we didn't have to make the inquiry anywhere except the ATU that the location was sufficient, that we didn't have to then make the shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.183" offset="3272725">But they -- the Government takes the position that that qualifying language is sufficient that it was not a negative language, if Your Honors please, and not only told them nothing we do not know anyway, is not only as Judge -- Mr. Justice Tuttle pointed out so brilliantly in his dissenting opinion, the only truthful answer that any officer could make.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.863" offset="3351406">Otherwise, you cannot have an officer guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.773" offset="3363004">The statute does not require that you have an officer guarantee to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.564" offset="3378155">He has -- and to say to you, he has no record or reputation with this office or with us and any that we know of, but we -- we know that he has none with no office or anywhere in the world with no other office.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.430" offset="3425698">No officer can be expected to guarantee that or to make such a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.855" offset="3443357">Therefore, the silence at the end of the answer was merely a general statement known to the person who inquired and the only truthful statement he can make.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.657" offset="3478570">But not only that, Murdock Acceptance Corporation knew and it is admitted they knew that there were long line of cases going clear back to 1937, where the courts of every Court of Appeals where it has arisen, beginning in United States versus One Dodge in Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, 88 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.972" offset="3559863">That inquiry only needed to be made of any one of the officers, either the sheriff's office or the ATU office or the city office.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.153" offset="3592568">And that if they had -- that purchaser had no record or reputation of liquor law violator with that office or at that office that then it was immaterial whether or not he had record or reputation with any other officers or at any other location or among any other officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.257" offset="3664980">That being true, what he was told by the ATU, the courts have said was immaterial that we had -- he has no record or reputation with us as a liquor law violator.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.099" offset="3704372">We just don't know what he may have -- don't guarantee that we know everything about him and that we cannot guarantee that he has none anywhere and that's all it said and under the decisions of every Court of Appeals at the time this inquiry was made, there were -- there were at least 15 or 20 decisions to that effect, then the inquiry was absolutely satisfactory and sufficient.But not only that, if the Court please, then we've come to the most outstanding, I think, admissions of the Government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.115" offset="3824431">They not only admit that -- that Murdock Acceptance Corporation was a good faith lienor with no knowledge or information whatsoever detrimental beyond that answer if that could be called detrimental.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.517" offset="3874064">That they received the only answer that would be given to them by the ATU if there was no record and the only answer that they could get from the highest Federal enforcement officer where there was no record.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.440" offset="3917740">But they also admitted that the ATU interpreted that answer as being a flat denial of any record or reputation that they intended it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.063" offset="3952222">That they intended that answer to protect a claimant making an inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.913" offset="3983569">Now, the Government stands before this Court and makes those admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.284" offset="3997048">We thought it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.823" offset="4003213">We intended it to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.893" offset="4011572">They also go further and admit that for 20 years since the new statute was passed in 1936, giving the courts jurisdiction, the sufficiency of that answer has never been challenged in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.196" offset="4056712">That there has been any number of District Courts who have held -- held the claimant entitled to remission, where exactly the same answer was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.573" offset="4102269">But after justice -- Department of Justice ever challenging the sufficiency and the answer and without it ever being questioned that they also admit that that fact was known to the -- to the Murdock Acceptance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.535" offset="4154096">In fact, they do not deny the effectiveness of this -- certified copies we have attest in our brief of cases from the State of Mississippi where the identical answer came up in decisions not challenging that answer but where some other question was involved and where that answer was the one that was received and where the Court held that -- again and again that they were entitled to remission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.613" offset="4242390">And where Mr. Wimbish, the Director of the Mississippi Department of the ATU, testified on the stand that that was -- and four years before this paper was accepted that that was the answer by which they meant they had no record or reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.887" offset="4299546">It therefore says it admitted that they intended it that they interpreted it in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.760" offset="4318981">That the Department of Justice had never challenged it but the District Courts had held it sufficient for 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.124" offset="4344477">And as they go further and admit that the Treasury Department prior to 1936, when enforcing the old statute by which they -- they were given discretion only to grant remissions or where there had not been any willful fraud -- willful negligence on the purpose of fraud, that the Department of Treasury interpreted that answer as sufficient not to constitute willful negligence for intent -- or purpose of fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.351" offset="5453322">There are three, of course, requirements of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.978" offset="5463876">The first two are admitted here except -- except unless they contend that this answer gives them something to stand on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.412" offset="5497626">The first one is good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.066" offset="5504209">It must be approved of good faith lienor which is admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.939" offset="5515703">The second that he had no reason to believe that the vehicle would be used for the violation of the -- of laws of any state of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.077" offset="5556245">The only thing they knew, which is admitted here, was this answer which was received from the ATU Then the third requirement is the making of the inquiry which they -- what we must make of only one -- we make of only one of the three officers in the ATU as the profit officer and get a negative reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.971" offset="5627820">Now, the statute -- this Honorable Court has held that it should be interpreted according to the test laid down by the Department of the Treasury -- the Secretary of the Treasury before the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.714" offset="5682782">The statute was enactedclearly insofar as I see to take from the Treasury Department the pure discretion which was not reviewable by the Court and to give it to -- exclusive jurisdiction to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.484" offset="5737848">But under that statute, which this Court in United States versus One 1939 Ford, stated should be the basis of determination of its construction of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.048" offset="5788108">Well, it should be that those tests in what -- and the acts of the Treasury Department before the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.982" offset="5815902">It is admitted here and stated that the Treasury Department, before it became a judicial matter, granted remissions consistently without questioning it whether this answer was received and interpreted it as being a sufficient answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.889" offset="5883507">The question is, what did -- does the statute mean by inquiring, which we did, and getting an answer that he had no record or reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.761" offset="5914958">Does the statute demand that you get an answer from that one place, the only place you have to go and make the inquiry that we know he has no record or reputation anywhere or does the statute merely say you need only to go to one officer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.566" offset="5970233">Congress knowing quite well that one officer would not know whether he had a record or reputation anywhere in the world and would not know what his reputation might be in some other place, but you only have -- the Congress said, you only have to go to one office and get a negative reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.221" offset="6036793">And what Congress meant was that a negative reply as far as that office was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.036" offset="6064065">The Government has taken a position that we should have made the same inquiry as you do of critic of -- of the credit and that we wouldn't stop for the credit investigation unless they guaranteed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.367" offset="6113384">If Your Honor please, if -- if a credit -- any credit agency ever said, "We guarantee that this person has -- is good -- a good credit risk."</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.948" offset="6151732">Then it would have been a most unusual credit agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.656" offset="6170540">In fact, the Associated Credit Bureau of America use a form in making their credit reports and they -- it contains this language, "This report is given simply as an aid in determining the propriety of extending credit of the value or condition of the -- of an existing credit and it's based upon information obtained from sources deemed reliable, the accuracy of which hour is in no matter guaranteed."</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.682" offset="6266671">And that in effect was all that the ATU was saying and all that any truthful officer could say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.958" offset="6299794">In our opinion he -- he has no record or reputation with us as a liquor law violator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.563" offset="6318184">Insofar as we know he has none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.786" offset="6327066">But we do not guarantee that we cover the well and that we can cover everything that might have happened in any court or in any office of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.537" offset="6366145">We are submitting to Your Honors that this administrative interpretation concurred in by other courts over a period of 20 to 30 years is -- if reasonable whatsoever is binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.159" offset="6424555">And it's binding on this Court under the authority of Bowles versus Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.728" offset="6446811">That also the same result is reached by a liberal construction of this highly penal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.617" offset="6470426">This forfeiture of property or property rights by a liberal construction of that statute would be that the -- the statute does not require that a claimant, before he can buy a paper, must go find some officer who will say, "I guarantee and I know of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.350" offset="6541375">I have -- I have a record of every arrest and prosecution in the United States and I guarantee that he has no record or reputation."</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.164" offset="6876578">As Mrs. Grayson has said the facts in this case are supremely simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.729" offset="6898834">Leon Oatis was driving his 1951 Chevrolet along in Louisiana in April of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.801" offset="6939167">Investigators of the Internal Revenue Service stopped him and found 20 gallons of unpaid whiskey -- untaxed, unpaid whiskey in the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.800" offset="6987128">We don't know what happened to Mr. Oatis and we don't know what happened to the whiskey, but we are interested in the 1951 Chevrolet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.117" offset="7024431">When Oatis had purchased this car in the preceding November at a price of $2200 which seems a rather extraordinarily large sum to pay for a car which was at least one year old and maybe two, he borrowed on it --</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.309" offset="7173224">He borrowed on this car $1590, the conditional sales contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.517" offset="7194018">In that contract, it was transferred to Murdock Acceptance Corporation, the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.435" offset="7221708">After the car was seized with the whiskey in it, the United States Attorney filed a libel of information in the District Court asking for forfeiture of the car to the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.698" offset="7462766">And it must show that proper inquiry has been made at the headquarters of the sheriff, the chief of police, of the federal revenue agent at -- at three places, one, the place where the purchaser live, two, the place where the purchaser bought the car, and three, any other place where the finance corporation makes investigation as to credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.954" offset="7575719">And it must receive a reply from -- in response to these inquiries that the purchaser has no record or reputation as a liquor violator either of state or federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3671.321" offset="14685205">There is just question that I felt maybe had not been completely answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.087" offset="14704327">That was the statement of first the warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.504" offset="14713940">There was no warning, if Your Honor please, to this answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.140" offset="14724493">If it had been given as to one purchaser, yes, it might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.145" offset="14740480">But when each and every purchaser was given -- you were given the same answer then it's not possible for each and every person to have a record of reputation much less probable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.815" offset="14779246">So, there was no warning as to this particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.491" offset="14793874">It's -- it was warning as to everybody regardless where any inquiry is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.007" offset="14811951">The question was raised as to whether now the courts are turned to interpret the statute now rather than the Treasury Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.863" offset="14835357">If Your Honors please, yes, the courts are now -- maybe perhaps for the first time having this presented, although the District Courts all over the country have had it presented and it decided that they were entitled to remission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.332" offset="14881228">But the rule in interpretation of the kind of answer that is required by the statute that should be effective here is of where, over a period of 30 years, those officers, given the duty of enforcing the statute, have interpreted that statute in one way for 20 to 30 years, concurred in by the judiciary, concurred in by the Department of Justice that then that method of interpretation of the statute is controlling on this Court if it is at all reasonable, if it is subject whatsoever to that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.736" offset="15026887">So, we are asking this Court to construe it liberally as a highly forfeited penalize -- penal statute and to construe it in accordance with this long established departmental or administrative construction which is they admit it's reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.717" offset="15090834">That so far as they go in their briefs as to say it's possible for it have another construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.734" offset="15110896">And as this Court said in U.S. versus One 1939 Ford, the forfeiture acts are exceedingly drastic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.104" offset="15144333">They were intended for the protection of the revenues not to punish without fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.764" offset="15163037">It would require unclouded language to compel the conclusion that Congress abandoned the equitable policy observed for a very long time of relieving those who act in good faith and without negligence.</text>
