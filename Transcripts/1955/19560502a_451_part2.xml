          <heading>Argument of Edson Smith</heading>
          <turn speaker="edson_smith" startTime="0.000" stopTime="609.337">
            <label>Mr. Edson Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Calling the -- the Court's attention to the ways that the union spends the money that it collects under compulsory union membership contracts from unwilling members and I was saying that I had printed in the appendix at the back of my brief, an excerpt from a senatorial committee report showing that the CIO in Michigan that spent hundreds of thousands of dollars of union dues money to help elect democrats to public office in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.246" offset="144927">The investigation, by a number of the universities, showed about 40% of these union members were republicans whose dues money was going to elect candidates they personally upholds.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.388" offset="217548">Thomas Jefferson wrote a number of things among them, he said this, "To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical."</text>
            <text syncTime="68.891" offset="275540">In Section 211, it qualifies as just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.896" offset="295497">Now, certainly, Congress couldn't impose a tax and turn the tax money over to one political party but it can do it by -- composed by imposing by Section 211, compulsory union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.999" offset="371984">Congress can't impose a tax over religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.398" offset="389538">This Court is so held on several occasions but unions can take their money and donate it to religious institutions and do, were recently notice in the newspaper an article that the teamsters had given $9000 to a Catholic high school in Tacoma Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.384" offset="457456">If it were a voluntary organization, fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.187" offset="472712">The Protestants have done better.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.227" offset="480862">The CIO, Philip Murray fund, which is made up from donations from CIO unions as well as some individual contributions, recently donated $200,000 to the National Counsel of churches.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.013" offset="548049">And other unions have made donations, the largest one recently so made by the Ladies' Garment Workers' of $1 million to build a hospital in Beersheba, Israel.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.544" offset="594129">That union, it said the new -- the article in Time which I have quoted in the appendix in the brief also said it donated to various or worthy projects, I would say, $25 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.983" offset="651912">Now, this money is being taken from people on the theory that there are the free writers unless they give them -- turn their money over to the union for these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.425" offset="709695">Now, I'm not going to have time to talk much about the right to work or a certain contractual rights like seniority that are involved here, but I -- I do want to mention one other thing that the union collects money for in the form of dues and fees and assessments and that its life insurance programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.100" offset="800392">One of them requires $1.30 per month as union dues which goes to life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.978" offset="831843">And this life insurance program collected out of union dues, it gives these unions a little better disciplinary power than the other ways would have because at any time, they want to exercise discipline over these involuntary members.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.624" offset="898403">They can suspend them and thereby, the -- by suspending them they cancel their insurance rights or if a man who has been a union member for many, many years and this buildup a substantial value in his insurance program out of union dues should refuse to go out on strike on some occasion taken, expel him or suspend him and thereby cancel his insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.441" offset="1001744">So that his membership and his requirement of paying dues involves -- it gives the union considerable disciplinary power over the involuntary member.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.007" offset="1047928">Now, the right to work, freedom of association, as I've said our -- this Court has held in a number of occasions, are fundamental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.099" offset="1092336">Some of these fundamental rights which cannot be taken away because of protection by the Constitution cannot be taken away by the Government either state or -- or local may be taken away by private action unless they are protected by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.149" offset="1176555">We have state laws that protect the individual from private aggression, state homicide laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.564" offset="1214171">A man's life is protected from the Federal Government by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment from State Government by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment but there's no constitutional protection from a -- other individual private action taking his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.673" offset="1294629">Now, I want to put in extreme illustration here and I'm getting the governmental action now, which is the only subject that Mr. Schoene argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.474" offset="1325871">Suppose, and I'll say it can't happen here, I'm just putting it for a drastic illustration, that Congress had said that any man who would refuse to join the -- the union may make a contract requiring that all people in the craft or class joined the union and if they refused to join, they may be executed by agreement between the union and the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.856" offset="1439347">Now, Mr. Schoene would say, "That's all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.660" offset="1450632">That's constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.605" offset="1458364">It's perfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.185" offset="1460663">It's private action.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.962" offset="1467768">It's purely permissive of the statute that Congress didn't make it mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.140" offset="1488457">The man's life is not being taken away by governmental action, it's purely private action.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.138" offset="1508519">So, no constitutional right is violated."</text>
            <text syncTime="379.952" offset="1519804">But it's -- he would say, "The Congress has preempted the field of regulation of the protection of life by homicide laws in this particular connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.197" offset="1568705">And therefore, state law with regard to homicide is set aside but in setting aside the state law is not governmental action," he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.716" offset="1614785">You could do the same thing as reference to kidnapping laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.842" offset="1627324">Let's say that the Congress authorized, permitted the unions to imprison anyone who refused to join.Would his liberty be deprived to taken away by governmental action?</text>
            <text syncTime="418.637" offset="1674449">Mr. Schoene would say, no, duly private.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.259" offset="1688973">The statute is merely permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.004" offset="1699944">And under his theory, if Congress wanted to, Congress could say that not withstanding State, FEPC laws, Congress may enact the statute providing that railroads for any employer and unions may validly contract that no Negro be employed, not withstanding the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.372" offset="1817391">It merely preempts the field the Negro's rights are not being impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.048" offset="1840170">There's no governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.576" offset="1846230">It's -- it's purely private action.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.934" offset="1859709">Or if the Congress wanted to turn the other way and say, we will say that yellow-dog contracts may be made legally either by the union members, written association will be taken away but we're not -- we're not saying that employers and employees must execute such contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.601" offset="1970364">We're not making it mandatory, it's purely permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.150" offset="1984575">And therefore, no governmental action were merely preempting the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.263" offset="2009025">Well, the cases decided by this Court are so numerous and so clear on this subject of governmental action that I don't -- I know I don't have time to review them, if in the few moments that I have left I would like say this though with regard to Section 211.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.722" offset="2102857">It has two aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.075" offset="2112261">One, I've called the passive permission aspect and that it's a mere repeal of the former prohibitions of the Railway Labor Act, former prohibition of the union shop contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.966" offset="2171820">In that respect, it's similar to the Wagner Act and the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.541" offset="2190106">Those Acts did not authorize in any affirmative sense, union shop contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.997" offset="2215915">They merely contained the proviso making it clear that they did not prohibit them.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.361" offset="2241411">In that sense, they were to pass a permission and in that connection because of the citation by Mr. Schoene of the Colgate case and some others.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.752" offset="2286968">I will say that those cases did not involve any constitutional question because none was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.118" offset="2312464">It was merely an absence of prohibition that was involved there, merely a matter of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.678" offset="2338691">But here, in Section 211, for the first time, Congress has reached out and affirmatively authorized the unions to impose union shop contracts on an entire industry, notwithstanding state law to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.797" offset="2415177">That's an entirely new -- new situation and --</text>

          <turn speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="609.337" stopTime="617.666">
            <label>Justice Stanley Reed</label>
            <text syncTime="609.337" offset="2437329">Do you think there's a difference between this Railway Labor Act and the National Labor Relations Board in this respect?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edson_smith" startTime="617.666" stopTime="736.203">
            <label>Mr. Edson Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="617.666" offset="2470661">Oh, very definitely, the National Labor Relations Act which is, of course, the Wagner Act has amended by the Taft-Hartley Act has merely a proviso there in -- Section 8 (a) (3) which makes it clear that Congress did not intend to prohibit union shop contracts of the sort that are there described in -- except for that proviso, the provision of the statute which makes it illegal for an employer to discriminate against an employee by reason of union or nonunion membership, would prohibit union shop contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.224" offset="2676820">So, it is necessary to put in the proviso to make it clear that they were not being prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.991" offset="2699912">But here, in the Railway Labor Act, for the first time in history, Congress has reached out and said we affirmatively authorized the languages.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.431" offset="2737633">They shall be permitted, notwithstanding state law to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.030" offset="2764069">And so, in two cases, one of which is now before this Court on petition for certiorari, the Weeks and Jensen cases decided by the federal courts out in California, the other, the Otten case decided by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.354" offset="2837316">Those cases coming up from States where the -- there were no right to work acts where under the common law in the state union closed shop contracts were considered permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.079" offset="2892278">Those courts held that only the -- what I've called the passive permission aspect of Section 211 who was involved, it was a mere repeal pro tanto of the former prohibition and of --</text>

            <text syncTime="784.730" offset="3138873">It does permit them in the sense of not prohibiting them but the Railway Labor Act goes farther.</text>

            <text syncTime="851.904" offset="3407517">I am saying that in this case, we can rely solely on the affirmative authorization in the -- in Section 211 itself as providing the governmental action necessary to entitle my clients to invoke the protection of the First and Fifth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.799" offset="3499154">In other words, where Congress says union shop contract shall be permitted and thereby, the statute becomes an essential ingredient -- ingredient in the process of taking away my clients rights, then that is governmental action in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.355" offset="3589329">Now, there is no such provision in the Nation Labor Relations Act and of course a union shop contracts in industry covered by the National Labor Relations Act are not lawful in Nebraska.</text>

            <text syncTime="1030.674" offset="4122645">For instance, the Railway Labor Act gives the labor unions the right to bargain for all of the members of the craft or class.</text>

            <text syncTime="1079.645" offset="4318563">Nebraska has vital interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.326" offset="4337267">It is a law which was written into our Constitution by direct act of the people and without legislative intervention that is under attack here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.837" offset="4395259">Consequently, we asked (Inaudible) to appear here in oral argue -- argue orally and greatly appreciate the opportunity that you have given us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.093" offset="4444369">There are 17 other States who have industry, constitutional amendment or legislative enactment, task laws which are similar to the Nebraska law here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.110" offset="4508421">Several of the -- these States have written separate briefs as amicus curiae and some have joined with us and some have joined in other briefs where Mr. Shepperd, the Attorney General of Texas that's had some joinder in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.181" offset="4584699">I believe there are total of 10 States now who appear here by brief and I would like to appeal that in presenting this case, I've presented not only in behalf of the State of Nebraska but all other States who have similar laws and even though States who do not, have not as yet, enacted such laws who may wish to do so at some future time and may not wish to be hampered if that time should come.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.477" offset="4697861">The constitutionality of our Nebraska law has been upheld by this Court in the case of Lincoln Federal Labor Union versus Northwestern Iron and Metal Company, 335 U.S. 525.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.597" offset="4762331">We feel that the -- the duty that is imposed upon a State here to protect, to preserve the life and liberty of these people and protect their property is a vital importance to us and is a question that is presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.639" offset="4834534">The first thing, of course, that must be determined is whether or not there is governmental action involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.917" offset="4863582">Supreme Court in Nebraska held that there was and they -- they said that discharge of an employee pursuant to a union shop agreement that's expressly authorized by Section 211 would unconstitutionally deprive him of his right to work, a freedom of association guaranteed by the First and Fifth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.028" offset="4960026">On arriving, its -- its conclusion, the Supreme Court of Nebraska recognized that Section 211 is not a mere repeal of the provisions of the Railway Labor Act which prohibited all forms of compulsory union is, but that the union shop amendment does far more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.081" offset="5056261">It affirmatively authorizes the union shop and strikes down all present and prospective conflicting federal and state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.386" offset="5101505">So, in determining whether or not governmental action is involved, we can't consider the -- the amendment law but we must consider it in relation to the entire Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.887" offset="5159497">It's because of congressional action that the unions have gained the power that they have today and have the economic strengths which make it possible for them to impose the union shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.123" offset="5224490">And because of the power that Congress has given to the labor unions, their actions are no longer private but are governmental actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.842" offset="5275272">Now, that was recognized in the Steele case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.022" offset="5296065">Mr. Schoene stated that that is not in authority here because the -- the Steele case involved racial discrimination and that is not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.991" offset="5339951">But we have discrimination merely upon a different ground, a discrimination against nonunion members against members who do not wish to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.901" offset="5403585">So, we have a government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.344" offset="5421349">Here, of the highest degree, and it's interesting to note that on this question, the amicus brief written here on behalf of the CIAF -- CIO organization, they take the entirely of the opposite stand, page 5 of their brief where they came up and emphatically say that we agree that there is Government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.259" offset="5521032">They go on to say that indeed to find governmental action in the union shop amendment is not necessary to look to its effect in ousting conflicting state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.112" offset="5560424">The amendment is part of the general regulatory scheme of the Railway Labor Act and it has never been doubted that that statute is governmental action and that its provisions must therefore meet the requirements of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.993" offset="5619879">Now, we agree with the brief written by that organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.299" offset="5637120">There -- there can be no pretense here that it isn't the Act of Congress that's being placed into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.823" offset="5663242">In fact, the answer here of the appellant unions expressly states that the agreements are lawfully entered into, pursuant to the prohibitions of Section 211 of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.888" offset="5735549">In effect, of course, the union shop -- the amendment repeals certain federal laws including the Sections Fourth and Fifth of the Railway Labor Act which embodied the freedom to join or not to join labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.929" offset="5815693">So, Congress here has foreclosed and prevented the States, their legislator, their executives and administrative officers from acting with reference to our own state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.873" offset="5875461">Now, this is -- that is certainly a mandatory and affirmative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.961" offset="5895837">It's far more than a mere repeal of the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.189" offset="5916735">Congress doesn't have the power to repeal a state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.346" offset="5933349">They do, in certain instances, have authority to supersede those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.851" offset="5955396">But certainly, when we're talking about the question of whether or not Government action exists, when they -- Congress attempts to supersede state laws, it is affirmative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.063" offset="6008163">So, it seems to me that it's -- it's just fantastic to even suggest that Government action is not in -- involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.072" offset="6048287">Congress has given here the unions the help that they requested in order to have a compulsory union shop throughout the entire railway industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.563" offset="6106175">Also, in doing this, Congress purported to act under the Commerce Clause and regulation under the Commerce Clause is certainly Government action and affirmative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.708" offset="6182766">So, with that issue, as appears to me, just conclusively decided, we -- we then have to test this Act with reference to the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.257" offset="6252983">So, it -- it has been mentioned here but briefly, I just wish to point this out here that it's not a mere matter here of coming in and joining a labor organization for the purpose of collecting bargaining that's involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.249" offset="6332918">But all dues, assessments, except fines and penalties, are required to be paid by the individual regardless of whether he desires to do so or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.726" offset="6390805">He's being forced to join into a fraternal order, an insurance society and a political and economic movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.256" offset="6440960">For example, the applications required uniformly provide that the applicant will adhere to and abide by all of the rules and edicts of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.633" offset="6506475">One of the provisions, which I think you find universally through this application, is that he would not affiliate with any other conflicting order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.792" offset="6547122">In other words, any other labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.730" offset="6562900">There have been -- Mr. Smith has mentioned here political movements, religious movements and economic movements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.201" offset="6608771">Now, what is the non-member required to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.001" offset="6639909">He is required to join and he is required to support these movements whether he believes in them or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.595" offset="6678361">For example, the -- one of the provisions of the International Association of Machinists, which is in this record, provides that no inferior federal judge, so set aside a law of Congress on the ground that it's unconstitutional, and that if this Court decides and enacted Congress is unconstitutional or by interpretation undertakes to assert a public policy at variance with the statutory declaration of Congress, which alone, under our system, is authorized to determine the public policies of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.092" offset="6828304">The Congress, thereby re-passing that law nullify the action of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.826" offset="6851291">Thereafter, the law is to remain enforced and in fact precisely the same as though the Court had never held it to be unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2318.513" offset="9273992">The freedom of association, the right to work, the taking of due property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.033" offset="9332088">All are rights that are involved here and all are being assured to the individual through our right to work law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.219" offset="9376810">Now, it is always had been the duty of the State to protect its citizens, its life, liberty and pursuit of happiness and to protect them in their property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.841" offset="9427278">That's what the States are attempting to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.257" offset="9440967">Now, a law, therefore, that does no more than that, that does no more than to assure to the individual the rights which have been guaranteed to him under the Constitution, under the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.770" offset="9507004">How can such an Act be struck down by an Act of Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.710" offset="9554756">The -- these basic rights which our Court considered as the -- the issue here which made this Act of Congress unconstitutional, I think the -- the statement of Judge Wenke there can't -- I can't state it any better than to just read that quote from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.391" offset="9685473">We also think the right to work is one of the most precious liberties that man possesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.233" offset="9704908">Man has much right to work as he has to live to be free to own property or to join a church of his own choice for without freedom to work, the others would soon disappear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2474.363" offset="9897378">And they went on to consider the purpose, the motive fact of this Act which is admittedly for the purpose of eliminating the free writer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.388" offset="9973551">And -- and there, they said, we can find no condition to have existed at the time the amendment was adopted to authorize any restriction of these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.551" offset="10010122">Consequently, we think Congress was without authority to impose upon employees or railroads in Nebraska contrary to our Constitution and statutory provisions the requirement that they must become members of a union representing their craft or class as a condition for a continued employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.014" offset="10083997">It improperly -- improperly burdens a right to work and infringes upon their freedoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.506" offset="10110015">This is particularly true as to the latter because it is apparent that some of these labor organizations advocate political ideas, support political candidates and advance national ecomanic concepts which may or may not be of an employee's choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.199" offset="10188696">Now, none -- none of the -- those statements have been challenged here by either the appellants or their amici.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.705" offset="10226730">And I think it's -- it can be conceded here that the purpose, the whole -- whole purpose of this law was to eliminate the free writer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.899" offset="10275527">Property rights are guaranteed by the state right to work law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.431" offset="10309695">Contract rights, of course, are property right and the statement in Yick Wo versus Hopkins that the very idea that one man may be compelled to hold his life for the means of living or any material right essential to the enjoyment of life at the mere will of another, seems to be intolerable in any country where freedom prevails as being the very essence of slavery itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.491" offset="10433933">Now, we feel that it is the duty of the State to protect these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.139" offset="10456503">Article I Section 1 of the Constitution of the State of Nebraska provides that all persons are by nature free and independent and have certain inherent and unalienable rights, among these are light liberty and a pursuit of happiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.814" offset="10519197">To secure these rights and the protection of property, Governments are instituted among people to deriving their just power from the consent of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.091" offset="10560261">A similar provisions may be found, I think in the Constitutions of all of the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.315" offset="10589205">Article X of the Bill of Rights, the Federal Constitution provides the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution or prohibited by it to the States I reserve to the States respectively or to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.502" offset="10645943">It's under this reserved power that the people of the State of Nebraska and that these other States have initiated the laws for the purpose of protecting the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.564" offset="10722220">There is nothing here under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution which can possibly justify this congressional action, while under the Commerce Clause, Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce but is not had unlimited power and must be exercised within the bounds laid out by other provisions of the Constitution and principally, the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.396" offset="10881567">The guarantees of the Bill of Rights, as stated in the case of West Virginia State Board of Education versus Barnette in 319 U.S. 624, these rights should only be susceptible to restriction to prevent grave and immediate danger to interest which the Government is obligated to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.000" offset="10975922">Therefore, we sincerely feel that Congress here debar exceeded any authority that they had to -- in -- in their attempt here to strike down the laws of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.527" offset="11038093">There's one other point that I -- I want to mention here, my time is about out, and that is that we do not, the Illinois, when I say "we", I'm speaking for all of the States who have this right to work laws that these laws are anti-union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.911" offset="11107579">But on the contrary, I firmly believe that such laws are absolutely essential to the survival of labor unions particularly in lieu of the power given to them by the laws of the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.348" offset="11157316">Mr. Justice Brandeis, of course he was a supporter of unionism in a letter to Lincoln Steffens which Mr. Justice Frankfurter quoted in the opinion of the American Federation of Labor versus American Sash and Door Company case which is a companion case to the -- to the Nebraska case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.373" offset="11241430">It was argued here at the same time in which he stated, “But the American people should not and will not accept unionism if it involves a closed shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.774" offset="11291063">They will not consent to the exchange of the tyranny of the employer for the tyranny of the employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.982" offset="11315827">And later, on he went out to sum this up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.132" offset="11332441">It is not true that the success of the labor union necessarily means perfect monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.455" offset="11353757">The Union, in order to obtain and preserve for its members industrial liberty, must be strong and stable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.993" offset="11379879">It need not include any member of the trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.714" offset="11390851">Indeed, it is desirable both -- for both the employer and the Union that -- that it should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.692" offset="11410704">Absolute power leads to excesses and to witnesses, either our character nor our intelligence can long bear this grave among restricted power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.256" offset="11460963">Now, we -- we believe that that is a correct statement, that is the attitude that people of our states have -- have taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.904" offset="11507566">They have taken the position that union members and union leaders are no different than in any other individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.662" offset="11538599">They're not incapable of -- of making errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.395" offset="11549571">They have the same weaknesses and frailties in everyone else that they're -- they, as well as, officials in government must have some restriction and that voluntary unionism is the most effective means of maintaining this democratic control over our labor unions which have become such a vital part of our lives in this nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.788" offset="11683109">I think I have only a few minutes left, Mr. Chief Justice, but I have only a few very brief comments to make directed entirely to a matter of clarification as to what has been said regarding my position on the so-called question of governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.987" offset="11771925">If you examine my brief, you will find the -- that term not used anywhere because, I think, in reference to this sort of context, it is ambiguous and confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.264" offset="11821035">Obviously, I have never taken the position and would not be so absurd as to take the position that the enactment of Section 211 to the Railway Labor Act by Congress or the enactment of any other part of the Railway Labor Act by Congress was not governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.770" offset="11891043">The problem here is, what does the governmental action consist of and it consists entirely of the enactment of that section of the Railway Labor Act and the other provisions of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.712" offset="11946841">Now, to when to strike the significance of that, all the cases that have been cited here by the appellees concerning the depravation of particular rights such as rights to work, rights of freedom to -- to associate, all arise out of situations where the legislative authority, either state or federal, has its self proscribe the right and said, “You shall not work unless you shall -- you could form the certain condition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.824" offset="12067213">So, you shall not associate unless you conformed a certain condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.947" offset="12087693">Now, the relevance of all those cases depends upon the governmental action here, namely, the enactment of permissive authority to make contracts as being the equivalent of prescribing the terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.207" offset="12156761">And my point is simply that does not follow anymore than you test the validity of negotiated wage rights under the Railway Labor Act in the same way that you would test the validity of prescribed wage rights set forth in a congressional statute.</text>
