            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="7.746" offset="30929">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.875" offset="39497">I had just made the argument that the California decision violates the policy of the National Labor Relations Act because it says that certain employees, namely, employees who were Communist may not have the protection of a collective-bargaining agreement or the protection of the union benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.360" offset="149420">Where as, of course, the Act doesn't exclude those employees from those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.350" offset="181394">Now the N.A.M. brief has raised the point of which neither the petitioner nor the respondent had briefed in their brief that if that is the case, then, they say it may will be that the arbitration award to its void for lack of jurisdiction and that the whole case was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board relying on the Garner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.431" offset="301662">That's the big subject in itself which has not been briefed by either side if he desires a brief on that subject, we will, of course, be glad to supply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.565" offset="346175">But I think it -- it may be enough if I just point out the following factors, showing that the Garner rule doesn't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.860" offset="387344">In the first place, the arbitration procedure could stand or has an independent ground of jurisdiction other than the question of discharge for union membership and that is because one of the issues was whether the discharge was not for just cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.736" offset="458919">In the second place, the limitations on state and events with regards to picketing or strike activity or secondary boycott activity shouldn't and don't apply to oust state remedies for violations of a collective-bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.613" offset="542407">On the contrary, that would frustrate the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.280" offset="569051">The fundamental purpose of the Act is to promote collective-bargaining which, if it is successful, culminates in a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.520" offset="606041">Now, if this contract then can't be enforced by the ordinary remedy, then, this purpose is largely frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.783" offset="647105">And in fact, it is standard union company dealings that when you do have a contract, it is customary to have the provisions against discharges without just cause and discharges for union activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.802" offset="719203">As a matter of fact, the conference report on the Taft-Hartley Act says and I'm quoting now, “Once parties have made a collective-bargaining contract, the enforcement of that contract should be left to the usual processes of the law and not to the National Labor Relations Board.”</text>
            <text syncTime="198.274" offset="793078">And if you look at Section 203 (d) of the Taft-Hartley Act, that's the section dealing with the Federal Mediation Service, there's an expressed statement that adjustment of labor disputes by a method agreed upon by the parties is the desirable method for settling grievance disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.426" offset="873639">And again Congress showed their intention to have traditional contractual remedies applied through the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.060" offset="900180">Once the collective-bargaining contract had been entered into by expanding a federal court jurisdiction so as to permit suits against labor unions under Section 301 of the Act without regard to diversity and not the controversy and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.616" offset="970397">In other words, the Act shows that there is a policy of the Act in favor of utilizing traditional state remedies, traditional judicial remedies for enforcement of collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.009" offset="1031941">And as a matter of fact, recognizing this fact, the Labor Board itself has established a policy of refusing the process cases involving alleged discharges for union activity where there is a collective-bargaining contract with a binding arbitration procedure available as there was here, so that the alleged discharged union activity could be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.078" offset="1144268">As I say we haven't briefed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.871" offset="1151478">I would therefore like to cite a note which does cover the subject and does give the -- the Labor Board decisions that I have just referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.711" offset="1194841">It's a note that 69 Harvard Law Review beginning at page 725.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.106" offset="1220336">Now there is one other respect in which the California decision engaged a federally occupied field.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.736" offset="1262864">The Internal Security Act, the constitutionality of which among other things is now pending and -- and it's under consideration by this Court as the Court is aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.519" offset="1314064">That Act prohibits members of a Communist action organization from holding employment in defense facilities designated by the Secretary of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.369" offset="1361398">Now the California court has gone beyond that Act and it has excluded Communist from employment in nondefense facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.898" offset="1399536">But if there's a greater conflict and inconsistency than that, in the Internal Security Act, Congress expressly provided that the employment exclusion sanction should be withheld until the registration order of the Board against the Communist Party became final by affirmance by this Court if this Court have does affirmed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.049" offset="1492114">And it allowed an escape opportunity for a member of the Communist Party to get out of the employment sanction by leaving the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.227" offset="1524820">But it was very careful to allow this state opportunity to exist after all judicial review had been exhausted in the Communist Party case.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.981" offset="1571840">Now, the Court may remember that that fact, the fact that there was an escape opportunity allowed after all judicial review was exhausted, was relied on very heavily in the oral argument in the Communist Party case.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.280" offset="1633071">Why the Solicitor General as saying that this preserves the constitutionality of the Act because it means that a Communist without guilty knowledge are in subject to the employment sanction of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.053" offset="1696183">But the California court, in this decision, purporting to apply a policy which it derived in part from the Internal Security Act has applied the employment sanction without allowing that opportunity for escape because that opportunity for escape after this Court affirms if it does, still hasn't arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.337" offset="1805270">And this particular plant, Cutter Laboratories, for all anybody knows, may or may not be eventually be designated as a defense facility by the Secretary of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.516" offset="1858038">That the Secretary of Defense simply has not designated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.042" offset="1872144">So far as I am aware, the list of defense facilities from which members of Communist action organization are excluded by virtue of the Internal Security Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gardiner Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="496.234" offset="1984888">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.371" offset="2001398">In the presentation of the case for the respondent, I shall devote my portion of the time of the subject to the order of the Court in discussing primarily the factual situation and my colleague Mr. Stanton will discuss some of the legal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.460" offset="2085825">I might say we are familiar with the Court's attitude on divided argument and I hope that I consider the Court that I am prepared to discuss any legal questions that might arise, but a unique situation has been presented here, we think, has disclosed by petitioners argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.442" offset="2161685">Because as they have pointed out with differences here between the parties are primarily, I'm careful to say primarily, differences as to the facts and the findings rather than as to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.315" offset="2229185">I want to be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.975" offset="2235873">We do not agree with many of the statements that we believe to be enthusiastic statements by counsel on what the decisions have held, but we do not differ in the name with the legal principles that he has stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.883" offset="2299507">We simply say that he is talking about another case and not the one that was tried on the arbitration proceedings in the Sir Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco, not the one that the arbitrators decided, not the case of the California Supreme Court has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.174" offset="2372650">But again, I would be clear, our position is not that he argues the facts to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.435" offset="2405669">As we view the record, they walk around them.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.614" offset="2422387">They don't dispute the facts that supported the arbitrators award.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.607" offset="2438374">They don't even mentioned them.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.888" offset="2447464">They blatantly ignore them and then having done so, they say they don't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.843" offset="2475363">Rather than arguing myself, I would turn to their brief and demonstrate what I mean by a couple of references and I hope where he pointed once.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.382" offset="2517473">For instance in the beginning, at page 6 of -- of their brief, they discuss this question of the facts and here is what they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.810" offset="2567210">This is the -- the green brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.170" offset="2584660">In the middle of the page, we assume that this Court, likewise, will not review the merits of the factual findings of the arbitrators or have they stop there, we would agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.287" offset="2633143">But in the same breath, having said they are not going to argue the factual findings, they go on with this astonishing statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.866" offset="2667416">However, the majority of the court below in vacating the arbitrator's award, apparently treated certain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.310" offset="2701166">I emphasis that.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.762" offset="2707017">Certain language of the arbitrators as a finding that the discharged employee was personally dedicated to sabotage force, violence, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.909" offset="2743589">A conclusion which distorts the actual holding of the arbitrators and which is entirely without evidentiary support.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.625" offset="2774413">Now may I point out that they choose from that point on to call the finding which was read and I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked, “What are you quoting from?”</text>
            <text syncTime="703.491" offset="2813910">They choose from this point on to call it not a finding but in their language certain evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.906" offset="2843585">I submit to the Court and -- and welcome a careful checking of the record that if that portion was read, if that is not a finding, then, there are no findings in this case either by the arbitration board or by the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.937" offset="2907742">It was clearly a finding that because counsel to -- to argue the legal points that they make here must build a false structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.907" offset="2943582">They don't call it a finding, they call it a certain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.903" offset="2963540">They do so again on page 26 and page 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.435" offset="2989662">Basically the same point, it's right under subsection (h), and I think it's worth quoting because it points out better than my argument can and this is what their position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.133" offset="3044519">This is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.249" offset="3048908">We pointed out above that the findings of the arbitrators, they call them findings there and the evidence in the record strongly negate any notion that the arbitrators regarded Mrs. Walker as in any case a sabotage risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.215" offset="3108780">Now let me stop there and say, as you will note carefully that they call it findings and they call it evidence in the record when they say that it negates any finding that she was committed to sabotage.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.249" offset="3156950">But if you will please follow me, they then go on in the next sentence and say, indeed, the very award itself ordering her reinstatement to her previous job is the best evidence of the lack of any such belief from the arbitrators' part, and then the astounding thing is, they proceed immediately to quote it and it says exactly what they said it doesn't say.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.030" offset="3244095">Because they go on and say and now they are on our side so they come back to certain language instead of findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.696" offset="3270740">They say, however, certain language used in the arbitration decision is erroneously treated by the company and apparently by the court below as a finding the Mrs. Walker was personally dedicated to sabotage force, violence, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.533" offset="3338031">And because it is vital, may I reread it and point out that I am not reading from the minority arbitrators award as filed by Mr. (Inaudible) who dissented, “I am not arguing anything based on his finding because I take it I am completely precluded from that, although, they don't grant the same respect to the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.834" offset="3431236">I am taking the minority award and here is specifically what they said as it is set forth in the award which is found in the front of the transcript at page 29 and I'm going to read it from the transcript rather from the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.169" offset="3564669">Beginning at the top of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.633" offset="3574491">And now, may I call the Court's attention the fact that having stated certain preliminary introductory subjects, the arbitrators are now in subjects numbered first, second and so on, and obviously, these are the findings and this is the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.617" offset="3634364">The company maintains that the basis for the discharge was two-fold as goes to Mr. Justice Reed's question, two fold, the emissions and falsification on the application for employment and membership on the Communist Party with the full implications of dedication to sabotage force violence and the like which party membership is believe to entail.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.400" offset="3737600">And here is the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.166" offset="3744601">The finding that the company honestly believe all of these things as admitted and the accuracy of those beliefs as established in the record as follows by admission with respect to the emissions and falsifications on the application for employment by undenied and uncontradicted evidence with respect to the membership and the party -- Communist Party and by uncontradicted evidence, that the company's beliefs about the full implications of party membership were prevalently understood and is shared.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.409" offset="3869571">In this view of the record and we take this view, we are unable to find that the company has been denied a fair hearing by reason of our refusal to instruct Doris Walker to answer questions put to her touching this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.650" offset="3950550">They seem to assume that that is to be shrug off and disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.792" offset="3983151">They call it not a finding but certain language.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.397" offset="4869538">The record shows without any possible question something that I think has seldom improved American trials involving Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.516" offset="4914051">I am aware that in the Dennis case, Mr. Justice Jackson commented about the Communist Party as follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.915" offset="5067651">What we have done to aid the arbitrators was to put in a handwritten document which is this three-page letter in the appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="1283.588" offset="5134315">So, we had it photostat or photo list in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.788" offset="5267122">And to further illustrate it, there are -- there is another application which we eventually got from a cannery which is immediately behind the three-page letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.338" offset="5949336">Dated July 10, 1946, I made the following statement to Lloyd today and at my request that he transmit it to the State, he suggested I write it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.863" offset="5999386">After my discussions with Lloyd and Carol, Monday morning July 8, I gave a lot of thought to the points they raise concerning the resolution on the maritime strike introduced into the Cannery Workers Club which is identified as a Communist Party sell among the cannery workers by Elsie Smith in May.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.673" offset="6078589">Now, this is the significant part, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.579" offset="6090292">I tried to evaluate my action as I try to evaluate whatever I do from the point of view of the welfare of the working class on the strengthening of the Party, with a capital P.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.524" offset="6142015">What had struck me particularly in the discussion where Charles points as to the limited nature of our information, the daily papers including the PW, which is identified as the People's World, the official Communist Party paper in San Francisco and the irresponsibility implied by introducing a resolution based on such limited information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.981" offset="6231876">I feel that had I not been so much on the defensive during the discussion, I would have admitted my error at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.015" offset="6259984">As it was, I spent two days and much of two nights thinking through what I had done and came to the conclusion that we have introduced such a resolution under my club did not meet my test and was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.172" offset="6316617">As a member of a club remote from the maritime situation and with no special information to have introduced the resolution was irresponsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.903" offset="6351517">I want to make it clear that I had reached this position independently and before I talked to Elsie Smith yesterday, after I told her how my thinking was going, she told me that she agreed in substance and had already told the county so, which means the Alameda County authority signed Doris Brin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.614" offset="6430407">Now in the record, Lloyd and Carol are definitely identified as Lloyd Laymon and Carol Barnes both top Communist Party functionaries in Alameda County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.650" offset="6482547">They are the people with whom she has discussed this meeting or this letter it she says on the morning -- the morning of July the 8th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.782" offset="6527060">The person who wrote that letter has a remarkable educational background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.894" offset="6567497">One question has been asked to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.506" offset="6573976">None of these has come forth in the argument of the petitioners, but may I just review this woman's -- this young lady's educational record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.638" offset="6610547">In doing so, I want to confess that somewhere in this record, there is an American tragedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.508" offset="6645969">It's not for me to decide and I think that this Court can't, but here is a girl who graduated from UCLA in 1939 with honors in English, a member of Phi Beta Kappa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.058" offset="6696229">She went to the University of California Berkley, the law school which I insert another people prominent in Washington attended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.518" offset="6726008">She was not only graduated with an LLB in 1942 but she was a member of the Editorial Board of the California Law Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.082" offset="6764251">And yet she graduated, as the record shows in May 1942 and by June the 3rd, she did two significant things on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.802" offset="6795180">She joined the Communist Party, became a card carrying member and she went to work for the OPA in San Francisco as an enforcement attorney where she stayed for some two years beginning on the salary of $1800 as the record shows and going up to $3200.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.894" offset="6887549">Now, in addition to that, this young lady had practiced law in San Francisco before she came to Cutter Laboratories and the record shows that, and she doesn't deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.201" offset="6940735">She admitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.411" offset="6945541">She had practiced law with the firm of Gladstein, Grossman, Sawyer, and Margolis prior to her Cutter employment for less than a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.714" offset="6986815">Then she had gone to the canneries where there was labor strike between the teamsters and the food tobacco and agricultural workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.170" offset="7020669">First she end up on the picket line representing herself as being a union representative and finding apparently that she was ineffective there, she actually got into the plants and stood in the line cutting asparagus and cutting spinach, a member of the State Bar of California, because I omitted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.344" offset="7109277">She was admitted to the State Bar of California on December the 8th of 1942.</text>

            <text syncTime="1818.699" offset="7274789">But I might say that the -- the misrepresentations that she made to our client in filing out the application blank are certainly direct violations of the State Bar Act of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.236" offset="7328914">Because as it's demonstrated in the record, the -- the second document which I called your attention to, this application of the Cutter Laboratories is a complete fabrication.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.483" offset="7393907">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.912" offset="7395579">That the way we found that out was on the first investigation in 1947 but we couldn't run down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.439" offset="7425672">The company was unable to run down these references that she gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.397" offset="7437584">One of them is a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.927" offset="7447615">Mr. McTurnan who is referred to in that document as a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.272" offset="7460989">She admitted under oath that she called him and told him that she had given him as a reference as she did the other reference and that she had asked him not to disclose her legal background or training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.797" offset="7511144">He knew it because it was his brother John Trippe McTurnan under whom she had worked at the OPA and it is John Trippe McTurnan whose name -- she has cut the family name off in her application and she list John Trippe as her former employer in checking the state bar records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.764" offset="7587004">Eventually it was rundown by checking the McTurnans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.209" offset="7600797">We stumbled on to the fact that there were two, and one was Francis and one was John Trippe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.983" offset="7619918">And at the hearing, she admitted that's what she did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.800" offset="7631099">Now I'm not arguing her State Bar violation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.632" offset="7642488">I take it that will be handled in due course by other authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.751" offset="7658998">That's not part of my case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.306" offset="7665162">But I did want to make it clear that I think without any question, her action in misrepresenting completely her record is a direct and unquestioned violation of the State Bar Act of any of the states, but you are quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.351" offset="7733394">The conduct that I referred to practicing law now does not violate our state law unless she is still carrying on the conspiracy that we think that she was proved -- proved to have been carrying on during her employment and our plan and if she's doing that, I think she is violating the -- I don't think that the law of California expressly so states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.094" offset="7820330">Now, this is the -- this is the type of person who sought employment in three canneries and then came to Cutter Laboratories and became first as has been said a label clerk and then took on some minor curricular activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.230" offset="7908833">We asked during the hearing a number of questions but may I say first that they -- they who now say that they've had no trial, the parties who complained that -- that this is taking away due process because they haven't had a hearing, they tried at the arbitration board's hearing is to stop us before we ever got started.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.970" offset="7999843">We had asked the collateral question about the law firm that she'd been working for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.324" offset="8021264">Specifically the question was, “When you took employment there, did you know that they were the attorneys for the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.189" offset="8048744">Admittedly a collateral question, she refused to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.699" offset="8062746">The record shows that there was a long conference about it and that eventually a ruling was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.750" offset="8094929">The basic ruling strangely was made on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.490" offset="8109871">And that the arbitrators, at that point, indicated that they were not going to compel of her to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.756" offset="8139024">They found that the issue of Communist Party membership and activity was relevant, that it was part of the issues of the hearing, that they said we are not going to compel her to answer because if we do, you, meaning to employer, will go to Court and have recited and this arbitration will bug down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.259" offset="8216973">So we were compelled to proceed without any compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.806" offset="8239125">What happened was that Mr. Edises, the Attorney for the petitioner, tried to get us to accept a stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.755" offset="8274965">He tried to get us to stipulate that he would concede everything that was pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.804" offset="8311118">He said so in -- in those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.013" offset="8332016">We decline to accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.373" offset="8345391">We stated that the good faith of the management was not the issue, but we were entitled to prove the Communist Party and communist activity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.144" offset="8396487">So we went ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.143" offset="8404532">Eventually, Mr. Edises stated his position that we were persecuting the young lady.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.915" offset="8455628">Now, I emphasize this because their complaint here is that they have not had a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.390" offset="8493558">To the contrary, they took the position at the hearing that we had gone further than we were required to or entitled to that we have proved everything that was at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.638" offset="8550504">And eventually, Mr. Edises stated that we were not going to prove Mrs. Walker to be a Communist and he said bluntly because I am not going to allow you to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.995" offset="8615915">I would like to read that from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.778" offset="8631066">I would call the Court's attention, page 139 and 140.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.113" offset="8676415">At the bottom of the page, Mr. Edises is speaking and this is what he says,"They are not going to prove in this arbitration proceeding and they could not prove whether she is a Communist or not because I am not going to permit her to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.583" offset="8746318">Therefore, all they could do would be to bring in evidence showing that they had some basis for their suspicions for their beliefs and that is all it could come out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.202" offset="8784771">You could not even make a finding on that issue in this posture of the case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.202" offset="8804728">And then here's his offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.873" offset="8811416">“In order to expedite this hearing and to defend what is a principal position as far as Mrs. Walker is concerned, we are willing to make a concession of everything that they could possibly prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.284" offset="8857078">We are willing to make a concession of everything that they could possibly prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.681" offset="8878707">And anything further, I submit, goes beyond the necessities of proof and actually gets on to species of persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.821" offset="8919249">I am not quoting anyone but the attorney for the petitioner at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.826" offset="8943282">We persisted to the arbitration board that we are entitled to put our questions and to proceed to prove the issue and eventually we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.939" offset="8983719">The questions which are -- were not asked are set out in one position, they are accumulated at pages 49 to 69 of the -- of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.252" offset="9032934">The reason being that we collated them to present them to the Superior Court, and they are all collected together at those pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.890" offset="9067520">They appear throughout the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.245" offset="9088940">They appear, for instance, at page 163 to 173.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.175" offset="9108689">The questions concerning Exhibit 6, the party line confession appear at pages 192 to 197.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.563" offset="9154247">None of them answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.469" offset="9157799">Even though laboriously, we went through the document and asked her every possible question concerning each individual fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.841" offset="9195311">The questions concerning Exhibits 6, 22 and 23 appear at pages 423 to 444.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.232" offset="9236898">In that connection, I would call the Court's attention to the fact that Exhibits 22 and 23, as they appear at page -- pages 70 and 71 set forth rather detailed items listing official party offices that she had held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.589" offset="9342328">They referred to individual facts concerning her party record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.185" offset="9360718">Her card number is given on the date when it was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.575" offset="9374198">She was questioned concerning all of those items and of course refused to answer any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.298" offset="9401156">Now we contend that upon that record and I want -- I want to refer to two specific questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.250" offset="9448908">At pages 442 and 443 of the transcript, she was asked directly these questions, and this appears at the bottom on page 442.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.342" offset="9509303">Mrs. Walker is testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.854" offset="9519334">Isn't it a fact that the reason why you listed those individuals and contracted this fictitious employer was because of the fact that you were a remember of the Communist Party at the time and that you desire to get into the Cutter plant in order to carry on more effectively and more actively the program and the activities of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.495" offset="9741897">Of course, she declined to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.883" offset="9741793">On the next page, we asked her specifically this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.254" offset="9741688">“Isn't it a fact and a matter of fact, Mrs. Walker, that your state of mind at that time was that you were a member of the Communist Party, that you were interesting -- interested in getting out into the field and taking a more active role in carrying on the field of activities in which you're interested and the activities of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.130" offset="9741584">And that it was for that reason that you misrepresented those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.704" offset="9754749">Now, the record demonstrates beyond any question a very interesting position, which I want to state briefly to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.423" offset="9797590">This young lady had been investigated in 1947 as the record shows because some of the women employees in the plant contended that what they denominated as Communist literature was being brought into the ladies rest room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.721" offset="9866867">The management made a check.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.073" offset="9880242">Eliminated it down to the point where one or more of about 15 people were suspected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.943" offset="9903752">And then what they did never having had this problem before, they asked the Retail Credit Association to carry on an investigation of each one of them just as they've done with some other salesmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.903" offset="9951608">Immediately, the report on this young lady or with $6 or $7 was paid came back positive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.220" offset="9980865">But the testimony shows that the executive vice president called us -- called in the attorneys and said here is the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.612" offset="10014407">Here are these facts, can we discharge this woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.782" offset="10027050">She was a union official at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.212" offset="10036767">Now I cite to this Court on the record, I think will support maybe on any question and Mr. Cutter made the statement unequivocally its in the record, that he was advised by his counsel that what you have is gossip, suspicion, name calling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.102" offset="10108343">It may lead you to believe that she is a Communist, but it is not evidence and no arbitrator will sustain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.763" offset="10138958">And on that ground, she was not discharged at that time, but they checked her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.822" offset="10159229">Incidentally, they went to the National Labor Relations Board that on June the 18th, 1947, the same day they serve the notice to open the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.737" offset="10194860">They came to us and said, “You have been putting these people under surveillance because of union activities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.650" offset="10222550">The company said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.946" offset="10231745">Surveillance, yes” admitted but not for union activities, for definite, communist activities which are suspected on the basis of these reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.247" offset="10280960">Now, the charges were dismissed although we asked for a hearing before the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.211" offset="10304784">We wanted a hearing, but the charges were dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.404" offset="10321607">So she remained in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.494" offset="10329966">Until 1949, one of the personal employees read in the Labor Herald, a CIO paper in San Francisco, a statement that $205,000 in back salary was being paid to some cannery workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.602" offset="10390361">And the concluding paragraph said that Doris Walker, her discharge, was going to be appealed because she had been fired for refusing to testify as the Communist Party membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.893" offset="10443546">Immediately upon the reading of that, the company directed us and we had investigators on that occasion, professional investigators come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.033" offset="10480118">They started of by getting the record from Mr. (Inaudible) office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.244" offset="10492970">He had been the attorney in the cannery dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.113" offset="10504359">And having that information, the record shows that from the day when they got that information on August the 23rd of 1949, that the only period elapsing was between August the 23rd and October the 5th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.137" offset="10556500">When we went over to the plant with the information which the investigators had brought in, all of this detailed information and much more than what we're able to get into the hearing, and all day was spent going over that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.652" offset="10610521">The record shows this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.000" offset="10619925">It was checked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.555" offset="10626194">It was discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.118" offset="10632464">The conclusion was reached and they're advised that this is not suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.972" offset="10651794">This is proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.298" offset="10661094">And the next day, she was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.703" offset="10674782">Now they say -- and they seem to say it seriously on the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.068" offset="10692232">That they never had any idea or suspicion that the Communist issue was part of this case until the decision of the Supreme Court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.153" offset="10728594">This record shows beyond any contradiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.215" offset="10740820">But in the very statement which was read to her, on October the 6th when she was discharged that -- that very issue was covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.352" offset="10781362">She was told in the statement which the vice president of the company read to her as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.551" offset="10810201">We are convinced now that for a number of years, you have been and still are a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.892" offset="10839562">We are convinced beyond any question that for a number of years you have participated actively in the Communist Party's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.962" offset="10871745">The nature of our company's business requires more than the usual precaution against sabotage and subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.109" offset="10900376">Upon a disclosure that any employee is a member of the Communist Party or has participated in other subversive or revolutionary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.410" offset="10937574">We conceive it to be the responsibility of management to take action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.691" offset="10954710">Confronted with such a situation, any inclination to be lenient or to grant a union official special consideration which is what the company contented it had done in 1947 is out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.917" offset="11003611">In the face of your record, there is no alternative open to us except to terminate your services at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.700" offset="11030779">Accordingly, you are notified that you are discharge for the cause as mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.370" offset="11049378">You will be paid the full amount duty properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.860" offset="11059409">Now may I carefully state that -- I mean that's at page 8 of the arbitrator's report, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.925" offset="11087621">At pages 7, 8, 9 and 10 appear the statement which the company read to her on her dismissal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.324" offset="14053251">The company's position is that the evidence in this case demonstrates beyond question that Doris Walker is not merely a conspirator but a traitor and an enemy of the country, and in the finding of the arbitrator which is made on page 29, a statement is made assuming and referring to Doris Walker's answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.640" offset="14146560">Assuming their answers would have been favorable to the company's position, they would serve no more than to corroborate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.947" offset="14171742">What we find is already established by the record and the company offers no convincing reason why further corroboration is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.690" offset="14210717">The arbitrator -- this matter that has been argued to you by petitioners here was argued before the California Supreme Court, very much at length as to the interpretation of that finding and as to its meaning and we feel that under the decision of this Court that matter has been solid for this Court because the California Supreme Court in several places, the very outset of their opinion, which is on page 469 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.758" offset="14339030">We have concluded that upon the undisputed evidence and upon the facts found by the Arbitration Board the company is correct in its contention if the arbitrators exceeded their powers that the award is contrary to law and that would contravene public policy for the court's of this state to enforce reinstatement of the discharged employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.168" offset="14424607">And there are other references in which the Court states as exact holding, but we were contending at page 478 as they start their opinion, they say as ground for reversal of the camp -- as ground for reversal, the company contends among other things and as it contended before the trial court in seeking vacation of the award that an arbitration award which directs that a member of the Communist Party who is dedicated in that party's program of sabotage, force, violence and the like, be reinstated to employment in a plant which produces antibiotics used by both the military and civilians is against public policy as expressed in both federal and state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.858" offset="14607360">Therefore, illegal and void and will not be enforced by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.337" offset="14625332">With this contention, we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.540" offset="14638080">Now what was being done in this case was the interpretation and enforcement of a state statute, a state remedy.</text>
