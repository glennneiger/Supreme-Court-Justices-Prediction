            <label>Mr. Norman M. Littell</label>
            <text syncTime="25.386" offset="101460">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.519" offset="138031">This is a case arising under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.826" offset="163213">It meets with the convenience of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.586" offset="170318">I think it can best be presented by a summary of the facts, which will necessarily involve a review of the Court proceedings in view of the rather extraordinary attack which the government counsel makes upon the prejudice of the trial judge, in fact, upon his integrity and then a statement of the issues, as we conceive them to be in our position in respect to those issues and lastly, our argument abandoning rather wide areas to the briefs of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.453" offset="333740">This case will determine whether in the face of the Tort Claims Act, the United States, acting through agents whose authority to act and perform the deeds complained of in this case are admitted -- is admitted, may, with impunity, destroy the personal property of Indian wards of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.402" offset="461531">Now, wholly without reference for the moment to the legal context in which these facts stand, they reveal what to any reasonable mind must be recognized as a shocking depredation.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.691" offset="546691">These petitioners, members of some eight Navajo Indian families, lived outside the Navajo Reservation in southeastern Utah, north of the San Juan River where they have their hogans.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.411" offset="617639">They own some 154 horses and burros.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.240" offset="636865">That portion of the public domain on which these petitioners graze their small amount of livestock was also one to permit to white livestock men for about 38,000 cattle and sheep.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.741" offset="722860">I should say that these Navajos had lived there, the words of art, the customary expression is some time immemorial, I mean, that they had lived there and their fathers and grandfathers before them as far back as we -- as we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.995" offset="783882">After the Taylor Grazing Act came into effect in 1934, these white stockmen, of course, under the usual pressures of the frontier situation, cast somewhat desires -- desiring eyes upon the grazing area which for so long had been used by the Navajo Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.900" offset="867579">But these Indians themselves were bona fide holders of an interest there, residents under the Taylor Grazing Act, bona fide residents under the Taylor Grazing Act, and were so recognized by the Bureau of Management up to 1947 for and up through that year, they held permits to graze stock in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.728" offset="966844">The white stockmen maintained constant pressure to take -- take the reins from the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.580" offset="986279">Although, at first, the Indians were given permits, as I say, they were canceled in 1947, various methods were used to remove the Indian from the range, but the purposes of this -- for the purposes of this case, of course, we stick right to the record and these may be summarized as follows - In 1950, in February of 1950, the United States Government moved into the District Court of Utah and asked for an injunction against Hosteen Sakezzie, one of the defendants -- one of the plaintiffs here, and (Inaudible) for the Navajos who inhabited that area, to compel their removal and removal of their stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.866" offset="1163389">And the District Court held they had no power to give these Indians any land.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.975" offset="1179899">He recognized their -- what we call aboriginal position there.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.948" offset="1211768">He had no power and that was an administrative problem for the Department of the Interior to find lands for them to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.644" offset="1234547">But on appeal to the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals in August of 1951 reversed him and said, “It's incumbent upon the Court to hear this case on the merits and make an order, irrespective of whether their lands, other lands, any lands to place these Indians upon.”</text>
            <text syncTime="329.421" offset="1317616">Then, there was a third case and this was a case brought by the white stockmen themselves in a perhaps somewhat more comfortable, state court of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.232" offset="1384908">And these men, including one of the principal witnesses here, (Inaudible), brought an action to the state court against a group of Navajos including some of the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.219" offset="1436839">And that Court entered an injunction against the petitioners for grazing their stock on the public domain in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.779" offset="1463066">On appeal, the Supreme Court of Utah sustained that decision, and the right to an injunction against these Indian defendants on the theory and when the Treaty of 1868 was signed by the earlier Navajo chieftains who -- or that portion of them who are in captivity at Port Sumner, they created the Navajo Reservation and the Navajos were required to return to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.684" offset="1594723">Without going into that very tempting point, let me say in passing that we regard the decision of the Supreme Court of Utah to be wholly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.044" offset="1636101">The United States was not a part of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.578" offset="1646237">The United States was the landlord.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.456" offset="1653760">The United States alone had the power to control the public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.355" offset="1673404">When the federal question does arise in the federal -- federal court that's within our opinion be differently decided and was decided in the Utah case.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.440" offset="1705691">But so much in passing, they had an injunction from the state court, confirmed with the Supreme Court of the State of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.423" offset="1737665">Now, while the proceedings, which I first mentioned, sent back from the Court of Appeals for further proceedings in the District Court were pending in the federal court against these Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.657" offset="1794612">Kinnaman, the range manager of the Bureau of Land Management, took matters into his own hands and proceeded to eliminate the stock of the petitioners from the range.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.164" offset="1856575">After the decision of the Supreme Court, and as I say, while this federal court case was still pending because it was not dismissed until June the 27th, 1953, he commenced the horse slaughter program.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.918" offset="1919582">As I should point out presently, after the program was completed and these horses had been completely killed, United States came into Judge Ritter's Court in Utah in -- in the -- in Salt Lake in --at -- in Utah, advised the Court that the defendants had left.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.021" offset="2000039">They had removed themselves to the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.199" offset="2008712">There were no longer any trespassers.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.764" offset="2014981">The case was moot and it could be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.789" offset="2023131">And on those grounds recited in his order of dismissal, the case was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.224" offset="2040895">They did not tell the Court that they had slaughtered the stock of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.866" offset="2067435">On this basis, Judge Ritter dismissed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.846" offset="2087288">Now, I want to tell you about the horse slaughter program and how it was done by Kinnaman and the other agents of Bureau of Land Management.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.523" offset="2122083">The facts make it perfectly clear and I state here categorically with a firmed belief that you will go along with me before the -- you finish consideration of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.448" offset="2157714">The facts make it perfectly clear that the object was to drive these people off the range.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.506" offset="2185927">All these men, (Inaudible), the stockmen, every person that knows that local environment, knows these Indians cannot live without these animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.206" offset="2240784">The Navajo horses are an integral part of the Navajo way of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.720" offset="2262831">It's a part of their religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.945" offset="2267742">It's a part of their death ceremonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.686" offset="2286655">They used the horses for every conceivable purpose, their means of carrying wood and water and provisions from distances which we city people would find quite remote for our shopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.069" offset="2328242">In times of great need and crisis, they've even used them as a reserve food supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.712" offset="2358753">They're used in tending the Navajo sheep, in carrying the sick and aged and in carrying the children and so too are the burros.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.102" offset="2392398">Both of which, the horses and the burros know Navajo demands and are trained, as I should point out from our particular purposes later or the Navajo purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.133" offset="2432522">For these and other reasons, the Bureau of Land Management agents knew that the program would remove the horses and the burros that ultimately get the Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.029" offset="2468049">Now, they proceeded under the Utah -- under the Utah law, the -- called the abandoned horse statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.950" offset="2499709">Actually, there are two statutes in Utah bearing upon this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.326" offset="2521234">The abandoned horse statute, the -- the first statute is the -- is the one that calls -- comes under the agricultural provisions of the -- of the Utah law and deals with the impoundment -- and deals with impoundment.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.733" offset="2598870">Without going into this at any great length at this moment, the language becomes important in our argument, but I -- I point out that there are two separate titles and two separate provisions of the Utah law, one, the abandoned horse statute, which is a nuisance statute permitting peremptory rounding up and slaughter with only public -- publication of notice and posting notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.584" offset="2718302">And the other is a statute which requires a reasonable search to ascertain the owners after which the animals were impounded and can be sold or otherwise disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.749" offset="2778906">This revoked the -- the abandoned horse statute is really a wild -- a wild horse statute to rid the range of animals which may be or are a menace, although the legislative history is barren as strictly the case in -- in some of these early proceedings or these proceedings in the western states.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.595" offset="3358302">They're seeking to drive the Indians off.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.627" offset="3370423">Now, by which steps did they do this as quickly as possible?</text>

            <text syncTime="854.389" offset="3417548">They proceeded under the nuisance laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.422" offset="3429669">And there was a very little procedure at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.159" offset="3448581">We quickly summarize at this.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.009" offset="3456000">That is a proceeding whereby the Board of County Commissioners inaugurates an impounding or a -- a roundup of these -- of these horses and burros and other animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.611" offset="3510439">It takes the resolution of course of the Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.699" offset="3518694">There are explicit instructions of the law about how it is to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.099" offset="3532382">Kinnaman went to the meeting of July the 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.699" offset="3542727">It was -- there's absolutely nothing in the minutes of July the 1st about any resolution to have a roundup.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.400" offset="3577522">The next thing we know -- and no resolution was adapted.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.846" offset="3595285">We -- the next thing we know is the publication notice of the roundup, July the 10th.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.316" offset="3621198">It isn't until September the 2nd, which is again, a regular meeting of the Board in every Tuesday or first Tuesday of every month that Kinnaman comes in and they adopt retroactively or nunc pro tunc, an attempt to adopt nunc pro tunc, a resolution authorizing this -- this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.370" offset="3701447">Now, actually, it develops that Kinnaman had gone around on July the 9th with a resolution and got each commissioner to personally sign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.882" offset="3731435">But under the well-established rules, and certainly, well established in the case of Utah, that, of course, is not a board meeting.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.249" offset="3780963">And it wasn't -- it doesn't appear in the minutes until -- actually, the meeting of September the 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.956" offset="3803742">They published the notices and the notices were in English, and of course, the Navajos can't read English.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.978" offset="3819833">As a matter of fact, they couldn't even be published in Navajo because Navajo is not a written language.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.142" offset="3836552">And as the -- as the District Court quite properly said, “It might have been -- it might as well have been posted out in the safe (Inaudible).”</text>
            <text syncTime="973.156" offset="3892558">Now, despite this makeshift procedure and the fact that they were proceeding under the nuisance statute, which contemplated the strong remedy of destruction for the animals gathered and not under the Impoundment Act, the federal agents went forward with the horse slaughter program, commencing about September the 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.513" offset="3966015">Now, I have told -- I wish to mention of course you surely can't -- both of the fact that the federal rangers are purporting to act in accordance with the state law, but this is a federal grazing district under the Taylor Grazing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.785" offset="4051069">It is governed by the federal law and the federal regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.490" offset="4061936">And there's the federal regulation right on this precise point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.288" offset="4077087">The regulation specified that in case of a violation, notice in the writing should be given to the violator in person or by registered mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.900" offset="4107598">We deal with this later but we want the Court to know now that no such notice as required by the federal regulations was any time served, nor was it mailed by a registered mail or in any other matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.085" offset="4168307">The -- the slaughter program, which I wish to bring your attention, was conducted in a most brutal fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.116" offset="4196415">The government agents knew that these horses belonged to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.650" offset="4214596">(Inaudible) to the Bureau of Land Management, had lived in this area, in this range for some 30 years and knew these Indians personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.994" offset="4243958">Perhaps, they didn't know that the particular horse belonged to a particular Indian that they certainly knew they were Indian horses and that was the object of this hunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.450" offset="4285753">Before going -- four-knowledge of these facts, they went on the range, rounded up with the horses, bullwhip to whip them into trucks and corrals, and in some instance, killing the horses on the range.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.160" offset="4356598">The horses, according to the testimony, were branded, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.041" offset="4372062">They were hauled to corrals where they were held for short periods of time for shipping to a glue factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.485" offset="4397871">Four or five of the horses were so terrified after being whipped into corrals and trucks that they've died while jammed into a truck in this terrifying condition, some were shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.489" offset="4441861">The truck arrived at Monticello with living and dead horses massed together and in a fight -- and in a frightful disorder, a horse's leg had -- had inconveniently jammed through the panel or rigging of the truck and couldn't be gotten out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.701" offset="4498704">It is not clear how long that poor, feared, frenzied animal endured the tortures of that rough ride over the -- over the Montezuma Creek terrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.096" offset="4564323">But in any event, when they got to Monticello, they couldn't get him out and I turn to the brief, grizzly description of the record at this point because counsel has made a -- point in his brief of an alleged error by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.943" offset="4643736">It said, “Well, when we got to Monticello, four of them were down, and these -- or these five were down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.706" offset="4674769">One of them had his foot through the rigging, and we couldn't possibly get him out and he was just about dead anyhow, so we had to shoot him and shoot his foot off to get him out of the trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.574" offset="4718237">There were two already dead that had been trampled into hauling them in and another one so near dead, they killed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.956" offset="4743732">And later, another got sick and was unable to eat or drink and we hauled it out and shot it about two days later.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.467" offset="4765780">That's at page 301 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.652" offset="4790544">The Government has taken occasion to point out this particular excerpt because we said -- we said in the findings and we said in our brief perpetuating the statement that the leg of the horse was sawed off or plainly, the record shows that the record -- that the leg of the horse was shot off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.281" offset="4861074">Now, I'm not a particularly -- particularly expert at this type of amputation but reason told me that they couldn't very well shoot this horse's leg off with a the right foot be pretty hard to do and the men went on with shotguns or machine guns, so I've gotten in touch with the reporter to verify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.481" offset="4937874">And the reporter did make an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.527" offset="4946024">The horse's leg for counsel's information was sawed off and not shot off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.246" offset="4968908">And I submit the affidavit of the court reporter for the record to clarify that unfortunate mistake in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.255" offset="5013002">If counsel can get any -- any relief, whatever out of that error in the record, he's welcome to it, but I do point out that it's the only place he's been able to point out a real error in the findings of the District Court and it turns out not to be an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.874" offset="5075487">The Court's memory was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.204" offset="5080816">The leg was sawed off and wasn't shot off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.850" offset="5099311">And no other errors of any significance have been -- have been brought to our attention at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.682" offset="5130658">There are other instances of brutality in connection with this roundup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.152" offset="5144555">The record reveals that the grim situation where we find federal agents participating in the handcuffing of four Indian women, the skin of their wrist were broken and they were bleeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.560" offset="5190217">They took their sheep.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.661" offset="5194606">They took the sheep away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.660" offset="5202547">We do not know what terrifying conversation took place among these women but the federal agents and the white stockmen who had them in hand had one purpose and that was to frighten them off the range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.741" offset="5246955">And before these people could get their sheep back, they had to pay the white stockman, Leland Redd in that particular instance, $488, a completely unadjudicated sum of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.598" offset="5294289">Leland Redd said, “$480,” and the sheriff said, “pay it” and they dug down in what savings they had and paid it to get the stocks back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.962" offset="5323755">In other instance, (Inaudible) approached the mother of two children, that's Jim Joe's daughter and advised her that she must leave the country and get back to the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.376" offset="5361476">She was one of the old residents there too, and she was -- and if she was still there in seven days, he'd arrest her and -- and she'd had to leave the country or she'd be put in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.087" offset="5412258">She left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.885" offset="5423438">On the redemption of the horses, the statute of course allows the redemption of horses even with a roundup of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.342" offset="5469309">The horses were to be kept in corral not too far distant from the general area where the owners resided in order that the redemption might be feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.221" offset="5504836">In this case, they were all in a considerable distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.654" offset="5522599">And a number of these petitioners trail the horses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.199" offset="5540780">It's a singularly undignified fact that the great United States Government to use the western expression actually moonlighted those horses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.196" offset="5580696">It had (Inaudible) waiting out on a mesa behind Sakezzie's hogan until the horses were turned out and the Indians have gone to bed and when they drifted far enough away from their corral, the -- the Bureau of Land Management agents got them, and got them into their trucks and hauled them away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.228" offset="5652898">And the Indians, the modern Indians, being able to follow the tire track and a boot track followed the well-known (Inaudible) tracks and they went to the corral where these horses were -- were corralled in hopes of getting them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.834" offset="5723324">Lee Redd, who, with Delbert Redd was a stockman who shared the Sakezzie great range when they cancelled his permit in 1947, Delbert Redd and Leland Redd split it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.841" offset="5779331">And Leland Redd got the reservoir, which is a priceless thing, which the Navajos have built.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.798" offset="5811096">Leland Redd went off and brought some men back with guns and the men were seen loading and unloading their guns to let the Indians know that they had guns in their hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.563" offset="5854250">If they wanted trouble, they'd have trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.811" offset="5867207">One of the women frightened that their men would be killed and said, “We better get out of here,” and they left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.462" offset="5893747">We mentioned this in contrast to the delicate way in which the federal agents dealt with the horses of the white man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.882" offset="5919451">They got theirs back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.177" offset="5924676">There were three to four -- five -- five of them, I believe, rounded up and they got them back without difficulty for $2.50 a head, delivered back to their pasture and back to their corral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.583" offset="5966263">But when the Indians asked for theirs, $60 a head, which of course was impossible because he didn't have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.884" offset="5999491">As a result of this action, on the part of the federal agents, some 116 horses and 38 burros were slaughtered or destroyed or taken to the glue factory in Colbo where they were sold for two or three cents a pound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.462" offset="6053825">The $1700 received for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.202" offset="6068767">It was given to the Advisory Committee under the -- under the Taylor Grazing Act, the local Advisory Committee of stockmen who were the ones particularly inert into driving these Indians out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.833" offset="6107324">It didn't go to the Government nor did it come back to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.733" offset="6126864">Even the reservoir built by Sakezzie has been taken over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.724" offset="6142851">Now, enough for the horse program, but what happened to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.142" offset="6168555">We have to mention this because of the attack which has been launched on the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.141" offset="6196558">Suit was brought seeking damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.428" offset="6209620">This was the first -- the Ritter -- Judge Ritter had heard the matter since this other case had been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.647" offset="6234488">Suit was brought for damages by these people for local attorneys.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.576" offset="6290286">The authority was admitted at the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.027" offset="6532075">In -- in the connection with this rather shocking assault by the Government, it's necessary to point out that this trial proceeded in a very orderly way up to the time when -- when Judge Ritter found the first witness, Kinnaman, a very evasive and elusive witness and discovered that right at the time of the trial and even while the other case was still pending in the Court, the one that he dismissed, June 27th 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.346" offset="6645342">Even while that case was still pending, asking for an injunction, Kinnaman have gone out and done the acts which I've told you about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.915" offset="6671569">These actions were done in 1952, commencing with the -- with the slaughter program, the roundup program of September the 20th, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.078" offset="6708245">So, everything I've told you was done while that original injunction case was still pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.940" offset="6731755">And then, the Government went back to Ritter and said, “The people have left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.700" offset="6750772">There are no more trespassers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.047" offset="6756101">They've gone away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.773" offset="6759027">We can dismiss that the question is moot,” and he dismissed that case on the grounds that was moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.369" offset="6777417">So, when we come back into this Court with the -- with the Tort Claims Act for damages for the destruction of that property of the Indians, I think any judge would be reasonably concerned about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.031" offset="6824124">And when Kinnaman admitted and he has repeatedly admitted, I won't get to the record and take the time, but in our reply brief, we set forth immediately at the further reply brief the admissions of Kinnaman that -- that he does destroying the stock right -- while he was talking to the judge, the program was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.821" offset="6907193">Now, these were reluctant witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.932" offset="6939690">Of course, the judge was indignant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.098" offset="6952333">Of course, he became curious with this type of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.214" offset="6972813">In a matter of fact, I was never aware until I read counsel's brief that -- that there was any tradition that a man -- that an appointment to the federal bench meant that a man was sterilized in his capacity for moral indignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.057" offset="7028193">It seems to be implied that -- that he shouldn't have had these feelings but they were outrageous facts which he confronted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.175" offset="7080647">Their answer is not an attack upon the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.357" offset="7093394">They have not successfully launched an attack upon the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.884" offset="7103530">They've attacked the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.098" offset="7112307">Is that a way to rehabilitate a new technique for rehabilitating evasive and -- and unsatisfactory witnesses whom the judge does not believe and who are in absolute contempt to Court in the conduct they were following?</text>

            <text syncTime="1805.670" offset="7222648">Without these horses, the Navajos can't live.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.477" offset="7233829">There was a difference of opinion as to value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.980" offset="7243860">The white men said they were worth two or three cents a pound, the glue factory of what they got, what they got for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.272" offset="7269042">They weren't white men's horses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.711" offset="7278759">They were Indian horses, of great, unique value to the Indian civilization, used for every conceivable purpose, in the transportation of wood from distances that you -- that are unbelievable to us, to keep those hogans through those bitterly cold Utah winters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.533" offset="7366113">All those things that the horses and the burros did for the Indians that go into the question of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.274" offset="7385025">We must keep in mind that the testimony shows that they -- they weren't ordinary in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.884" offset="7407491">They were bred for the country and trained for the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.632" offset="7418462">The Navajos trained them carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.337" offset="7425254">They could go for two or three days without water, the ordinary horse can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.670" offset="7438629">The ordinary horse gets lame on the hard plains of -- of the -- of the prairie that we are talking about, the country that we're in now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.028" offset="7476036">You can't use them and these horses are specially trained for those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.497" offset="7493904">They obey the Navajos' command and they can be turned loose on the range and always come home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.114" offset="7516369">These attributes, the Navajos' horses are absolutely unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.512" offset="7529953">The -- the burros too had some of these distinguishing qualities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.819" offset="7547193">And so, the Court entered a judgment of $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.236" offset="7560882">There is agreement in the record as to number of horses and burros owned by each of the petitioners, not stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.742" offset="7594945">And the Government objects to the $100,000 as excessive according to the white man's evaluation of the horses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.959" offset="7619814">We have established and I submit it on the briefs without a discussion, overwhelming authority to defect as to the allowance of damages for actual and consequential damages are sustained by the Utah decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.379" offset="7697450">And if there is any evidence to support judgment, the judgment of the trial court is sustained and not reversed, whether there's any evidence whatever they stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.520" offset="7742067">But on this $100,000, we are certainly dealing with trivia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.897" offset="7767562">May I – may I suggest that it's almost impossible to embrace the impacts of this incident on this Indian order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.077" offset="11856248">Then, we'd come to the Government's issue which is perhaps the main issue of this case undoubtedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.218" offset="11872862">Does the Federal Tort Claims Act cover authorize trespass or much of these Indians or must these Indians go uncompensated for these depredations?</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.976" offset="12043807">The Government falls back to raise query of the tort issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.759" offset="12067004">The Government falls back upon the doctrine that the trespassers committed by the government agents within the scope of their authority are not compensable under the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.969" offset="12115801">The operative words in the Act are negligence and negligent and wrongful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.015" offset="12131997">This Court had worked those -- worked over those words so often that I can add little light to -- if at -- if at all, to your understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.536" offset="12174106">But I ask, what would “wrongful” possibly mean if it didn't mean trespasses and we have quoted section of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.685" offset="12210678">It shows that it clearly contemplates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.962" offset="12219768">Certainly, the Tort Claims Act cannot be interposed to provide a simple, non-jury negligence practice that the Government's construction would simply strike from the word -- strike out from the Act the word “wrongful,” to allow its full scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.908" offset="12283611">And I submit in the illustration these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.741" offset="12322900">If a driver of a government mail truck sets out from the post office and negligently hits somebody on the street, liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.135" offset="12368457">He's in the course of his official duties acting with authority, liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.964" offset="12435853">Don't drive negligently but drive right into Mr. Smith's truck down there and smash it up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.627" offset="12466469">Under the Government's view, the Government would be liable in the first case, no liability in the next -- in the next case, the Dalehite case.</text>
