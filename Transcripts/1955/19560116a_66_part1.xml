          <heading>Argument of Maurice Rosenfield</heading>
          <turn speaker="maurice_rosenfield" startTime="0.000" stopTime="455.749">
            <label>Mr. Maurice Rosenfield</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">This case, which is here on certiorari to the Seventh Circuit, involves a Wisconsin corporation's defense to a diversity suit of Chicago on the ground that it was not doing business there.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.160" offset="68545">The exact issue, which this creates on this Court, is whether this defense is to be tested on the merits by state law under the Erie rule or whether it is governed by the principles announced by this Court in the International Shoe case, or whether it's is governed by 1404 (a) of the Judicial Code enacted in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.480" offset="181917">The action wanted to enjoin a common law tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.787" offset="195082">The infringement of the name Riverbank is applied to acoustical doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.483" offset="217861">The key facts bearing on the question of doing business are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.783" offset="239073">The defendant is a Wisconsin corporation with its home office at Neenah, Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.857" offset="259344">It has maintained a Chicago office for 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.247" offset="276898">Its acoustical division, which is called as acoustical department, is headquartered at Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.819" offset="307200">The acoustical -- the acoustical department of Chicago solicited business in Illinois and throughout the country, and supervised other agents located elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.025" offset="355997">Sales manuals and literature went from the department headquarters of Chicago all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.718" offset="386821">The Chicago headquarters of the acoustical department was responsible for sales everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.161" offset="412630">The agent in charge of the Chicago office knew more about acoustics than the chief executives of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.472" offset="441887">His compensation reflected his special contributions to the development of the company's product.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.711" offset="474802">Shipments by the defendant into Illinois amounted to over $500,000 a year and into the Chicago area about $100,000, but it is true that the sales blanks here are used by the defendant, had a clause printed on the back requiring all orders to be accepted at the home office.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.810" offset="575216">On consideration of these facts, the District Court overruled the motion to dismiss, proceeded to the merits and granted an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.493" offset="613878">It was appealed to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.597" offset="626312">The case was brief and argued on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.178" offset="640627">The defendant, however, preserved this jurisdictional point and persuaded the Court to that effect, holding the lower court lack jurisdiction it reversed for dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.972" offset="687856">Its decision was based entirely on an Illinois rule that when orders are solicited subject to acceptance at a home office, the corporation is not doing business and is not suable.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.347" offset="757342">A couple of preliminary points to put this issue in contest, first, this case, raises no question of venue under the federal venue statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.677" offset="802691">Our opponents characterized the case as raising a question of venue under Section 1391 (c) of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.470" offset="841874">If the Court accepts that characterization of the case, it must reverse it because venue may be satisfied in one of two ways, then you can be laid, either where all the plaintiffs reside or where the defendant resides.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.472" offset="901851">There is one plaintiff here and that plaintiff resided in the district -- in the division where the case was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.473" offset="933825">Since, therefore, a venue was satisfied under 1391 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="237.950" offset="951798">There is no occasion at all to look to 1391 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="244.368" offset="977398">The second preliminary issue is this, the defendant pleads for trial at Neenah, Wisconsin under the laws of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.404" offset="1017522">This is a misleading statement of the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.637" offset="1030478">The alternative was not and never was trialed in the state court of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.806" offset="1055138">The alternative to trial in the District Court of Chicago was trialed in the federal court at Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.788" offset="1083141">Neenah happens to be in the Milwaukee federal district, the southern district of Wisconsin, 90 miles from Chicago, and it would have been one of these two federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.006" offset="1147925">More than that, both of them obviously are within the Seventh Circuit, so that this case, if the decision holds, must go back to another federal court within the same circuit only to -- only to return to that Circuit for decision on the merits, and it must go to that Court on the merits since it's important enough to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.777" offset="1227024">It will be important enough to either side to take it to the Court of Appeals for decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.976" offset="1247817">This has deeper implications though, just then that the parties have been subjected to expense in delay in the federal judicial system to inconvenience and burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.715" offset="1294838">A deeper significance is that it points out exactly what the issue is on the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.091" offset="1316362">Not doing business defense is raised in diversity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.866" offset="1331409">The issue is in what the federal district does at fair administration of justice permit this case to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.533" offset="1366100">That's all that's involved when it is in -- when the issue was raised in a -- in a diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.275" offset="1389087">Now, when the issue arises in the state court, it's really a bad issue too, no matter how perverse a plaintiff's judgment may have been in selecting his forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.680" offset="1430674">No court has ever been known to dismiss him on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.995" offset="1443944">The object of the decision obviously is to get the case tried on the merits in some other place, a more preferred forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.379" offset="1493473">Now, this Court has exercised control over state excess in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.505" offset="1509982">That is when the States go too far in taking these cases against corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.055" offset="1528163">It has always exercised control over the States under the Due Process Clause for 63 years from St. Clair against Cox in 1882, 160 U.S. to the International Shoe case in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.856" offset="1591380">This control was in jurisprudential terms involving the nature of corporate personality presence, whether a corporation was present or could be present outside of the State which created it.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.213" offset="1652820">In 1945, this Court reconsidered the entire matter, reevaluated the principles and changed the due process test to one of fairness, decency, substantial justice, stating that what is required is a balancing of convenience, an estimate of inconvenience and this meant an evaluation to both sides, not just the corporate defendant, but in the evaluation of the plaintiff's position as well as the defendant's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.064" offset="1780193">In the new terms of the International Shoe case, the control device was indistinguishable from a doctrine of forum non-convenience.</text>

            <text syncTime="3001.802" offset="12007131">I say it is Section 1391 (c) and that Section states, “A corporation may be sued in any judicial district in which it is incorporated or licensed to do business or is doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.943" offset="12087693">And such judicial district shall be regarded as the residence of such corporation for venue purposes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.494" offset="12121966">Now, the federal jurisdiction in diversity situations as well in -- as in federal question cases, being founded as it is on the Constitution is such that if Congress had so intended, it had the power to grant nationwide jurisdiction of all classes of litigants to each and every District Court, Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.583" offset="12282253">Now, Congress saw fit to specify the geographical locations of term of residents or litigants where these cases should be brought, and it would be to deny the scope and effect of this broad federal jurisdictional power, rather than to strengthen it to say that Congress didn't have the right to make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.685" offset="12410671">And in this instance, we have a section of the statute which is directly applicable that says, “A corporation can be sued where it's incorporated,” and that is directly a question of state law as to be ascertained in that fashion only where it is licensed to do business, which is also a question of state law to be ascertained and like other or where it is doing the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.674" offset="12510668">And at the time of the enactment of that section of the statute which is a part of the Judicial Code, which came into being in 1948, and I believe Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Douglas were on the Committee, conferred the connection with that thing, and no doubt perhaps even gave attention to this particular part of the enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.380" offset="12629473">The phrase, “doing business” had a very definite specific technical meaning, which had been acquired in the light of these state rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="3320.698" offset="13282743">Everything was phrased in terms of natural persons and everything was made dependent upon the decision of law which had been developed and first granted a corporation, the equivalent of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.479" offset="13345855">Finally, it had been elaborated into the question of residents and finding to the question of whether it could migrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.623" offset="13386397">Now, if we are to search for a meaning for the phrase, I'd say we have to take it against that background.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.345" offset="13441358">And the background had fully evolved then, had developed a meaning for the term which is specific in each state and quite definite there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.803" offset="13483154">Now, as I say, need we investigate under what misapprehension the State may have adapted the rule if the rule is satisfactory to the State?</text>
