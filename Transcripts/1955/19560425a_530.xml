            <label>Ms. Beatrice Lampert</label>
            <text syncTime="14.593" offset="58305">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.201" offset="72725">The judgment which is challenged in this case proscribes mass picketing, violence, traffic obstructions and related activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.065" offset="112222">As I understood counsel in his argument yesterday, the authority of the State to regulate those activities, I believe, I quote correctly when I say "to regulate and punish those activities is not questioned."</text>
            <text syncTime="45.179" offset="180663">As I understood the questioning, I believe counsel said that they did not question the State's authority either to enter injunctions proscribing such conduct in equity proceedings on the application of private parties but they do question the State's authority to do the regulation in the manner in which it was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.264" offset="280973">I think therefore it may be more helpful if I start out on a practical approach to the problem Wisconsin and the attempts Wisconsin has made to solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.632" offset="350459">I -- I think that there's no question that if a State has authority to preserve the peace and to regulate the type of conduct that is here involved, it has a correlative duty unless one has been a law enforcement officer on the scene of a mass labor dispute with all the bitterness, the hostility, the potential explosiveness to others, he can't possibly realize the problem that it is involved, but he -- they can realize that it is no privilege to do such regulation, it's a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.669" offset="550661">We are not here because we're power hungry.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.961" offset="575843">We're here because we've been faced with the demand of our citizens to control this difficult situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.728" offset="622864">It's not something that we would like to do if anybody else is willing to.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.411" offset="641567">Anybody -- any agency which is able and willing to control the situation is more than welcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.075" offset="676258">But up to date, there has been no agency but ourselves and we have met with the unpleasant resentment of -- from one side if we do and from resentment from the other side if we don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.567" offset="746266">But the problem is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.535" offset="754103">So we have tried to meet it and this is how we have done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.048" offset="772180">We feel that in these localities, where feelings are run -- running extremely high as they always do in small communities where there is a labor dispute, that we must have a method that is far enough removed from the disputants themselves to be impartial.At the same time, we must have a close enough and flexible enough to move rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.323" offset="893283">Wisconsin, I think both legislatively and administratively, has made an honest effort to meet that situation without encroaching upon the area which we believe this Court says Congress has intended should be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.737" offset="966844">The legislative plan has been devised in an attempt to find something more expeditious and flexible than mere punishment and putting in jail of individuals and also to meet that situation of impartiality in the particular dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.258" offset="1060989">It combines some of the elements of -- of criminal statutes, some of the elements of equity injunction procedure but with the more objectionable element of both omitted and with a more expeditious and effective procedure, we believe, substituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.685" offset="1158687">Instead of the general proscription of say mass picketing by a criminal law applicable throughout the entire State, Wisconsin has said that we will appoint a body to conduct a full hearing and -- and then devise and define those proscriptions according to the particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.822" offset="1279269">So that everybody may know exactly what is put here but in -- in a particular case instead of having to take the chance of deciding for himself whether two or five or ten people in an area does involve and constitute mass picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.172" offset="1356591">Now, this -- this is akin to the formulation of a statutory definition of -- which might be found in a criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.182" offset="1416673">It does not involve in the first instance any penalty at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.658" offset="1430570">This is -- it follows a full hearing and which both sides are entitled to present anything they feel is pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.086" offset="1472261">They -- the full hearing was held by the State Labor Board in this case and it found there have been assaults, injury to property, mass picketing, of arrests, obstruction of entrance or egress, violence of various types.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.178" offset="1568705">Now, it is -- it was suggested in the reply brief of the appellant, I believe, that it is not conceded that these things occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.642" offset="1602560">However, the appellant did not elect to print any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.966" offset="1631817">We are before the Court on basis of the findings and since what is prohibited by the judgment is the same type of conduct which was found to have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.871" offset="1675389">Presumably, there would be no reason for being here if they had not occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.174" offset="1692630">In any event, the kind of conduct described in the findings of the Board is all that is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.924" offset="1715618">So that if it did not occur and if it is not anticipated by the appellants that they want to engage in it in the future, certainly, nobody has been prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.291" offset="1769117">Now, the second step in the legislative plan is a full court review.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.330" offset="1789283">The Board's order carries no penalty neither does it mean anything until it has been enforced by a court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.904" offset="1819585">The enforcement is strictly, of course, on review.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.610" offset="1830348">There's no more evidence but the enforcement procedure guarantees the right of all parties to have the legal issues heard and have the Court to determine whether the Board acted properly within its authority and legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.464" offset="1897848">The Court in this case, it has been suggested, was not satisfied with the order but felt itself bound by rules of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.976" offset="1983843">I think, perhaps, counsel drew inferences from the statement quoted in the brief that are not warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.108" offset="2020415">I think there's no question that the Court sitting in review felt that it would like to get out, get its hands on the said dispute and settle it if it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.903" offset="2071510">It would like, of course, as any appellate court would to -- to solve the whole problem right then and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.469" offset="2109858">So, the Court was talking about the fact that it had certain restrictions because it was sitting in review only but there was no question in the Courts' mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.768" offset="2154998">And I -- I think I will read a bit of the -- just a bit of the Court's decision that the subject matter proscribed was perfectly, properly prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.659" offset="2198570">The Court said it would seem most unreasonable and illogical if any court should hold that a state court of record would be impotent to restrain the Commission of acts that are in themselves illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.175" offset="2244650">There is no inherent right on the part of individual members of the union or the union as an organization or its officers in directing it to engage in mass picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.952" offset="2283729">There is no inherent right on the part of any of your -- members of unions to intimidate, to threaten, to assault or to unlawfully interfere with the liberties of any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.445" offset="2321763">So, it would seem to me that the complaint is groundless when it is exerted on the proposition that those types of actions should not be restrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.284" offset="2357081">Now, that's all we're doing in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.900" offset="2367530">None of the courts had any question in their mind if what the Board had done was proper, of course, the Court as well as the Board would have like to go farther and settle the labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.559" offset="2418207">But the very fact that we restrained ourselves to the portion of the area which is properly within our jurisdiction should not be a point of criticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.494" offset="2461884">It should be rather, I think, a recognition that we have tried to -- to assume our proper share in the governmental scheme and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.392" offset="2521548">Now, it was suggested, I think at this point it might be well to -- to take up the discussion that was held yesterday on the fact that -- that counsel apparently concedes that it would be proper for a state court to issue an injunction against this identical conduct if it had been applied for by a private party and issued under general rules of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.166" offset="2632620">I would like to call the Court's attention to the fact that Wisconsin Supreme Court has said that the State Board has discretion to grant or withhold a remedy on equitable principles fully as much as could be done under the older common law injunction cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.731" offset="2718824">I did not cite the case in my brief, and I will cite it for the benefit of the Court, Appleton Chair Corporation versus United Brotherhood, 239, Wis.337, 1 N.W.2d 188 in which there was wrongful conduct shown before the Board on the part of both an employer and a labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.307" offset="2809208">The Board, the State Board, issued a remedy solely against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.767" offset="2826971">The employer complained that that was not proper, that it had been shown that the labor organization too was guilty of unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.846" offset="2871380">Nonetheless, the Supreme Court said that the statute contemplated that the Board should weigh the conduct of the adverse parties and should give what remedy at peace it deemed just to the private rights and necessary for the public protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.528" offset="2962077">And it is not true in any event in most states, at least, including Wisconsin that an injunction can be obtained in connection with a labor dispute irrespective of statutes defining the labor policy of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.588" offset="3034279">Wisconsin has, as most states, has its -- the Norris-LaGuardia Act which prescribes principles under the labor policy of the State which we strict the issuance of injunctions in connection with labor disputes irrespective of who the moving party is.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.319" offset="3101257">All right, now, that is the second step to --</text>

            <text syncTime="810.707" offset="3242736">There has been a tendency to issue ex parte injunctions because the courts didn't have time to -- to try the cases solely to -- those were reasons why Wisconsin felt we will establish a labor board that is always supposed to be ready at a moments notice to take care of an emergency.</text>

            <text syncTime="838.442" offset="3353704">I think the testimony in this case was exceedingly long, it ran through many, many pages which is probably why it -- it wasn't printed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.460" offset="3385783">The hearings themselves took days and days but the order of the Board was out in a little over a month from the time the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.930" offset="3447641">If I may say, I think hereto, it was suggested in argument that the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin commented that by the time the case got to it, the questions relating to employer conduct were not pertinent and the reason it said so, why is because the appellants did not chose to bring them in issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.938" offset="3551713">As I have demonstrated by -- the case I have quite quoted to the Court, the Appleton Chair case, any conduct amounting to an unfair practice could have been alleged as a counter complaint and could have been considered by the Board if appellant said he'd like you to do so but if they -- they preferred to take it to some other agency, obviously there's nothing that the State can do to any excess of its jurisdiction and it should not be criticized for not deciding something that was not brought before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="977.226" offset="3908859">The two general reasons why the people ordinarily go to our administrative agency is that it is faster and that it is a little farther away from the scenes.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.377" offset="3965492">You would have to apply for your -- to -- for your injunction in a local court.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.252" offset="3980957">Very frequently, their court -- the judges have some interest that impels them to disqualify themselves and it is sometimes slow, particularly if we have to get in an outside judge.But that procedure is still available if one elects to pursue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.282" offset="4053055">Now, then up to that stage, we've had two proceedings and we've had a proceeding before the Board and proceeding before the Court to tell people what is proper conduct not impinging upon the public interest in this case and there has been no penalty or no possibility of penalty and that isn't such a case as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.127" offset="4136438">The third step before we can have any penalty or at least in practice before we have had any penalty involves a civil contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.888" offset="4179487">That is a full court, full desk court proceeding, with the Board restricted by exactly the same rules that apply to any other -- a hold or other judgment in a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.533" offset="4250122">It must file its pleadings which must be verified affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.250" offset="4280947">It must give notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.662" offset="4286589">There must be a full trial before a court record, only then, if the Court finds that after these previous two steps have been taken, can anybody be penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.393" offset="4345522">At least in practice, that is the way in which all these cases which we have cited in our briefs have come to the courts and up to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.284" offset="4389094">Under our civil contempt statutes, aside from the payment of damages to injured parties, the limit, the absolute outside limit of any penalty which could be imposed for violation of this judgment is $250 in fine or six months in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.345" offset="4473313">And I assure you, we do not exercise even that small sanction indiscriminately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.751" offset="4502988">For many, many years, I am the only counsel the State Board has had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.897" offset="4519497">It develops upon me to conduct these contempt proceedings and they are arduous, we don't do them except as a last resort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.226" offset="4556904">So there have been very few people actually penalized under this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.668" offset="4582609">The idea is to let them know what they can and cannot do and a great majority of people want to do what they should when they know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.992" offset="4615941">So that is the procedure upon we -- which we have come up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.515" offset="4637989">Now, the factual background, I think it's a little bit important in determining why we can't just simply rely on arrests and imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.418" offset="4693577">This dispute occurred in a village of less than 2000 population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.819" offset="4711236">Many of the employees of the company involved come from other communities so that the number of striking employees exceeded the total population of the village.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.290" offset="4757107">They were aided by affiliates and of persons assigned to assist from other places and by sympathizers in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.578" offset="4806217">So that the number of persons engaged in mass picketing exceeded the total number of residents in the village -- I mean exceeded in engaging in picketing activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.915" offset="4851566">I think it can be taken as common knowledge that in a village of that size, there is not more than a handful of policemen who are not trained for mob control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.158" offset="4900571">Their average duty will probably be at the most making an arrest of a single citizen at a time for -- I don't -- bringing -- (Inaudible) at a neighbor's guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.421" offset="4941636">They -- I expected them under the criminal procedure to go out among these 2000 people and put in enough people and arrest them and go start the wheels of the criminal procedure running to keep the matter under control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.789" offset="5003076">Well, not only, even if they could do that, there are still further difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.171" offset="5028676">A small community involves almost always, at least a dozen in Wisconsin certainly elected enforcement officials including prosecuting attorneys and judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.339" offset="5081339">In that community, where a large dispute of this nature is going on, everybody has an opinion, everybody is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.281" offset="5117074">Drawing a jury which has no opinion on an unsolved case, for instance, would take weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.286" offset="5145078">A prosecuting attorney who is too zealous may be unable to finish his cases because an election intervenes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.918" offset="5171618">A judge and that is a matter of record in this case that the judge, even the one who had to hear the Board's petition for enforcement which was solely reviewed, disqualified himself because he had been criticized before sitting on an assault case, when he had stock in a grocery store or interested in a grocery store where some of the strikers were trading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.705" offset="5254792">Those things make it a practical problem in most communities to try to control by this criminal procedure which goes on for months and months and months when the courts are crowded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.311" offset="5313202">If we had 2000 people participating and tried them each individually and do a criminal process, the strike would long, long, long be over before anybody would be brought to test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.062" offset="5372238">The -- and I have -- I have, I think, explained why the -- the State has offered this additional method into the common law method of injunction on basis of the private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.290" offset="5453113">I think, possibly, this is one of the cases in which the administrative procedure before the Board was simply for the private party than finding a judge who would be willing to sit in a private injunction suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.272" offset="5509016">Now, secondly, that -- that is the legislative process which has tried to find a practical solution to what it deems to be of duty not of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.685" offset="5554678">Secondly, the Board has made an honest effort in this case to abstain from the area which it understands that from the decisions of this Court have been preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.162" offset="5624581">As -- we will show and I'm bringing -- about to show, I think, now that there is actually no duplication of any function which can be exercised by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.340" offset="5673273">But I -- I -- in doing so, I don't want to be understood as indicating that the action would be improper if there were duplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.311" offset="5701172">The legislative records we have quoted have said expressly that in these extreme cases and surely, violence is an extreme case, then there's no objection that there is duplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.579" offset="5754253">Counsel did suggest in his -- in its reply brief that there is, and I quote, “A dearth of references to state labor laws except in connection with 10 (a) and 14 (b)."</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.706" offset="5806811">Well, now, we could have quoted many more than we did but we quoted at least four in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.575" offset="5834292">One appears on page 8 which -- in which Representative Kristen of Wisconsin questioned Mr. Hartley and said, “Now, does this law -- and this was not in connection with 10 (a) or 14 (b), said, "Does this law leave as much as it's possible to States?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.249" offset="5912973">Leave it to them to settle disputes at the state level and -- and Kristen -- and he spoke expressly of the Wisconsin law, the very law that is here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.512" offset="5949962">And Mr. Taft and Mr. Hartley said, “Yes, that's the intention of this law, the law as a whole.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.850" offset="5979324">On page 8 -- or on page 10, Mr. -- I think it was Senator Ball who made reference to the Allis-Chalmers strike as being one of the types of things that -- where there was state control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.325" offset="6041287">The activities in the Allis-Chalmers strike have -- it was a year or two before that were very, very similar to this case excepting on a greater scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.279" offset="6085068">And Senator Ball told the Congress at that time that those things that were -- were controlled by state law and by state law he could have meant only the law that was involved in the Allis-Chalmers case which came to this Court on petition for certiorari and which certiorari was denied, the identical law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.112" offset="6160405">And he referred -- it is suggested that when he referred to peace officers, he wasn't referring to labor boards but to a larger extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.796" offset="6203141">I, counsel for the Labor Board, consider myself a peace officer of the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.728" offset="6218815">The traffic policeman, all those who have other duties are also peace officer, every law enforcement officer is in essence fundamentally a peace officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.638" offset="6258521">That is the very basic part of our governmental protection which the citizens expect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.642" offset="6286524">We start with that on the assumption and then go on to the more specialized duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.020" offset="6304078">Then at page 11 of our brief, we've -- we have quoted, Senator Wiley's reference to Wisconsin and other states labor boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.322" offset="6333231">And at page 17, we've -- we've quoted in a footnote Senator Taft's actual quotation to Congress of the very section of the Wisconsin law which is primarily here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.842" offset="6387357">So certainly, when they were talking about and there are many others which we didn't have time or space to quote of course, but when they were talking about continuing state jurisdiction and at the same time talking about these very laws, surely, had they meant to exempt regulation by this type of law, they would have made it clearer in their arguments or in the wording of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.866" offset="6499370">Now, I wish, however, to go ahead now and try to demonstrate the point that I referred to earlier that the Board tried to apply only those portions of the Wisconsin law which do not involve infringement on an area which this Court has held has been preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.923" offset="6587664">This Court recognized in the Allen-Bradley case which has been many times cited that the part of the state law which will be considered for purposes of validity is only that part which is applied in the specific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.345" offset="6645342">That we -- we concede that there are other parts of the Wisconsin law including one almost comparable to Section 8 (b) (1) which is the basis of the claim of conflict in this case but they have not been applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.556" offset="6722142">So our question as to validity of the state action depends only on the action itself, the findings and the specific provisions of law under which they are authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.004" offset="6787971">Now, counsel objected yesterday to our reference to the fact that Wisconsin law is not concerned solely with employer-employee relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.866" offset="6843455">It makes it an unfair practice for any person to engage in the kind of conduct defining that the law is unfair and counsel said that we did not apply that provision in this case but we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.346" offset="6893296">The greatest, thus far, the greatest number of persons who are restrained by this judgment are members of the union, 2000 or so at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.877" offset="6939481">We couldn't possibly have included them in this proscription had it not been for this provision because we did not attempt to decide on anybody's employee status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.583" offset="7002279">We have -- it was suggested that the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act regulates only labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.015" offset="7027984">It does, of course, regulate labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.371" offset="7037388">But in addition, the legislature has said it also regulates the relations between third parties and the public and those participants in the labor dispute who may go out and infringe on third party's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.024" offset="7104052">I find that in our Section 111.02 -- no, 111.01 subparagraph (2) of the Wisconsin statute which is quoted at pages 56 to 57 of our brief has been there wrongly cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.488" offset="7177927">The -- the proper citation is 111.01 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.419" offset="7201646">The legislature said there, "It is also recognized that whatever may be the rights of disputants with respect to each other in any controversy regarding employment relations whatever those may be and disregarding them, they should not be permitted in the conduct of their controversy regarding employment relations to intrude directly into the primary rights of third parties to earn a livelihood, transact business and engage in the ordinary affairs of life by any lawful means and free from molestation, interference, restrain or coercion."</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.073" offset="8664189">They tried to preserve the situation so that when the National Board decides the questions before it, which have been pending for years, there will be something on which the National Board's decision can operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.821" offset="8715180">But in -- in trying to preserve that, the Board very carefully tried to refrain and -- and not -- and honestly, it tried to avoid any -- any area which they didn't have the right to go into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.049" offset="8780173">This -- the State Board has many times dismissed cases on grounds of lack of jurisdiction and the state court has done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.251" offset="8808908">Of course, the state court had -- felt it had jurisdiction until this Court decided differently in several cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.490" offset="8833881">It has -- for instance, in cases similar to the Garner situation, it has believed that the State had jurisdiction until the Garner decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.610" offset="8870348">But after the Garner decision, it immediately dismissed any matters involving many peaceful picketing on the grounds of illegal objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.929" offset="8911621">Here, however, there are two provisions of the State Board's order that are absolutely unconnected with any employer-employee relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.972" offset="8959791">Everybody involved in this case is proscribed from obstructing or interfering in anyway with ingress to or egress from the Kohler (obstructing or interfering with the free and uninterrupted use of public roads, streets, highways, railways or private drives leading to the premises of the Kohler Company).</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.177" offset="9036696">The -- that -- there is added to that a limitation of the number of pickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.068" offset="9056235">The Board has said that when you go over 200 pickets in that area, in that village, you're mass picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.392" offset="9081522">You can -- you can go up to 200 pickets without violating this order, 25 at any one gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.396" offset="9117571">That certainly is enough to advertise a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.882" offset="9135438">That -- those -- those matters are quite irrespective of whether the -- the picketing, the obstruction is engaged in for the purpose of coercing employees and their right or whether it is engaged in for the purpose of -- of merely keeping people out, business out or whether it's out for the purpose of keeping visitors out for any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.467" offset="9221851">That -- that is proscribed because of the public interest and the interest of the third parties which has been pronounced by the legislature there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.274" offset="9253094">And the National Labor Relations Board itself has recognized that it has no authority and -- and will not try to proscribe mass picketing as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.113" offset="9304398">It says -- it said in the Corey Corporation case signed and cited in the brief that it had no authority to affirmatively regulate the number of persons who may probably picket an establishment, it's -- and said then that is primarily a matter for local authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.407" offset="9377541">All right, now, another part, the other part of the Board's order, Sections 1 and 2 of the proscription are the ones, I believe, on which counsel primarily relies in his suggestion that there has been an infringement of preempted area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.006" offset="9451938">The Board, however, referring thereto for making any decision as to who were or who were not entitled to protections as employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.919" offset="9499585">As I pointed out, the state law does have a parallel provisions, Section 8 (b) (1) which proscribes or makes it an unfair practice to coerce employees in their enjoinment of their legal rights guaranteed by -- in this federal law at Section 7 and the state law at section 111.04 (4) I think it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.842" offset="9591327">The Board may absolutely no reference to that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.695" offset="9606687">It did not refer to employees nor did it -- it proscribed coercion of employees in their rights as employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.727" offset="9642841">It referred to the Section -- the portion of that Section of the law which does proscribe coercion by picketing domiciles and that's the only part of that provision of the law which paralleled the federal law which was referred to by the State Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.541" offset="9714103">And that matter, a picketing of domiciles per se is not covered by the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.257" offset="9736986">Now, the State Board in its order proscribed not coercion of employees but coercion of persons desiring to be employed by the Kohler Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.643" offset="9782544">And now, the first reason they did that was a recognition undoubtedly that if any disciplinary action were exerted by the employer, it would be for the National Labor Relations Board to -- to decide whether these people were or were not employees, so the Board -- State Board hasn't tried on that face of the matter at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.746" offset="9874913">Secondly, it -- it made it clear, though there are many people who wanted to apply for jobs that were not -- couldn't, under any circumstances, be considered employees who couldn't even get in to file their applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.043" offset="9920157">So, the Board said, “You shan't coerce a person desiring to be employed."</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.111" offset="9952444">And then it says, “You shan't coerce them with respect to legal rights," not the legal rights guaranteed under Section 111.04 or the legal rights guaranteed by Section 7 of the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.815" offset="9999256">There has been no reference to that and that's a very significant omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.790" offset="10015138">The Board is distinguishing and -- and prohibiting the infringement upon people's right to be free in using the streets going where they please from attack, from obstruction and that sort of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.177" offset="12736679">Pleadings that have been put into appellant's appendix show this in regard to that proceeding which is currently going on before the National Labor Relations Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.282" offset="12885055">And that as a result of that course of conduct on the part of the union, we were relieved of the duty to bargain with the union during the period while that conduct was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.655" offset="12934583">We put in evidence to support that defense that is we have attempted to prove to the Board that the union did in fact engage in this violent conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.678" offset="12978678">We say, Your Honors, that there is no possibility of conflict in that situation for this simple reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.958" offset="13011801">Nothing that Wisconsin has done can possibly interfere with any action that the Board may take on our proof of that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.669" offset="13054642">If the National Labor Relations Board concludes that in fact the union's conduct was unlawful, it will then come to the legal question of whether that unlawful conduct was a sufficient excuse for our declining to bargain during the period while the unlawful conduct continued.</text>

            <text syncTime="3983.042" offset="15932082">Do you claim that the Board, the Wisconsin Board, was lending itself to an attempt of the Kohler Company to have its dispute with the union adjudicated in a state jurisdiction rather than the -- the Board?</text>

            <text syncTime="3997.694" offset="15990700">Certainly, that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.289" offset="15997074">The Kohler Company could have filed charges substantially similar to those filed in the state complaint before the federal board and could have had them heard there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.394" offset="16041482">There's no question that the federal board would have had jurisdiction over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.610" offset="16058410">Wisconsin -- the Kohler Company elected to take its complaint before the Wisconsin Board and in that sense, the -- the Kohler Company, of course, is in the position of shopping for its form which we are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.303" offset="16125179">And the counsel for Kohler Company demonstrated in this connection that the issues in this dispute are interrelated because they are -- have finding it necessary to plead some of the same things that were pleaded before the state board before the federal board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.863" offset="16199367">And as I argued yesterday, we were unable to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.915" offset="16219638">In other words, we have claimed that the Kohler Company has engaged in course of conduct of various kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.157" offset="16248581">We attempted to defend in the state proceeding on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.866" offset="16263419">We were told by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin and I read from its decision on page 13 of the record, "Appellant's brief asserts that the Kohler Company has in its plant the supply of clubs, guns and tear gas and they submit that it is unjust for the state agencies to restrain the actions of appellants while doing nothing about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.434" offset="16337711">If the appellants considered or do now consider the presence of these munitions wrongful as an unfair labor practice, they could and still can petition the Board for its abatement."</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.182" offset="16376686">Well, the fact of the matter is that we could not do that because as I understand the decisions of the Court, one thing is quite plain, employer unfair labor practices subject to federal regulation as these would be are no longer subject to state board regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.508" offset="16449933">Therefore, we were unable to have our conduct adjudicated in its context and in its relationship to the company's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.272" offset="16501029">And in other -- put another way, the Wisconsin Board, conceding all of this about employer unfair labor practices, is asserting the right to adjudicate certain union unfair labor practices as an exception to the general rule and in isolation in a vacuum unrelated to the other conduct in a complex labor dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="4275.740" offset="17102890">Now, with respect to persons desiring to be employed rather than employees, I would suggest that this Court has held that a person not yet employed but at the point of employment enjoys the statutory rights of employees under the federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.092" offset="17184287">And consequently -- consequently, a person wanting to be employed by Kohler Company, whom the Kohler Company wants to employ, would be an employee entitled to the protection of the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.276" offset="17241025">Now, we concede that the federal board would have no jurisdiction over, let us say, customers of the Kohler Company or other business visitors.</text>

            <text syncTime="4355.285" offset="17421061">And I am advised by my associate from Wisconsin that as a matter of fact, the Wisconsin Board does not take complaints from anyone other than employers, employees and labor unions.</text>
