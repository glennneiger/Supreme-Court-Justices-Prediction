            <text syncTime="752.776" offset="3011082">This Court there said, “In unrestricted submission such as the present margin agreements envisage, the interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard are not subject in federal courts to judicial review for error and interpretation."</text>
            <text syncTime="770.264" offset="3080986">And then a little later, they went on and referring to the Boyd case, they said, “We said in that case that the right to select the forum even after the creation of a liability as a substantial right and that the agreement restricting the choice would forth the expressed purpose of that statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="794.407" offset="3177535">Now, in other words, I interpret that as meaning that in a situation which is rather similar, this right to choose a forum, and in that case it was a right to choose between a court of law and arbitrators, there's a substantial right in the Guaranty Trust sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.376" offset="8169430">We feel that the contract itself here is very important in determining whether or not we have a right to a stay with the Circuit Court in this manner ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.551" offset="8230139">Now as has been stated, both parties to this contract were residents of the State in New York at the time the contract was drawn and executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.003" offset="8279980">It contemplated and the contract was drawn in New York as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.712" offset="8302759">The contract contemplated that the petitioner here would go to Vermont on at least some has served since the major part of it probably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.964" offset="8347794">The contract is executed on August 1st, 1952 and about that day, the petitioner did remove to Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.143" offset="8376529">His employment continued only until the end of October -- towards the end of October when he was dismissed or the relation of his duties as he claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.016" offset="8423967">That was in 1952, and in February of this year, the petitioner started his breach of contract action in the county court in Bennington County, and was removed by us to the federal court by reason of diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.730" offset="8482900">We filed our answer indicating that we denied his rights to recover on the breach and set up a counterclaim showing damage to the respondent here of substantially the same and surmount as is was claimed by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.351" offset="8545384">At about that same date, we proceeded under the contract provisions to institute arbitration proceedings in New York through respondent's New York counsel, that was instituted and service made upon the petitioner here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.150" offset="8692506">And that was done and proper bond, filed it under standards, no question for proper arbitration proceedings were instituted in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.003" offset="8732003">Very shortly there afterwards, the day or two later, we moved for a stay in the District Court to permit us to continue with the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.767" offset="8779024">That matter was heard and the Court denied it, not our motion for stay on the ground, the Court held that Erie-Tompkins did control here, and we filed our appeal which was heard by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.174" offset="8844643">And that Circuit in the unanimous opinion ruled that we were entitled for the stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.243" offset="8868885">Certiorari was then allowed here and that brings us to this present point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.536" offset="8898142">Now, I think unimportant to call the Court's attention, I think this may as we conceive it be decisible, this whole issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.307" offset="8949133">And that is that when the contract is drawn and executed, there was inserted therein paragraph 11, “The parties hereto -- hereto do here agree that any differences claimed, no matter a dispute arise between them out of this agreement or connected herewith shall be submitted by them to arbitration by the American Arbitration Society or its successor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.265" offset="9045055">And that the determination of said American Arbitration Association or its successors or any arbitrators appointed -- designated by the said association on such matters shall be final and absolute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.539" offset="9090090">And then it goes on to say that the arbitration shall be conducted under the pertinent sections of the New York Civil Practice Act relating to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.396" offset="9125512">But a further provision that we consider very important is paragraph 14 of the contract, and that is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.322" offset="9157277">"In short the parties hereto do hereby stipulate and agree, that is their intention and covenant that this agreement forums hereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.928" offset="9195624">And all suits and special proceedings hereunder, be construed in accordance with and under and pursuant to the laws of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.147" offset="9232509">And that many special -- any actions, special proceeding, or other proceeding that may be brought arising out of or in connection with over reasons of agreement, the laws of the State of New York shall be applicable and shall govern to the exclusion of the law of any other forum without regard to the jurisdiction in which any action or special proceeding may be instituted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.133" offset="9884526">But we say that -- that those two clauses of the contract are very pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.474" offset="9929874">Now, the -- my brothers have been asked by Justice Frankfurter and others as to whether or not we had any lower court rulings determining how matters of this nature would be handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.288" offset="10009078">In the first case to come before the New York courts on this was the Marchant against Mead-Morrison Company and decided by the New York Court of Appeals in 1929 after the determination after the passing of the arbitration statute in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.516" offset="10090057">Now, that was a case in which a main corporation contracted to sell and deliver tractors to a New York corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.538" offset="10122136">The contract is executed in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.492" offset="10133943">The tractors were to be manufactured and delivered to Massachusetts, and the contract contained an arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.362" offset="10181381">It doesn't set up in the arbitration clause that it was the arbitrations to be under the New York state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.802" offset="10207190">Now, that was brought -- arbitration was sought in that case in the courts of New York and the Court of Appeals had the following question, “Did the Supreme Court or judge there power -- have power under Section 4 of the New York law to appoint a third arbitrator?</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.694" offset="10278766">It appears that their arbitration agreement called for each party to appoint an arbitrator, and those two were to appoint a third.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.933" offset="10311680">But each party did appoint an arbitrator and they couldn't agree upon the third, and they appealed to the Court of New York to have the third one appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.513" offset="10345953">And the Court did appoint the third arbitrator, and objection was made there to the seller, the one who didn't want the arbitration in New York, attack the legality of the order on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.183" offset="10396630">On the first point, argues that the arbitration provision as quoted above provided for arbitration in Massachusetts and nowhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.281" offset="10429022">And therefore, New York had no power to act under Section 4 of the New York Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.817" offset="10455249">Judge Cardozo wrote the opinion in that case, and if I may quote from the latter part of one paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.911" offset="10491611">Judge Cardozo said, "This remedy may lawfully be extended to contracts of manufacture made in Massachusetts and there to be performed unless it is one of the terms of arbitration clause implied if not expressed that the arbitration shall proceed in a -- in a particular locality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.973" offset="10567889">Express restriction there is none in the contract now before us, whether one as to be implied is the question of intention to determine in the light of the context annotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.229" offset="10608849">This is what was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.996" offset="10615954">The Court discharged of its judicial function was called upon to declare the implications of the promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.029" offset="10636016">We do not say at this time the determination is free from error and not for the present purposes that is not to be ignored as void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.001" offset="10667990">In other words, and in that case, the constitutionality of the New York Arbitration Act was gone into and rather determined by Judge Cardozo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.147" offset="10712503">Now, there, serious case where case where the only connection that any of the parties or any of the agreement had to New York in the actual contract is a fact that one of the parties was a New York corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.132" offset="10788467">We have the next case in the matter of Gant and the situation of parties in the terms of arbitration or as follows that both parties were at all times none resident of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.532" offset="10850116">The arbitration provision called for arbitration in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.075" offset="10868297">That was the -- one of the parties was a resident in North Carolina and the other was in Nicaraguan company, and a disagreement arose and the Nicaraguan company sought arbitration in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.744" offset="10918975">The Gant didn't reply but petition for a stay of the arbitration in New York, that's the North Carolina party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.017" offset="10960039">He argued the law on that -- of -- under the law of North Carolina, arbitration provision was void and therefore the New York courts could not force him to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.008" offset="10995984">The trial court and the Court of Appeals found that the arbitration was not void, it was merely voidable in North Carolina, and his petition for a stay of the arbitration proceedings was denied and the arbitration was carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.728" offset="11062857">Now, the Court of Appeals in its decision used this language, “The place of performance of the arbitration section, though not other parts of the September agreement was to be in New York.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.446" offset="11121685">New York statute, that's the Civil Practice Act in Section -- paragraph 84, provides complete compulsion and full enforcement as to such promises to arbitrate future-arising disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.313" offset="11181244">And apparently on the strength of that, that was the nub of their decision in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.619" offset="11206426">And further they said, some of the parties solemnly promise to arbitrate their controversies in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.860" offset="11235370">And by a case in statute law of New York then was and now is that such an agreement is a consent of the parties thereto to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of this State to enforce such contract for such submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.698" offset="11302766">Now, that of course is less strong than the case before the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.536" offset="11326067">Then there's one other case that is reported without opinion in which there were two New York corporations, also is in New York, entered a commercial contract in New York and had a -- an arbitration provision in their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.462" offset="11409763">Later, both parties moved to Connecticut, dispute arose, one party petitioned for arbitration in New York and the other party moved for a stay of the arbitration proceedings because a civil case had been commenced in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.958" offset="11479771">The Court denied that motion, ordered arbitration to proceed and said that even though the case was pending in Connecticut, there was nothing inconsistent in there allowing arbitration since that was the sense of the contract and the agreement made by the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.460" offset="11557825">The judge said in so rolling, called the contract in 1936 was made this day by New York corporations therefore has consent to the jurisdiction of this Court to enforce the contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.643" offset="11602547">Now briefly, your -- that covers our situation to their brief, some other matters here but here we have two New York parties contracting to arbitrate under the laws of the State of New York, and that all the laws of the State of New York would apply to their contract regardless of whatever the law might be of any other forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.371" offset="11705469">We say that by reason of that, the District Court of Vermont should have and was required to allow our petition and grant our motion because the Court in Vermont should be, as the New York case have held, bound by the contract into which the parties entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.185" offset="11816647">And if the -- the -- since the arbitration had been commenced that we were entitled to the stay to permit completion of the arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="4569.166" offset="18276624">Now, Mr. McNamara started to read that up, so it's a pretty good idea that we're construing an agreement to have the agreement here before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.289" offset="18345064">"The parties hereto do agree that any differences, claim, or matter in dispute arising between them out of this agreement or connected herewith shall be submitted by them to arbitration, by the American Arbitration Association or its successor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.690" offset="18406713">And that the determination of the American Arbitration Association or its successors or any arbitrators designated by said association on such matters shall be final and absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.318" offset="18457182">The said arbitrator shall be governed by the duly promulgated rules and regulations, the American Arbitration Association or its successor and the pertinent provisions of the Civil Practice Act for the State of New York relating to arbitrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.425" offset="18509636">The decision of the arbitrator may be entered as a judgment in any court of the State of New York or elsewhere."</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.793" offset="18539102">And in this fourteenth article, they expressly incorporate this New York law in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.025" offset="18560000">So this contract embodied this New York doctrine as a part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.891" offset="18579540">And these provisions, Section 1450, of course we have the basic provision in Section 1448 which says that these agreements shall hereafter be valid, enforceable, and irrevocable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.040" offset="18632098">Now, the legislature conceivably could have put a period to the statute right there and that would have been the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.252" offset="18652996">That I guess, everyone would say that sounds pretty substantive and we might not be arguing this remedy business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.783" offset="18679118">Well, they didn't do that in order to implement this declaration that it was valid, enforceable, and irrevocable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.740" offset="18706913">They went ahead and provided that when you make an agreement in New York, you consent in advance to the jurisdiction of the New York -- the courts over your person, so that you can't defeat the agreement by leaving the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.152" offset="18764591">They provided for a stay in Section 1451, not exactly the same stay we're asking for but a stay under their statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.555" offset="18798132">In 1452, they gave the power to name an arbitrator and that stops all this chicanery of writings for scratching every name off the list that's submitted to you so that you can put it off indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.987" offset="18843899">1461, they said that this award could become a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.029" offset="18860095">In 1466, they said it will have the same force and effect as a judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.685" offset="18882664">The cases which have come up under the statute amply are a fruition of these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.502" offset="18913907">There is the -- the Marsh case, a Massachusetts contract made in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.222" offset="18936790">Performance of the container contracts certainly at Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.547" offset="18950165">Nothing said about the place of performance of the arbitration clause and main in New York parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.516" offset="18973989">The New York Court of Appeals had no difficulty in saying that this thing should be enforced according to its terms, and they presented a moving party with a judgement which was entitled the full faith and credit in other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.489" offset="19025920">But there has incidentally been since the Shafer v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, so far as I know, there has been no -- no quarrel about the effect of these ex parte awards.</text>

            <text syncTime="5934.281" offset="23737051">Now, in the very case which they have cited at length with regard to the view of Vermont case of conflicting policies, the Brown against Perry case, I should point out that in that case, it involves an application of the Hew Hampshire wrongful death action, if I remember rightly, in Vermont courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.384" offset="23821479">Now, Vermont had a wrong -- wrongful death statute at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5958.872" offset="23835481">There was no conflict of policy there as such but in fact, the people who won in that case won a pyrrhic victory in a way because the reason they wanted the New Hampshire statute was because the measure of damages was much broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.922" offset="23899638">It include pain and suffering of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.200" offset="23908728">And at that time, all Vermont permitted was loss to the next of keen, pecuniarily loss to the next of keen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.021" offset="23940075">And it is a striking fact that the Court in that Brown against Perry case decided that, "Yes, we apply the Vermont -- the New Hampshire statue in Vermont as to wrongful death.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.567" offset="23994201">But the measure of damages being a matter of remedy, we apply."</text>
