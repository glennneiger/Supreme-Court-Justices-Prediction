        <section startTime="0" stopTime="1758.52">
          <heading>Argument of Truman M. Hobbs</heading>
          <turn speaker="truman_m_hobbs" startTime="0.000" stopTime="501.478">
            <label>Mr. Truman M. Hobbs</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">The petitioner was an independent contractor engaged in the business of unloading tank cars of gasoline for delivery to local consignees of that gas in Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.192" offset="52767">The petitioner, Mr. Shields, went upon the tank car that, from which he suffered his injury, called the purpose of unloading this gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.394" offset="97489">It is necessary on the type of the tank car that he was working upon for him to climb to the dome of the tank which is some 10 feet in the air to release the -- open the dome and to turn the valve.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.949" offset="159765">There is a board there at the top of a short ladder, right there at the dome, which is put there for the primary purpose of having people stand there while they do the operation that petitioner was about to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.707" offset="234789">This board was admittedly so rotten that it crumbles in your hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.549" offset="262165">When petitioner stepped upon this board, it fell to the ground and he fell with it, suffering severe injuries to his back, and was permanently injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.239" offset="312947">The case went to the jury, the District Court lay on Montgomery on two counts of a complaint, one sounding in common law of negligence, the other relying on the Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.178" offset="364669">The jury rendered a general verdict in the amount of $7500 and the District Court affirmed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.911" offset="395598">The case then was appealed to the Court of Appeals in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.624" offset="414407">That Court found that it could not determine whether the jury had decided then on the ground of common law of negligence or on the ground of Safety Appliance Act and sets in the view of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.438" offset="473652">The Safety Appliance Act was not properly invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.552" offset="486191">It remanded the case to the District Court for trial on common law negligence grounds alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.843" offset="511269">It was the theory of the Court of Appeals that the failure of the I.C.C. to issue any regulations standardizing this appliance, which we call a running board, was conclusive proof of an administrative determination that this board was not a safety appliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.284" offset="609071">It was from that judgment of the Court of Appeals that this petition of certiorari was filed and that the case is now here.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.555" offset="642194">Now the -- our case is very simply stated, the theory on which we rely for recovery is this, the Section 11 of the Safety Appliance Act states that all cars requiring secure ladders and running boards shall be equipped with such ladders and running boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.392" offset="725473">This was a running board, it was insecure and rotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.408" offset="745535">Petitioner stepped on it and fell to the painful injuries which there's no dispute about.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.843" offset="775314">Now, to this simple statement of our theory of recovery, the defendant has -- our respondent here has raised three defenses which we'd like to discuss with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.807" offset="823171">The first defense raised by respondent is that this is not a running board because it was not standardized by the I.C.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.516" offset="862041">And respondent, in his brief, condemns petitioner for what he calls petitioner's persistent assumption that this was a running board.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.004" offset="903941">And an answer to that is simply this, that the Railroad was just as persistent in calling this a running board until the railroad was confronted with a violation of those -- with the Safety Appliance Act provisions about having a running board secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.112" offset="972382">The railroads repair order, which was put in evidence in this case, showed that the railroad called it a dome running board.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.123" offset="1004460">The superintendent of the railroad in answering interrogatories propounded to the railroad by the petitioner, Shields, answered no less than seven times calling this a running board.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.276" offset="1065064">Even on the trial, the counsel saw the railroad and witnesses called by the railroad referred to it on more than one occasion as a running board.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.007" offset="1108010">This idea that it's not a running board is something fair at length that has been thought of by the railroad and the railroad is upset because petitioner won't join the railroad in its inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.033" offset="1156075">But the sole basis on which the railroad relies in its contention that this is not a running board is the absence of any regulations on the subject by the I.C.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.846" offset="1199334">And as we shall demonstrate the failure of the I.C.C. to standardize this appliance has absolutely no significance in determining whether this is in fact the running board.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.948" offset="1247713">The I.C.C. has filed a brief in this case in which it acknowledges that the ladder which goes to this running board is also not standardized.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.771" offset="1299017">Now, the I.C.C. doesn't contend that that ladder is in a lesser ladder because of its failure to standardize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.717" offset="1326811">And we can't see why this running board should be designated as any lesser running board because of its failure to standardize.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.108" offset="1360353">The I.C.C. contends that it has failed to standardize this appliance because it is not an appliance which is primarily used in the movement of a train.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.566" offset="1406224">And we want to discuss in a few minutes the -- what we think is the erroneous ground for not so regarding it as a safety appliance, that is the ground offered by the I.C.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.875" offset="1467455">We think that when Congress used the term "running board", it must have used it with reference to railroad pallets.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.353" offset="1505384">Now, the term was designated in railroad pallets and this record as has already been shown is full of evidence, almost without dispute, that this appliance is known in railroad pallets as the running board.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.985" offset="1563899">There is some evidence in the record that some employees call it a dome step board, and in that connection, Webster's New International Dictionary defines a running board as a clip board.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.692" offset="1618756">So, we think that the term is certainly synonymous but the evidence also is clear in the record that the car inspector with 25 years of experience on the railroad says that it's always -- it's known by him as a dome running board or a top running board.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.201" offset="1676748">So there was adequate evidence for the trial court to have found as it did find that this was the running board and submit the question of whether that running board was secure to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.336" offset="1721260">Now, I think the principal argument of the I.C.C. -- of the railroad here, however, is that even if this be a running board, the omission of the I.C.C. to standardize it means that it is not a safety appliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.030" offset="1784059">Now, this contention is based on the railroad's conception that when Congress gave in Section 12, the authority to the I.C.C. to standardized these appliances that it was also giving to the I.C.C. the right to say which appliances shall be secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.947" offset="1879771">We point out, however, that Section 11 of the Act just simply says all cars requiring secure ladders and secure running boards shall be equipped with such ladders and running boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.861" offset="1939435">And then, Section 12 gives the I.C.C. the right to standardize those appliances.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.391" offset="1969528">We submit that the railroad is omitting to note the interplay of these two sections.</text>

            <label>Mr. Truman M. Hobbs</label>
            <text syncTime="528.839" offset="2115291">Section 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.797" offset="2139115">That -- that says the number, dimensions, location and manner of application of the appliances provided for by Section 4 and 11, this title is designated by the Interstate Commerce Commission shall remain as the standards of equipment to be used on all cars subject to the provisions of Section 11 and 16 of this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.011" offset="2223961">And then down further, it says that failure to comply with any requirement of the Interstate Commerce Commission shall be subject to a light penalty as failure to comply with any requirement of Sections 11 and 16 of this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.605" offset="2286341">So, we submit that Congress clearly had its eye on two -- two enables.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.153" offset="2308598">One was the failure of railroads in many cases to keep these appliances secure and that's what Section 11 was designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.563" offset="2346214">Section 12 was designed to prevent the evil of not having these appliances standardized so that on a dark night of railroad employee might reach for a handhold that he might think should be there or a running board that is ordinarily there and might not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.744" offset="2406922">So those were the two enables but we submit that by giving as -- the I.C.C. the authority to standardize these appliances, there was no intent on Congress, whatsoever, to take it away from its clear command in Section 11 that running boards and ladders be maintained in a secure condition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1303.436" offset="5213727">Well, let me go just a minute into the reason advanced by the I.C.C. for this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.664" offset="5230655">As I say, in fact, I think they're incorrect in saying that this board is not using the movement of cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.237" offset="5248940">The evidence in the record from a car inspector with 25 years experience was it -- it frequently mean when I found this board to pass hand signals that if it -- if the dome top on this car became loose in the movement of the train and if the railroad employee might have to go up there to -- and he'd seen employees have to go up there to tap that thing down with gasoline on the inside and its dome tank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.307" offset="5349146">Not racking up and down, I think the Court can readily see the necessity for getting up there in such a circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.048" offset="5372134">But the main thing that the I.C.C. says is not supported by anything in the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.037" offset="5400137">If Congress said they intended only those running boards used in the movement of a car to be standardized, Congress clearly could have so stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.054" offset="5440157">It is true, as the I.C.C. says in its brief, I supposed, that Congress had its attention primarily focused on the toll of accidents that occurred to employees on moving trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.167" offset="5488640">But Congress didn't seem fit to say that only running boards used in the movement of trains were covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.846" offset="5523331">The I.C.C. has simply -- with -- by sharing interest inserted those words in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.099" offset="5552379">I think Congress was aware that a fall from the top of a -- top running board was just as serious as a fall from a bottom running board and would never have made the -- inserted the words of the I.C.C. has cited -- isn't cited in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.596" offset="5626358">Now, I'd like to mention for just a minute, the argument of the railroad and the I.C.C. that the words in Section 11 where it says that all cars requiring secure running boards means all cars required by the I.C.C. to have secure running boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.290" offset="5705143">There again, they have simply inserted into the act language that Congress didn't seem fit to insert for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.252" offset="5736908">We think, if you read these -- these sections -- Section 11 as a whole, it's readily apparent what Congress had in mind by the use of the word requiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.911" offset="5775569">It said all cars must be equipped with secure sill steps and efficient handbrakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.986" offset="5799915">All cars requiring secure ladders and secure running boards shall be equipped with such because all cars do not require ladders and running boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.164" offset="5848607">A gondola car, for example, has no running board on it, and Congress was not attempting to require the railroad to go to useless expense and put running boards where it -- where they weren't needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.846" offset="5899285">And again, in the Williams case, the Court gave the language requiring, we submit its proper interpretation which was cars requiring for their proper use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.161" offset="5936588">These running boards shall be equipped with such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.369" offset="5957381">And the last comment I'd like to make on that construction is that the tense of the word "requiring" would be all wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.821" offset="5991236">If Congress in Section 11 were referencing regulations of the I.C.C. because at the time Congress wrote Section 11, there were no regulations by the I.C.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.777" offset="6043063">So, if they'd any I.C.C. regulations in mind, they certainly would have said because -- which shall be required to have secure running boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.249" offset="6088934">So we submit that the omission of the I.C.C. to standardize this appliance cannot take away the protection that Congress was plainly trying to give employees in Section 11 that railroads must maintain running boards in a secure manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.576" offset="6406269">But we see no practical reason why they should free as the design of tank cars, some cars have it, some don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.305" offset="6433123">But if a car is designed that requires for its proper use of this type of running board, then it has to be secure whether the I.C.C. sees fit to standardize that appliance or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.648" offset="6482547">And the reason the I.C.C. gives for its failure to standardize is the reason that it inserts into Section 11 by share inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.524" offset="6522044">There is not a word in Section 11 to indicate that Congress didn't intend running boards on the top of cars to be maintained securely just as they intended that running boards on the bottom of a car be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.500" offset="7049927">The District Judge on the contrary told the jury that they need to make no finding as to that answer of the term in general verdict and need not to say which count is a basic point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.032" offset="7100082">Now, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.558" offset="7106142">This plaintiff of the course still has, under the Circuit Court decision, the right to go back and get a trial on the count of common law negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.044" offset="7140101">As to the Safety Appliance Act, we say, in our brief two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.977" offset="7163820">We say it first that the Act does not require this board and we also say that the Safety Appliance Act is not available to this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.623" offset="7214393">It appears in the brief and I have to call attention to it, the reply brief especially the statement is in there, inadvertently, I'm sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.521" offset="7262041">On page 12, that it is undisputed that its effective car was then used on respondent's line at the time of the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.264" offset="7297045">We respectfully dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.860" offset="7307389">The entire record shows this car had been delivered on a private chauffeur to an industry and totally disconnected from the line of the railroad and was sitting there in their control and in their possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.775" offset="7371024">This man was an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.787" offset="7379069">He testified that he worked at filling stations on such things as gasoline pumps and he was available to these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.057" offset="7412193">Incidentally, the record will also show on page 122, the witness, Watkins, who was the helper of the plaintiff, testified that the petitioner first went upon the running board and made some adjustments and connections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.933" offset="7475722">Then he came down to make the holes or fixed the holes at the bottom and return to the running board having to send his helper up because he was only showing his helper how this thing was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.322" offset="7521280">And it was not until both of them at their weight upon this dome step board that it broke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.887" offset="7563494">It doesn't necessarily affect the legal problem confronting the Court but the petitioner passed over this board twice that are levered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.214" offset="7596826">And of course, so does his helper and there was no apparent defect.</text>
