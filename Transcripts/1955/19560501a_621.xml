            <label>Mr. Joseph S. Lord, III</label>
            <text syncTime="33.277" offset="133016">May it please the Court, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.795" offset="147122">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to review the decision of that Court affirming the decision of the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania which dismissed the petitioner's complaint filed in that court under the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.764" offset="247014">The question of coverage was raised by a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.823" offset="267285">The District Court decided it adversely to the plaintiff and dismissed the action because without the federal jurisdiction, there being no diversity, there was no basis for federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.684" offset="330710">The action arises out of an accident which happened on July 19th, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.364" offset="357355">Erroneously stated in our brief as July 15th, 1951, although I think the typographical error is not material.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.377" offset="389433">The accident happened at the 32nd Street Office building of the respondent, defendant Railroad Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.807" offset="427154">That was in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.139" offset="436454">At that office, and these facts are without contradiction, there are on file some 325,000 original tracings from which blueprints are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.709" offset="502805">The tracings cover and the blueprints made from them also cover every single part of the respondent's system, all of its mechanical equipment, all of its cars, all of its locomotives, its engines, its bridges, its package.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.776" offset="583053">It covers the entire system which extends into ten different states and the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.075" offset="616281">It is the only place on the entire system where these original tracings are kept and it is the only on the entire system where the blueprints are made for the use in shops and in repairing of trucks, bridges, and other structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.350" offset="689319">Sixty seven percent of the blueprints that are made in the 32nd Street Office building or 32nd Street Office building, yes, go into states other than Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.598" offset="742296">And the cars which they cover, of course, are operated over the respondent's entire 10 state and District of Columbia system.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.981" offset="783882">The method in which the work is done is that orders come in from the various repair shops which themselves are located in various parts of the country for the blueprints that are needed in order to maintain, repair and keep functioning the respondent's equipment and trackage.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.462" offset="877819">The prints were made, as I say, in the 32nd Street Office and are then sent to the various repair shops where the work of maintenance and repair is done or to the various locations where the track work is done or where track repairs are done.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.460" offset="949812">The plaintiff's position in this scheme of things was the duty of picking up in the mornings the orders as they came in from the various repair shops.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.456" offset="1001744">The orders would call for a specified blueprint of a specified car or track or whatever it maybe, and it was her duty to select from among the 325,000 original tracings that were on file there, the proper one so that the proper blueprint could be made from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.255" offset="1088993">She would then take the -- the original tracing having selected it from its proper place in the file and having made the proper selection to the blueprint maker who would make from that, from her selection the blueprint that the tracing called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.570" offset="1170181">She also had the correlative and equally important duty of replacing in its proper place in the files the original tracing.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.888" offset="1211455">I say an important duty because obviously, it was important that she get it back in the right place so that the next person looking for it wouldn't have to look through 325,000 original tracings before they came across it.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.769" offset="1271014">On these facts, the District Court and the Circuit Court in affirming held that the -- in effect, that the petitioner's duties did not further interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.849" offset="1339350">As we see it, the lower court, and I'm speaking here of the Court of Appeals, fell into two basic and fundamental errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.847" offset="1383340">Fundamental errors which require, it seems to us, reversal and fundamental errors which were allowed to go uncorrected would emasculate the 1939 Amendment to the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.708" offset="1450736">The first error into which the Court fell was its unstated premise although nonetheless clearly apparent from its opinion that the words interstate commerce, in the -- even in the amended Act were equated with what we may call the classical staff of railroading, the engines, the breaks, the tracks and the switches.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.966" offset="1567765">And that almost physical proximity, physical contact with this stuff of railroading was required in order for an employee to be covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.035" offset="1628056">Now that truncated view, if you will, of the Act fails utterly to give any significance whatsoever to the enlarging words of the 1939 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.199" offset="1696705">And here it's important, it seems to me, to contrast the words that were used in the 1939 amendment with the language that was used in the original act or rather the second act of 1908.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.304" offset="1757205">I say second because as Your Honors know, the first was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.092" offset="1776327">The language of the Act of 1908 and significantly enough continued on without change in the first paragraph of the amended Act of 1939 was, that the carrier was liable for injuries to any of its employees who were injured while employed in such commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.166" offset="1876637">This Court early and continuously construed commerce in that sense to mean transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.333" offset="1913313">Therefore, under the 1939 Act or the 1908 Act, the criterion for coverage was actual employment in transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.242" offset="1964931">Now, the 1939 Act, however, went far beyond that and as opposed to employment in commerce, merely stated as the touchstone that the duties shall be in furtherance of interstate or foreign commerce or shall, in anyway, directly or closely and substantially affect such commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.587" offset="2518309">But precisely what Congress did, it seems to me, is that the word commerce and the words interstate commerce as embodied in the 1939 amendment, actually embraced a different concept from the pre-1939 concept of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.322" offset="2593228">And if I may illustrate that Mister -- Mr. Hildebrand started me on it perhaps, but if we look at this lectern as he did, as being transportation, then the imposition of the employee on that and that I consider to be engagement in rather than mere furtherance of but engagement in.</text>

            <text syncTime="848.245" offset="3392888">That error, I think, and by the way while I'm addressing myself to that, may I say just one word on this so-called moment of injury test.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.450" offset="3433744">There seems to be a question of whether or not, the Act did not merely do away with the moment of injury test.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.418" offset="3469584">I suggest to Your Honors, that -- that if that had been the mere intent of Congress, they could simply have added to sect -- to paragraph 1 of the Act of 1908 the words instead of saying, any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce, simply by amending that to read, any person suffering injury, any part of whose duties shall be employment by such carrier in such commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.495" offset="3613884">In other words, it is the phrase in any part which does away with the so-called moment of injury rule, and the phrase “in furtherance of” which broadens the scope of the type of employee and the type of job which is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.923" offset="3683683">Now, the second error, I think, into -- and this I think is fatal into which the Court of Appeals fell was the error of what you might call job label or job status.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.421" offset="3741675">That is attaching some importance and in fact almost transcendent importance to the relative importance of the job in the hierarchy of the railroad echelons or determining upon a label, i.e., clerical worker and using the label without regard to the job function and through the job function its impact upon interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.954" offset="3859749">The label itself is of no importance whatsoever whether Ms. Reed be called a clerk or a blueprint executive is of no importance whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.493" offset="7461930">It's Footnote 66 halfway down, the Southern Pacific versus Industrial Accident, that should be second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.798" offset="7495158">Now if Your Honors please, to narrow the issue here a little bit, all the counsel that have argued this morning, I think, would agree that the main purpose or certainly a purpose of the 1939 amendment was to abolish the moment of injury rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.865" offset="7595363">And the issue, it seems to me is, did it enlarge coverage beyond bringing in those employees who were formally barred by that rule or did it do -- did it -- did it enlarge it or did it do nothing more than abolish that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.392" offset="7673522">Now, the petitioner concedes in this case, concedes that all employees are not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.253" offset="7704973">I think counsel is impelled to make that admission because it would have been so very easy for Congress to have written this Act in terms that would have covered all employees had it had any intention to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.444" offset="7781773">Two years before in the railroad at the time enacted had done exactly that, the year before in the railroad and Employment Insurance Act had had also brought in all employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.558" offset="7826181">There's no question whatever despite the Howard case decision that Congress was aware of the fact that in 1939, under the decisions of this Court, the entire railroad industry was subject to regulation certainly insofar as supply relationship were concerned if it is so intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.075" offset="7912281">We concede of course that the result of this amendment was enormously to broaden the coverage of the Act because after the 1939 amendment, all transportation employees whether they were engaged in intrastate commerce or interstate commerce for all intents and purposes were brought within the scope of the Act the minute the moment of entry will -- was abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.975" offset="8023876">Of course, it had a very broad effect on -- on shop employees also soon as a -- an engine, any instrumentality of transportation was being repaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.038" offset="8076121">The mere fact that at the very moment of the man's injury, that he was working on a dead locomotive, no longer was he barred, he was recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.706" offset="8110811">Now, counsel have made a very fleeting reference to the first paragraph of the first section of the Act, which is in the 1939 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.648" offset="8178521">In other words, Section 1 of the Act is composed of two paragraphs of which the first paragraph was in the 1908 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.543" offset="8222093">And that the reenactment of that section carried with it, of course, the gloss of this Court's construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.801" offset="8263158">And when Mr. Hildebrand this morning said that all the cases that were decided before 1939 should be cast into limbo, he utterly ignores the principle that when this -- when this Court interprets a -- a paragraph such as the first paragraph of this section has been reenacted that you can't just throw into limbo all the cases cited by this Court under that section before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.406" offset="8389590">They are part of the warp and woof and they're still before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.606" offset="8406413">So that in attempting to find the meaning of the 1939 amendment, we have to start not with the second paragraph, and start worrying about furtherance, but we have to start with the reenacted paragraph 1 and see what this Court had said that meant prior to 1939 because since Congress reenacted that paragraph, there's an inference at least that -- that everything that had been said about it before still stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.247" offset="8524904">Now, there were several points of great importance with reference to that first paragraph which were briefly mentioned this morning but I want to repeat them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.677" offset="8578612">In the first place, in the Shanks case, Your Honor said that commerce meant transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.644" offset="8614557">And again and again and again, this Court went back to the Shanks case until finally in 1932 in the Ball case, the Court said, "When we define commerce to mean transportation, we wrote a role which have adhered to in every case since except in one or two cases where inadvertently, we overlooked it and those cases were subsequently overruled."</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.523" offset="8746005">Therefore, we start off with interstate commerce meaning interstate transportation and I submit to Your Honors that that meaning must carry over into the second paragraph, just as it must be applied to the first paragraph tined with the loss of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.027" offset="8840046">Now, in the second place, and I think this is equally important, the 1908 Act was not interpreted by this Court as applied only to employees in transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.455" offset="8917786">That is only to the cruise of trains, because in a series of decisions, the Court parted at 1939 had interpreted the Act as being broad enough to include in addition to the train cruise and those directly engaged in transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.867" offset="9011409">It said that those whose duties directly affected transportation were likewise within the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.690" offset="9058743">And finally in a series of cases it said, those whose duties so closely affected transportation as to be in legal contemplation and practical effect apart of that transportation that they also are brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.798" offset="9131154">So that by 1939, there were three groups of employees or three broad categories of employees who were concededly within the terms of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.818" offset="9195207">Now they were first the transportation employees themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.770" offset="9210984">The engine man, fireman, conductors, break man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.573" offset="9226240">Secondly, those whose duties directly affected transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.674" offset="9250691">And within that category were the yardman, certain station employees, a switchman, all the people who were on the ground but who by their duties cause transportation to move in one direction or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.292" offset="9333133">And then thirdly, there was a group who came within whose duties brought them closely in the contact with transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.339" offset="9385273">And they also were permitted to recover and within that category were those who maintain the right of way, those who repaired the instrumentalities of transportation, possibly others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.983" offset="9463850">Two great defenses that were brought forth again and again by the railroads blocked the congressional purpose in providing a strong remedy for those employees who faced the great hazards of the railroad industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.385" offset="9885466">Congress had to put in the language the question -- the broadened coverage which it was supplying when it abolished the moment of injury rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2543.897" offset="10175530">The clause dealing with furtherance, I submit, was clearly intended to take care of the employees who were actually in transportation and that it did not have any broad sweep such as has been suggested here today by other counsel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.934" offset="10291722">Furtherance was used in the sense of motion, the moving transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.024" offset="10316069">Your Honors must remember that we're referring here to furtherance of interstate or foreign commerce by the language but for commerce, you must substitute transportation since that was part of warp and woof of the reenactment of the first paragraph.</text>

            <text syncTime="2644.681" offset="10578651">I don't think you can -- you can start off and say that the first paragraph, although it's reenacted, now means something entirely different from what it meant under all our decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.577" offset="10934230">Then the directly clause or that the directly phrase was intended to abolish the moment of entry rule as it was applied to those who were not in transportation but whose duties had directly affected them, in other words, the -- the yardman and switchman and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.539" offset="11038093">And then they closely and substantially phrase again the predicate of the subject any part of whose duties again is simply a clause intended to abolish the moment of entry rule insofar as it was applied to repairman and maintenance man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.456" offset="11137776">Now, that construction of the amendment is fully borne out by the legislative history, and I -- I'd like to come immediately to -- to Justice Harlan's point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.560" offset="11210188">In the first place, I would like to, with Your Honors' indulgence, to read to you the two paragraphs on page 22 of my brief which was the entire report of the conferees after the -- the bill had been passed by both the House and the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.578" offset="11314260">The conferees agreed to a Senate provision not contained in the House amendment, which is intended to broaden the scope of the Employers' Liability Act so as to include within the provisions employees of common carriers who, while ordinarily engaged in the transportation of interstate commerce, maybe at the time of the injury temporarily divorce there from and engage in intrastate operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.456" offset="11413734">The question whether an employee at the time of this injury is engaged in interstate or intrastate commerce is frequently difficult of determination under the rule laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.189" offset="11464725">An employee of the railroad company who maybe injured must be found to have been engaged at the time of the infliction of the injury “in transportation or work so closely related to it as to be a practically a part of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.346" offset="11521358">Now, Senator Austin was the person who was responsible for limiting rather than broadening the language of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.257" offset="11592934">In addition to the -- the -- being responsible for putting in the so closely -- closely and substantially clause, he also was responsible for knocking out a clause or a phrase that was interpolated within the amendment as recently drawn which provided in any degree incidental to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.481" offset="11709858">And he said that he saw that was too broad and -- and have it knocked out and put in the closely and substantially instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.636" offset="11742459">Now, I think that it was perfectly clear that from all the background of the discussions, the fact that Mr. McGrath who was the proponent of this Act himself testified that this would only that the -- the amendment would only apply to the same employees to whom the Act had applied beforehand, i.e., and he listed with the trainmen and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.653" offset="11874534">And all the other discussion that -- that the -- the amendment was only to have a limited effect, I think when they came to putting in this language and referring to the words of this Court in its interpretation of the extent of the commerce power, commerce, I think that Senator Austin was simply out of an abundance of caution wanted to be sure that nothing that they put into this amendment might be interpreted by this Court as still too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.897" offset="12031582">And therefore, that he put in the closely and substantially and directly affecting knowing that this Court had recently said well, were something directly or closely and substantially affects commerce, why then Congress has the power to regulate it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.017" offset="13492036">But the employees who worked in an office building, the employees who were engaged in manufacture, the employees who were engaged in new construction, away from the tracks, away from the hazards of the railroad industry, those are people who should be left to the remedies of the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.503" offset="13573956">There's no reason to bring them within the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.190" offset="13592660">They went within the ambit of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.923" offset="13607602">They weren't contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.556" offset="13618155">First, originally because Congress saw they didn't have the power to bring them in perhaps but later on when it knew it had -- did have the power to bring them in, it didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.157" offset="13656607">Therefore, I submit that Ms. Reed and the plaintiffs in the other cases which Your Honor heard this morning ought to be relegated to the proper remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.687" offset="13698717">And that Your Honor should not enlarge the coverage of this Act which Your Honors have characterized as cruel as (Inaudible) and as unsatisfactory in many ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.746" offset="13754932">If the -- the coverage should not be expanded unless Congress itself expands this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.075" offset="13772278">It's much better for Congress to reexamine the whole thing and write a conversation on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.236" offset="13788891">There's a proper remedy for all the employees in the railroad industry.</text>
