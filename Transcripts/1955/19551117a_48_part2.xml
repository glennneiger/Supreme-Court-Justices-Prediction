          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="1.144" offset="4493">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.266" offset="13061">Because my time is running out, I can just touch lightly on some -- a few of the remaining subjects that we wanted to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.635" offset="66456">One of our points is that the Board's order must be set aside because of the Board's improper reliance on remote and discontinued practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.006" offset="107938">The Government agrees with us that the Board's findings and order under the Act had to be based upon relevant policies and practices of the petitioner subsequent to the date of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.243" offset="152869">But if you look at the Board's report, you'll find that the Board didn't base itself upon that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.838" offset="187350">The report ranges over the entire 33-year history of the petitioner mingling into one big stew, a few shreds of alleged contemporary happenings and a great bulk of remote matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.203" offset="244715">Most of the report deals with the 1920's and the 1930's which was the period before petitioner disaffiliated in 1940 from the Communist International, which as I said earlier, itself dissolved in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.044" offset="316082">The report shows that these practices, if they ever existed, were discontinued years ago, yet despite change in circumstances, despite the uncontradicted denials of petitioner's witnesses, the Board indulged in a presumption that these practices which had been discontinued, if they ever existed for at least 15 years, were still in effect and so did the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.980" offset="419840">Now, the only defense that the Government makes is to say that well, the Board really didn't indulge in the presumption but all you have to do is read the Board's report at the place cited by our brief, read the Court's decision and you will see that it did indulge in that presumption, that presumption itself was legal error requiring the setting aside of the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.223" offset="520882">On the question of sufficiency of the evidence, I want to call to your attention the fact that under this Act, the Board's findings must be supported by the preponderance of the evidence in place of the usual standard of substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.523" offset="578038">Much of what I've already said such as the Board's torturing of the standards, the 13 (e) and it's reliance on remote evidence already indicates how lacking in evidentiary support the Board's order is.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.694" offset="630700">But perhaps the most vivid illustration appears in the opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.346" offset="653375">There you'll find that the Court of Appeals said that it sustained the ultimate finding on the basis of six factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.920" offset="679602">This boiled down to the fact that the petitioner says it adheres the Marxist principles that its ultimate goal is a classless, stateless world that it calls itself the Communist Party and that it takes positions on foreign policy similar to those taken by the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.841" offset="751282">That's the basis on which the Court sustained the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.798" offset="763089">All these facts petitioner stated in its answer to the Attorney General's petition before the Board and petitioner has always proclaimed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.399" offset="797571">They do not and they cannot prove the petitioner is under Soviet control or operates to advance the terrible objectives described in Section 2 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.418" offset="845636">I can't dwell on, but I want to call the Court's attention to our motion for leave to adduce additional evidence made in the court below and denied by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.361" offset="881371">The Act authorizes the reviewing court to return the case to the Board to receive additional evidence on a showing that the evidence is material.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.939" offset="919719">We move to reopen for this purpose, showing that after the administrative proceeding was over, three of the Attorney General's principal witnesses, Harvey Matusow, Paul Crouch and Manning Johnson have so exposed themselves as perjurers that the Department of Justice had itself abandoned their youth, recognizing their other unreliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.708" offset="1006759">The denial of that motion compromises the administration and reputation of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.440" offset="1029747">I think if you will read the motion and the affidavit of the facts on which the motion is based, I think your consciences must and will be shocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.962" offset="1071752">I want to conclude and in summary by saying that the Act and its application here are an unprecedented invasion as Mr. Abt pointed out, a fundamental principle of the Constitution in our very democratic society.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.740" offset="1134864">This Act was enacted in the excitement of the Korean War.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.538" offset="1150119">In the name of anti-communism and the familiar but spurious cry of security, it would enforce conformity by suppressing peaceable advocacy and association using the odious technique of governmental defamation, not only of people but of writings and ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.754" offset="1222949">Inevitably, this police state objective generated police state procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.486" offset="1245936">The Act and the Board's order coerce self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.310" offset="1261192">They determine guilt by fire, paid labor writings, they establish arbitrary and irrational standards of proof, the Act creates a biased tribunal that has an interest in the event, it deprives individuals of their livelihood and liberty for innocent association and in this case the reckless use of unreliable witnesses has been condoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.556" offset="1354188">If these breaches of the Constitution can be upheld against the petitioner and its members, they can be and they will be used against other organizations and individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.451" offset="1393789">The Act has already moved on from the Communist Party, the so-called Communist fund organizations, the so-called Communist-infiltrated labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.240" offset="1428898">Having started to outlaw the Communist Party, it can go on with a techniques used by the Board here to destroy, say, the ADA or the NAACP or the fund for the republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.934" offset="1475709">We say and we think the record in this case bears this out that this position of this case will determine whether traditional liberties in this country already severely restricted will survive.</text>

          <heading>Argument of Simon E. Sobeloff</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="383.891" stopTime="387.933">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="383.891" offset="1535478">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="simon_sobeloff" startTime="387.933" stopTime="1198.258">
            <label>Mr. Simon E. Sobeloff</label>
            <text syncTime="387.933" offset="1551673">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.743" offset="1566929">The argument -- the arguments which you've just heard seek to cast the question in terms of a violation of a First Amendment but we do not see the case in that light, and we'd like to be understood at the outset to agree, nay, to insist that utterance, however it may diverge from popular opinion or from official opinion and no matter how close or odious, is permitted and protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.248" offset="1704960">And efforts to change people's minds and beliefs are immune from any interference under the protection of the First Amendment of the Constitution and a man is free to preach any doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.798" offset="1759190">But in -- in preaching doctrine, the couples there with conspiratorial plans to employ illegal means to subvert and destroy this Government, Congress may deal with it and the First Amendment does not stand in the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.436" offset="1829721">A mention was made here of the President's veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.287" offset="1849051">The President made some very serious criticisms about this bill which was passed over his veto as the Court knows, but he has this very significant sentence which is the only pertinent sentence to this case, the President said, "Insofar as the bill would require a registration of the Communist Party itself, it does not endanger our traditional liberties."</text>
            <text syncTime="487.719" offset="1950824">In a document that stresses the importance of these liberties, this distinction is clearly recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.316" offset="1985202">Now, what is the history and background of this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="500.020" offset="2000039">We can't consider the thing in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.102" offset="2012369">Let me review briefly what led to this enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.165" offset="2032640">What was the world situation in 1950 when Congress enacted this law?</text>
            <text syncTime="513.732" offset="2054896">For a generation or more, Congress as well as the rest of the world has been observing the activities of a world Communist movement that has its center in Moscow.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.352" offset="2101394">As early as 1931, almost a quarter of a century ago, William Z. Foster, the present president of this organization boldly told a committee of Congress that more advanced workers in this country look upon the Soviet Union as their country.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.148" offset="2188539">Congress -- that they held a whole series of coup de tat in Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.542" offset="2206093">They had seen successively this following up by the Soviet Union through military aggression of some of its neighbors like Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, parts of Poland and Finland and Congress had also witnessed as that of the whole world that this world Communist movement directed by the Soviet Union had by infiltration, by subversion, by fraud, deceit and the threat of force where force was not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.997" offset="2327928">They had taken Czechoslovakia and Hungary, Romania, Albania and for a time Yugoslavia and Bulgaria.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.162" offset="2364604">And Congress had not failed to note what a single quisling could accomplish in a strategic position and that since strong attempts made by the same methods to dominate Greece and Iran and Italy and France.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.713" offset="2426776">And in common with the rest of the world, Congress had noted with consternation the steady growth of this international movement and it's taking over in the most populous nation on the earth, China.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.563" offset="2478184">And they have noticed obvious preparatory moves to take over other parts of Asia.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.392" offset="2505561">Moreover, Congress had only three months before the passage of this law, who voted funds, to raise an army to send it to Korea to resist aggression of the same -- from the same source, neither Congress nor the President nor the nation thought that these events were of slight significance to our safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.145" offset="2620500">Moreover, there was a certain characteristic that was employed in this world Communist movement and it was emerging into clear view.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.022" offset="2672013">Evidence of espionage in England arranged through Klaus' books and in Canada through Gouzenko, who like books later confessed, that had become known and while Congress did that then know about Petrov's espionage in Australia or Maclean and Burgess in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.410" offset="2749544">The judgment that Congress expressed in 1950 have since then been confirmed by later revelations and Congress was not unaware what was going on at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.260" offset="2796983">In 1949, the year before the passage of this Act, there had been the conviction of the 10 leading officials of this Communist Party of the U.S.A., the very men who are leading this movement and that conviction had been affirmed only a month before the Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.320" offset="2913280">Now, as a result of these manifestations, Congress had become convinced as all the world had been convinced that there exists a Communist -- a world Communist movement and they have become convinced too of its eventual purpose that it was directed toward other nations and toward this nation in particular because it was regarded as the chief bourgeoise imperialist power.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.891" offset="3023517">So, summing it all up, I think it is an understatement to say that there was at least primary -- a prima facie evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.450" offset="3073776">Some would say it was overwhelming evidence that this world movement had a well-organized agent or agents in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.316" offset="3109198">Congress had also observed with mounting concern that there was not only this Dennis conviction but that the Party had from time to time in its propaganda and its activities faithfully reflected the Soviet Union's position, sometimes reversing itself with startling suddenness always acting, however, in consonance with the Soviet Union ships of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.960" offset="3235840">Now, Mr. Justice Jackson summarized it in a sentence, he said, "A chain of command from the Kremlin to the American Party is stoutly denied and usually invisible but is it was unmistakably disclosed by the American Communist Party somersaulting in synchronization with ships in the Kremlin foreign policy."</text>
            <text syncTime="830.835" offset="3323298">Now, I will not take time to recount the details of how when this Soviet Union zigged, they'd zigged along and when the Soviet Union zagged, they zagged too and when the Soviet Union took snuff, they would sneeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.869" offset="3391425">Now, the petitioner admits that there is a world Communist movement but it claims that it's a loose affiliation that its comprised of separate independent parties that there's no time, loyalty or discipline between it and the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.689" offset="3462687">It's only a fraternal or philosophic affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.852" offset="3479406">It's more like a chess club as you heard here this morning, a group of nature lovers, a sort of a glorified Boy Scout movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.831" offset="3511275">Now, that's not the conception that events require us to have of that Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.403" offset="3553593">Congress did not believe these professions of disaffiliation and there was ample evidence to support the view that that disaffiliation was not sincere, it's a spurious move.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.862" offset="3615347">The testimony in this case by one of the officers of the petitioner, Mrs. Flynn, was that it was friendly divorce in 1940, a friendly divorce, a sort of a divorce by mutual consent by proclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.430" offset="3689639">It was something to present to the world and Gouzenko said, "Announcement of the dissolution of the Comintern was, probably, the greatest farce of the Communist in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.119" offset="3740421">Only the name was liquidated, with the object of reassuring world opinion in the democratic countries."</text>
            <text syncTime="942.116" offset="3768424">Actually, the Comintern exists and continuous its work.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.436" offset="3785665">Now, all this was before the Commission, not only the Royal Commission in Canada but it was before the SACB, and SACB concluded that the evidence preponderates wasn't merely some supporting evidence, it preponderates to establish that the disaffiliation was for the expedient of avoiding registration as a foreign agent and that it did not alter the Party's relationship to the Communist International or the world Communist movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.229" offset="3904888">In other words, would -- business was going on as usual.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.770" offset="3918994">It was only a friendly divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.306" offset="3929130">Now, the record also shows that the Party changed its name in 1943, it became no longer the Communist Party, it was known as the Communist Political Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.018" offset="3988062">But in -- that was during the war when they wanted to create a semblance of unity with the American people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.408" offset="4013558">As soon as the war was over and Russia's interest seemed to diverge from that of this country, they again reconstituted themselves as the Communist Party of the U.S.A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.054" offset="4060160">This very tactic of name changing is that according to the documents of the Communist International thesis treated as an approved method of concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.058" offset="4104150">Now, Congress whatever else may be said about them, they don't have to be naïve as little red riding hood who wondered about grandma's big ears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.898" offset="4147513">They have a perfect right to view the facts and to make their appraisal and to draw their inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.259" offset="4176980">Now, with this body of knowledge and experience, Congress declared their -- the existence of a danger and the vitality -- the validity of these congressional findings that is the existence of the peril, I respectfully submit, must be accepted by this Court if there's any rational basis for Congress to believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.723" offset="4266841">I submit that it's almost difficult to imagine a rational basis for disbelieving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.211" offset="4300800">Now, coming now to the validity of the law itself, what are the issues that are here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.846" offset="4331311">It's important to know that before we start with the consideration of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.778" offset="4355030">The whole law is not properly an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.501" offset="4369972">There's no reason why this Court should go into every possible imaginary case that may or may not arise in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.659" offset="4398602">When Communist-front organizations are moved against and anyone fancies that its rights have been violated, this Court will be here to protect it -- to protect them, but it is not necessary and now when you're dealing with a Communist Party of the United States to imagine cases that have not yet arisen and that may never arise, we're dealing with this Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.942" offset="4499749">Now, there's no so-called front organization here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.124" offset="4512496">There's no record involving any individual here and these hypothetical cases do not call for determination now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.663" offset="4554606">So far as the Party is concerned there's only one command in this order, the command is registration and the consequences to the Party are simply that it must label its propaganda, there's no prohibition of their preaching, disseminating their doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.548" offset="4630152">They must label their publications and their broadcasts to identify the source and also deductions that people make to their -- I mean contributions that people make to them are not tax deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.859" offset="4707370">My contributions to the Republican Party are not tax deductible either and the many patriotic people who contribute to the Democratic Party suffer the same fate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.903" offset="4743523">So, I don't think it's a great depravation to the Communist Party to say, "We will no longer recognize them as a charitable institution entitled to special treatment."</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.712" offset="4778841">Congress has certainly the right to take that step.</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.277" offset="12421016">If there's anything that's been settled conclusively with regard to the claim of immunity under the Fifth Amendment, it is that it does not apply to an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.133" offset="12476500">It only can apply to an individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.663" offset="12578586">Now, if Mr. Dennis were to claim that he's entitled to immunity from answering that he is a member of the Party and that's what they say is really required of him when he is asked to register for the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.270" offset="12652983">Here is a man who has testified again and again or was said in public again and again that he is a member of the Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="3173.455" offset="12693734">This Court or no court would automatically grant him his immunity because as this Court recently pointed out with the (Inaudible) case, the judge before whom that claim is made has to appraise the genuineness of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.278" offset="12761025">If it is really asserted in order to prevent the incrimination if there's real danger, he is entitled to that immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.928" offset="12791641">If he's asserting it merely to -- as a cover-up for others, he's not entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.730" offset="12810867">If a man has really admitted it again and again and he's in no jeopardy by reason of this question, he would be denied that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5915.393" offset="23661505">Nevertheless, he says this is not a First Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5920.362" offset="23681358">He says nobody has a constitutional right to engage in a conspiracy to overthrow the Government, of course that's true and I put aside for the moment the question that there was no proof of such a conspiracy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.447" offset="23741753">Let's assume there was proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="5960.145" offset="23840496">Solicitor General says but none of their advocacy is legitimate or peaceful because it's all for a bad motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.998" offset="23867977">When they say we're against race discrimination, when they say we're for higher wages, when they say we're for peace, they are really doing this as part of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.072" offset="23916251">I submit, if the Court please, that one of the oldest devices of intolerance was -- is to say, "Yes, you're doing a good thing but we're punishing you because they do it for a bad purpose."</text>
            <text syncTime="5992.006" offset="23967974">As soon as the Government has the power to punish a legitimate activity because it labels that activity as being done for a bad purpose, you've armed a government with the power to suppress all legitimate activity.</text>
