            <label>Mr. Richard B. Montgomery</label>
            <text syncTime="9.002" offset="35944">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.970" offset="43781">The facts of this case are very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.628" offset="58410">The petitioner alleges that the failure of a light on Chandeleur Island in Louisiana on October 1st, 1951 was a cause of the grounding of a tug in Navajo.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.480" offset="117864">The petitioner specifically alleges the negligence of one Chief Petty Officer, Stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.048" offset="144091">This can best be set forth by the allegations of the petitions, which I will read to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.599" offset="170318">The failure of the said light was due to the negligence of Chief Petty Officer Stone and other officers and members of the Coast Guard in charge of aids to navigation, and to the officers of the Coast Guard Cutter Salvia, who failed to properly check their light which works on a sun relay system, that they failed to check the -- the battery and the sun relay system which causes the light to go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.191" offset="288705">And is alleged upon information and belief that there was a loose connection which could have been discovered upon proper inspection, that the said Coast Guard officers and other personnel of the Coast Guard on duty of this area had also failed to properly check the light, and to make any attempt to repair the same with due diligence or to notify marines using the light for navigation purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.923" offset="399673">The next allegation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.607" offset="410331">The said Chief Petty Officer Stone did not, when he checked the lighthouse on September the 7th, 1951, properly checked the connections which were out in the weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.029" offset="456098">No attempt was made to check the light to see whether it was operating properly between September the 7th and October the 1st, 1951, October the 1st being the date of the grounding.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.800" offset="507193">And that therefore, the said grounding was due solely to the negligence of the Coast Guard in the maintenance and servicing of said light, and in say you to properly maintain the light or to notify that vessels of the said light was not functioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.030" offset="568111">The Government filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the Court did not have jurisdiction under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.096" offset="608340">The Court of Appeals on a per curiam decision, affirmed the judgment of the lower court, facing its -- its opinions squarely on the majority opinion in the case of Dalehite versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.474" offset="673855">A writ of certiorari was granted, and as Your Honors know, this case was argued once before and is now on reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.324" offset="721293">It is our contention that this case comes squarely within the fair view of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.156" offset="760581">We alleged an individual act of negligence by a Coast Guard officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.354" offset="793391">We do not come under any of the exceptions to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.909" offset="819618">The exceptions to the Act as you know are any claim arising by reason of claimed negligence in a discretionary governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.027" offset="876042">Any claim arising out of laws and miscarriage of letters, any claim arising in respect to the assessment of collections of taxes, any claims which are provided for under the Suits in Admiralty Act or the Public Vessels Act, any claim arising out of an admission of any employees of the Government under the Alien Acts, any claim for damages caused by the position or establishment of a quarantine, any claims for injuries while vessels are passing through the locks of the Panama Canal Zone, and the -- any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, desist or interference with contract rights, any claim for damages caused by the physical operations of the Treasury or by the regulation of the monetary system, any claim arising out of the combatant activities of the Military or Naval Forces or the Coast Guard during time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.915" offset="1179585">Now, this is a Coast Guard which is specifically was a peacetime activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.955" offset="1199752">Any claim arising in a foreign country, and any claim arising from the activity of the Tennessee Valley Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.976" offset="1239876">Now, in the beginning of this case, the Government relied on the fact that this was not a discretionary act.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.258" offset="1272999">I do not believe that the Government still sticks to that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.113" offset="1292434">In the first place, the establishment of the light would have been a discretionary governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.081" offset="1324304">If the head of the Coast Guard had decided that that light was not essential to navigation and ordered that light put out, I would have no case and I would not be before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.536" offset="1386057">If they had decided to destroy that light, I would have had no case, but that was not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.016" offset="1416046">The Coast Guard thought that there was a necessity for that light to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.382" offset="1441437">And the light was -- it is alleged that the light was made up immediately put back into use.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.996" offset="1467977">It is clear, therefore, that we do not come under that part of the Dalehite majority opinion, which based this -- the dismissal of the Texas City claims upon a discretionary government function.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.896" offset="1547494">It is to be noted that continuously throughout that opinion, the majority of this honorable Court says that there was no individual act of negligence alleged as Honor Justice Reed said that's specifically and particularly in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.636" offset="1646446">Therefore, this case is clearly distinguishable from that case on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.113" offset="1680405">Furthermore, it seems to us that nowhere in the Act do we come under the very important exception, which is exception A in 1680 wherein it says, “No -- no official of the Government enforcing the law which -- whether the law be constitutional or not, or whether the discretionary function shall be guilty of such fault as to allow a suit against the United States Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="455.187" offset="1820735">It doesn't see -- it is impossible to say, “We submit, with all due respect, that this could be considered in any sense of discretionary function.”</text>
            <text syncTime="466.636" offset="1866501">This man's duty, this Coast Guard man's duty was to do one thing and one thing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.366" offset="1889384">He was out -- sent out there to check that light and see that it would work properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.116" offset="1912372">The Court has to accept the allegations that he did not do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.140" offset="1932539">The Court has to accept the allegations of negligence on a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.436" offset="1957721">We therefore say that we have made out a case in which there is the negligence of a member of the crew of a Coast Guard Cutter, an employee of the United States of America, acting in due course of his business that it is an act of -- of admission but the Act specifically provides for damages in case of an omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.592" offset="2066286">So, we say that insofar as the question of discretion is concerned, we definitely come under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.184" offset="2108709">The next question, which has been raised by the Government in defense of this, in -- in argument of it is that this is the ultimate end of a government function.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.211" offset="2168790">The -- the very learned counsel for the Government says that I will not come to grips with his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.506" offset="2202018">Well, I can find nowhere in the Act or anywhere else in the opinions, in the Feres opinion, or in the opinion of the Dalehite case where any such defense or words are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.633" offset="2282475">I have read and reread, and when of course when you use a negative, you can always possibly be proven to be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.349" offset="2313300">What I have read and reread, the Feres opinion and the Dalehite opinion, and I find no such saying that there wouldn't be liability in case the damage was caused by the ultimate function in which the negligence happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.058" offset="2392189">That is his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.192" offset="2396682">That although negligence of the Coast Guard Cutter in going out there would be actionable, because the ultimate function of the lighthouse service was to set out -- up a lighthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.118" offset="2460421">There's no negligence or negligence -- I'll rather put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.341" offset="2481319">That damage caused by the failure of that ultimate service caused by that negligence of an individual is not actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.582" offset="2518309">He has taken certain decisions of state courts wherein they talked about governmental functions and applied this to the Federal Tort Claims Act, although, there is nothing in the Act which emanate such.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.139" offset="2596467">If it had been the intention of Congress to make that an exception to the -- to the types of claims, which are actionable, they could've put it in their exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.490" offset="2649861">They could've said that where the function itself causes the -- the damage, they put in every other thing and to show that Congress did not mean that, that Congress thought that under the other provisions of the Act that there was a claims for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.820" offset="2727184">They specifically exempted damage to the mail, and if there ever is, the function -- an ultimate function is the delivery of the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.696" offset="2770756">But I always understood that the proper interpretation of a statute was if they wrote in exceptions and didn't -- and left out one thing, then that was an -- then that was considered as not being accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.481" offset="2837838">In this particular case, they could, as I say, they could have vary easily when they talked about the Coast Guard and accepted the failure of a light, but they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.786" offset="2883082">And the reason for use of the governmental functions, words or of the phrase comes up in many of the cases involved in municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.969" offset="2943791">Counsel tries to make these cases proved that the Federal Tort Claims Act excluded in a decision, which are not deciding for the decision, but for a very learned statement by Justice Gray of this Court, the case is Workman versus Mayor of New York, 179 U.S.552, which is not in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.659" offset="3066567">I only discovered this dissenting opinion recently since I've been in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.489" offset="3097913">In that case, a fire tug ran into a vessel on the way to the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.984" offset="3127902">Chief Justice White decided the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.379" offset="3141486">The question was.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.189" offset="3148696">Was there a real liability?</text>
            <text syncTime="790.284" offset="3161130">Chief -- although the State of New York held that fire -- that -- that damages arising from fire were not actionable, he held that they were under the General Maritime Law, so the case has no -- has no bearing as I see it on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.000" offset="3231974">When both Chief Justice --</text>

            <text syncTime="809.014" offset="3236049">It has -- it has a bearing on the sense of conviction of the Government that there is a great (Inaudible) conviction question, fundamental of execution of question, in some aspect and in some other aspect.</text>

            <text syncTime="872.065" offset="3488183">That's absolutely correct, sir, 179 U.S.552, decided by Chief Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.368" offset="3533427">He said that the law of New York did not govern in that case, because he could not, more than Maritime Law, which has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.041" offset="3568118">But he went on to say in that case that the -- the distinction between cases where the municipalities could be liable for failure to maintain bridges, and failure to proper repair streets, and fire had and -- and the Fire Department's work was that the Fire Department's work was really a function of the State Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.181" offset="3684624">Now, although it was delegated to the municipality, it was a function of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.205" offset="3708761">And since the State had not authorized suit against it, you could not sue a municipality for something, which inherently belonged to all the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.992" offset="3755886">But he said, “That was what was known as a governmental function for that reason, but did as to everything else in municipality did as for instance in repairing streets, maintaining bridges that that they could be sued for, because although it was a function of the municipality, it was a municipal function.”</text>
            <text syncTime="961.262" offset="3845016">And that is -- and last time I argued this case, as Honor Judge Frankfurter asked me how I could distinguish the various cases of the States, involving stoplights.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.573" offset="3902276">Well, I now think that the distinction is this, there are many States that now hold that stop lights or the failure to operate a stop light properly comes -- is actionable against the municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.955" offset="3955775">The ones who -- who do not fail to distinguish that the operation of the stoplights are not part of the police work of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.469" offset="3997780">The Police Department falls in the same category as Justice Gray says about the Fire Department, and the New York and Illinois make that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.583" offset="4046263">They -- and in the New York case particularly, the -- the stoplights are not operated in the State by the Police Department, but by an authority which is given the -- given the duty of operating those stoplights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.521" offset="4114077">Now, going back to this case, the Coast Guard was not operating in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.950" offset="4139781">The operation of that light was not operating as part of its duty of being an active combatant unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.930" offset="4179696">It was operating it solely as a governmental agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.179" offset="4212715">And therefore, the fact that the light went out does not -- and did the damage instead of the officer individually doing the damage, does not come under any restriction or exemptions under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.373" offset="12253414">You'll find that those cases will apply that phrase to a situation where you have a governmental activity even though no act of judgment is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.898" offset="12299494">For example, you may have a case of negligent fire fighting where the fireman on the scene was negligent.</text>

            <text syncTime="5034.780" offset="20139050">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.696" offset="20150753">It seems to me that counsel was trying to make a distinction by saying that there was no obligation on the part of the Government to maintain that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.121" offset="20192444">Well, it sort of shocks me because once the Government creates the light, an aid to navigation, they're certainly on obligation not to let that light go out with mariners, warning being warned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.915" offset="20247615">As a matter of fact, the Government always report discontinues in aid to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.231" offset="20268826">It sends out notices to mariners that the aid is going to be discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="5072.281" offset="20289097">And if someone went out on the road and -- and started in to set up signs to prevent accidents for some reason, the dangerous situation exists deeply on obligation to do it correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.954" offset="20347716">Now, there isn't any doubt but the Government's argument comes to the fact that whenever the Government takes over a function and makes it uniquely theirs, then there's no right under the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.832" offset="20403304">Aids to navigation -- will not -- are not considered until the Government took it over to a very unique government function.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.080" offset="20436219">And if you have a private canal, as I've said, you can set up or suppose to set up the light if your vessel is using it and the Government grants permission in cases of private canals being used by one company to set up whatever aids they need.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.070" offset="20504242">And if a seaman, as I said, was injured on a vessel, which because the Government -- because the private place can set up an improper aids to navigation, their safety would be a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.566" offset="20546247">As I understood what the sentence meant, it meant that there had to be a common law remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.460" offset="20573832">That it couldn't be something that -- there's never been a common law right created for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.778" offset="20595043">They're bound to become law rights where improper aid to anybody is -- is used as in this case.</text>
