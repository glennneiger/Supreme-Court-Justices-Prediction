            <label>Mr. Marvin E. Frankel</label>
            <text syncTime="5.107" offset="20376">If the Court please, I had turned to the question on which the Third Circuit decided this case against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.144" offset="52558">The holding that when the -- when Section 235 (a) gave power to subpoena witnesses, it did not include power to subpoena a party who is under investigation and who might be a party to some subsequent judicial or administrative adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.697" offset="142733">At page 41 of our brief in the footnote, we've collected a list, by no means, complete, of federal statutory provisions granting administrative subpoena power.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.145" offset="200516">In all of this and in others, the statute provides power to subpoena witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.364" offset="233430">And that word, “witnesses” in this context, whatever else it includes or excludes has always been understood to include, perhaps above all a person or a corporation, which was himself or itself under investigation, the person who in the language of the Morton Salt case is in the best position to give information and may be least willing to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.977" offset="355892">In this context, unlike the context of the discovery statutes the court below referred to, we think the word “witnesses” is perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.013" offset="399987">Whoever it includes, it certainly includes a party who is himself being investigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.595" offset="430289">In fact, the decision below, in a way, gives a reverse twist to the problem as it has usually be -- been presented in this administrative subpoena cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.993" offset="479922">As the Court knows, in cases like Oklahoma Press Publishing Company against Walling and others, the question is frequently been raised by a party subpoenaed whether he could be subpoenaed.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.143" offset="536555">And the argument has frequently been made that he was not covered by the Act, not within the area of the administrative agencies concerned that there was no probable cause, no coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.069" offset="592248">Those cases have all assumed at the very least that if the person wants himself a proper subject of investigation, then he certainly could be subpoenaed and there is no need here, of course, to go into the extent of the inquiry into coverage just as it's been presented in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.906" offset="671556">I mentioned them only because they show vividly what we think is the clear error of the court below in its construction of the word “witnesses” in this kind of context.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.208" offset="2328764">And in great many of these provisions we cite, relating to administrative, investigative subpoena power which is what concerns us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.707" offset="2370769">The Acts to which they relay, contained provisions for proceedings of one kind to another in Court, civil or criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.555" offset="2410162">Now, it's always been clear that there was no inconsistency between those provisions for court proceedings and the authority to use an administrative subpoena for investigative purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.699" offset="2466795">The investigative subpoena is used and to bring it to this context, it's used to determine whether there is the good cause that or to exist before a -- an action is brought to denaturalize the person, whether it -- whether the good cause exist in terms of the affidavit or in terms of knowledge of the U.S. Attorney in this problem and another case pending that -- that I won't go into.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.595" offset="2586331">But the agency in every case, whether it's under the Federal Trade Commission or whether it's the SCC that's simply determining whether somebody has solved securities fraudulently or whether it's the veterans administrator determining whether a school under the GI Bill has committed a fraud or an alleged veteran has fraudulently obtained rights or claims.In every one of these cases, the agency may be and frequently is seeking to determine whether it ought to go to Court to prosecute this person, either civilly or criminally.</text>

            <text syncTime="699.844" offset="2799282">You have -- and -- and many decisions, I might say, make this distinction between the power of administrative investigation which this Court has from time to time compared to a grand jury's proceedings or a pretrial discovery between that on the one hand, and the judicial proceedings on the other hand that the investigating agency may be authorized or under a duty to bring inappropriate circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.769" offset="2922998">So, we think the court below was wrong when it said that there was a conflict or an inconsistency between the creation on the one hand of a judicial proceeding for revocation of fraudulent certificates of naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.159" offset="2988617">And our claim on the other hand that the Immigration Service could use the subpoena power in its investigation to determine whether such a case ought to be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.333" offset="3029264">That -- that is a familiar pattern of administrative investigation followed by appropriate judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.580" offset="3070224">And as -- as I say, the statutes, which have conferred the subpoena power, refer repeatedly in all of these instances cited in our brief and in others simply to witnesses, and that in every case includes at least the person who is under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.209" offset="3160816">Now, this does not mean that either at the administrative stage or at the judicial stage, any of the protections of a person are denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.312" offset="3201149">The Fifth Circuit, which like the Second Circuit, has agreed with us on this problem, has had occasion recently to uphold, for example, a claim of privilege by a person subpoenaed in an investigation of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.075" offset="3260291">And where a claim of privilege is appropriate, we assume that it will be asserted and vindicated in the Courts which are the only agencies that have any power of compulsion of -- in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.141" offset="3328522">So, in short, agreeing with the court below and the other two circuits that investigations of this type are covered by 235 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="843.011" offset="3371990">What we assert in this case is that the narrow basis of decision of the court below is incorrect and that the naturalized citizen whose certificate is being inquired into may be subpoenaed in such an investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2428.976" offset="9715879">For instance, a typical example of the subpoena provision of the Federal Trade Commission would state, relating to any matter under investigation, or the Security Exchange Commission, that reads, “The Commission made in this -- in this discretion, make such investigations as a deemed necessary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.605" offset="9790380">Then, skipping down, “Any member of the Commission is empowered to administer oust subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.679" offset="9822668">But what do we have here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.161" offset="9832594">Section 235 (a) of the Immigration Act isn't in this broad general form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.464" offset="9853806">It reads as follows, “The first part of the subject, sentence of Section 235 (a) contains specifications, and therefore, limitation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.816" offset="9895184">Here is the way it goes, “The Attorney General and then the immigration officer shall have the power to require by a subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses before immigration officers and special inquiry officers relating to the privilege of any person to enter, reenter, reside in, or pass through the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.917" offset="9987657">And then, and only then, follows this phrase, “or concerning any matter which is material and relevant for the enforcement of this Act in administration of the Service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.429" offset="10021616">Now, if this sentence was that the Government argues, the general subpoena power analogous to the subpoena power that we find in the SCC, Federal Trade Commission or through every agency subpoena provision, especially the ones mentioned on page 41, all the Government had to do is to read and they would see it's entirely different than this subpoena provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.530" offset="10126106">They -- they don't have the specification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.988" offset="10135928">Now, here's what the Government does on page 11 of its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.838" offset="10155259">They say, the plain language supports its theory and quotes, “the subpoena provision.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.748" offset="10178978">That is there version of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2567.079" offset="10268212">Now, if that is the way Congress had written that subpoena provision, then I couldn't argue that this subpoena provision wasn't a general provision, and then I have to argue the constitutional phase of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.704" offset="10326727">But here, the Government is simply not playing all the notes as they were written, and only by skipping and leaving gap, half of the sentence they arrived at the subpoena provision which in form is analogous to the subpoena provisions found in the other administrative agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2611.376" offset="10445427">The -- the best answer to that is what the Service themselves have stated when they asked for that provision before Congress, and that's almost a rather cynical position for the immigration officer for the Immigration Service to try to say that this business of matter includes denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.490" offset="10541871">Here is what took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.629" offset="10550439">In the various documents prepared by the Service for the Congress before the passage of the Act, that here is what they specifically stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.437" offset="10589727">It's on page 18 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.420" offset="10601639">In the document entitled, "Original of Analysis", and I'm reading from the Government's brief on page 18, listen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.423" offset="10637688">As a matter of fact, I would've known that if the Government had imprinted it, they read -- they'd put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.777" offset="10659004">“The second objective which the Service would like to see accomplished in connection with this subsection, 235 (a), is to provide specific authority to administer rousing the question not only aliens who seek to enter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.394" offset="10709473">The emphasis is on the word “enter” there, the United States, “but also, nationals of the United States and the compelled testimony by subpoena in such cases.” In this case, the respondent Minker has been a resident of Pennsylvania for the past 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.093" offset="10768300">It is believed, that it is the intent of this section to accomplish that purpose, but the Service believes that certain amendments of language are necessary in order that they may be no doubt concerning the authority of service officers in these respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.088" offset="10832248">We also wish to see the power to administer oaths, and to take and consider evidence extended to any matter, which is material and relevant to the administration of this Act in the Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.789" offset="10879060">We have in mind in that regard, the fact that under administrator regulation contained in 8 C.F.R. Part 95, there are provisions for disciplinary action against the attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.488" offset="11093891">The Service is that this additional phrase be put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.642" offset="11106534">It wasn't referred in the Act, in the prior Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.783" offset="11151047">And then other piece of -- on page 20, the additional draft, they asked -- they put it this way, “In addition, this subsection contains a provision permitting inquirer under oath and by subpoena concerning any matter relevant to the enforcement of this Act in the administration of the Service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.028" offset="11228056">These provisions will be of great value in connection with such matters as for example, investigation of applications for admission to practice as attorneys or representative before the Service and Board of Immigration Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.342" offset="11273300">Now, they never said at that particular time that if -- that is if I can conceive -- if your question was, what is the meaning of that particular phrase?</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.175" offset="11344666">I understand you to say that as far as scope of this power is concerned, it's limited to immigration as distinguished from naturalization for statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.873" offset="11387402">And I'm asking you, if that be so, what is it that would be -- would make necessary that broader provision in the Act, whether as the Government reached it.If -- it is in the immigration only because immigration has sufficiently covered, it is not, and what is specifically referred to in the preceding section, in the preceding sentence?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jacob Kossman</label>
            <text syncTime="2870.415" offset="11481652">Well, if they had written the phrase, this investigating phrase, the same as it's written in all the other agencies, one little broad sentence that simply says, “Any matter under investigation,” that would be enough to incumbent as the word denaturalization proceedings as well as the immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.192" offset="11564722">But where they have specified reenter, privilege of a person to enter, reenter, or any other matter, it seems that by specifying certain details, the principle of ejusdem generis and then following with or any other matter that they cannot say, “or if any other matter is greater in scope than what precedes,' plus, their own -- their own reason for putting that phrase in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.877" offset="11683422">That is my -- I believe my answer to the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2928.222" offset="11712888">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.299" offset="11721143">Now, unfortunately, the various Courts of Appeals, in construing this section, didn't have access to these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.030" offset="11756042">A very vexing problem as Mr. Justice Jackson has printed out in the concurring opinion of United States versus the Public Utility Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.647" offset="11786553">Certainly, it might well advance if the query of the Second Circuit which felt the words, “Concerning any matter which is essential or relevant to the enforcement of this Act and the administration of the Service would have no meaning.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.276" offset="11833051">In other words, they felt that they have to have some meaning, and since that phrase by itself is analogous to the other agency provisions, so they decided on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.137" offset="11884460">As Judge Medina quoted, “There are these significant words to be left hanging in the air as it were, and given no effect whatever,” I submit that there's a possibility that if he had known about what Congress themselves, what had been told by the Services, but there's even more than that because the -- the legislative history itself, the legislative history itself shows that it might be revealed by the Senate and House reports, it's all in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.734" offset="12014864">This -- it was specifically disclosed that Congress did not intend by this provision to sanction the indiscriminate questioning or harassment of citizens returning to the United States, but it was only to be used by immigration officers when the person was coming into the United States, and was suspected that they haven't been expatriated which of course would be automatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.058" offset="12100232">That was the reason why they changed the word, "persons", they called it a "privilege of persons" lifting it bubbly from -- from the (Inaudible) case, which talked about the privilege of -- of aliens, and made it much broader which they had a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.113" offset="12188421">The Government doesn't argue because as the word, “persons” has been used instead of aliens that have encompass the citizens, there are people who claimed as the result of the last wars that they are citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.475" offset="12233874">So, this is perfectly proper for Congress to say, “Privilege of any person coming in, because if a man says he's a citizen and they are stealth, they can investigate, they can subpoena.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.044" offset="12276088">But here, there is no doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.085" offset="12288313">As a matter of fact, I don't, I want to relieve the Government of at least one burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.578" offset="12314227">In fact, the only burden still we have noticed, a registered letter was sent by the Immigration and Naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.431" offset="12337633">It's on page 4 of the record, which it says, “You are advised, your attendance is commanded in accordance with above referred to subpoena, in order that you may give testimony in connection with and relating to the possible institution of proceedings seeking the revocation of your naturalization, in accordance with Section 340,” an administrative hearing, in order to find that they have enough evidence to possibly seek his revocation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.044" offset="12860082">Now, the subpoena power is usually found another administrative agency in a separate section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.735" offset="12882860">You have it under evidence or investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.701" offset="12894772">Here, we have jammed in a section that deals specifically with inspection of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.036" offset="12916088">Now, in the very same section, there's an exact provision, words for word, as -- as the subpoena sentence except that the subpoena is not granted and the word, "persons" is used instead of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.416" offset="12977633">Now, that's very important because it shows that Congress was aware of the distinction between subpoena and witnesses, and subpoena and persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.643" offset="13010547">Here's the way it's written, just two sentences above in the same Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.916" offset="13027579">The Attorney General and the immigration officer shall have power to administer oaths and for taking considered evidence of or from any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.476" offset="13061851">They don't use -- they use the word witness in the subpoena provision to sentences later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.410" offset="13077629">From any or from any person touching the privilege of any alien or person he believes or suspects to be an alien, to enter, reenter, pass through or reside in United States, or concerning any matter which is material and relevant to the enforcement of this Act and the administration of the Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.945" offset="13135726">In other words, you have exactly the same provision for gathering all the evidence they want to, minus the subpoena provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.118" offset="13160385">When they give you the subpoena provision, they leave -- they changed the word “persons” to “witnesses”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.941" offset="13179716">Now, certainly, the normal course, the normal meaning of a word “witnesses”, is to be a witness against someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.030" offset="13204062">This Court has in cases decided in view of the nature of denaturalization and deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.467" offset="13233842">The word, “entry” doesn't even have a common ordinary meaning of the word “entry".</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.456" offset="13249724">Now, as this Court therefore rather decided that the word “witness” doesn't mean witness, but means witnessed something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.044" offset="13280131">Now, there is more -- there is more internal evidence which shows that the Third Circuit was -- was correct in their interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.167" offset="13328614">In all the other agencies, every one of them, there is a subpoena provision, but there's only one subpoena provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.328" offset="13361215">Here, what do we find?</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.053" offset="13368111">We also find that despite the contention of the Government of a general power existed in Section 235 (a), that Congress found if necessary to specifically grant the subpoena power in 335 (b), in the same act in regard to pre-naturalization examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.099" offset="13436343">Now, we don't find separate grants of powers in other administrative agencies, it's only given once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.357" offset="13461420">Once is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.655" offset="13466540">Now, therefore, we have a right to contend that if the subpoena power under Section 235 (a) as applied to all matters connected with enforcement of the Act, it would have been be necessary to repeat it in 335 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.785" offset="13523069">Now, the Government very cleverly tries to distinguish the -- why two different subpoenas have been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.803" offset="13555148">They said, “Oh, one is investigating, and the other is judicial, quasi-judicial, a hearing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.952" offset="13583778">But no other administrative agency has two different subpoena provisions even though those two different functions exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="3813.407" offset="15253525">In the recent case in the Seventh Circuit, United States versus Vivian, an individual subpoena to testify against someone who had to be deported, and under 235 (b), and the Seventh Circuit, mindful of the Minker case, which was not cited by the Government, and mindful of the Barnes case which uphold the Government's contention which was cited by the Government, therefore, less stated, “We don't have to await the decision of this Court on those two because -- on those two cases because the witness is not a party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.610" offset="15406393">So, they've decided and we -- we submit there's nothing here to prevent subpoenaing witnesses in order to testify against aliens and -- and people to be deported and what not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.663" offset="15462609">And the Seventh Circuit takes cognizance of that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.600" offset="15482358">Oh, yes, I just found that little note.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.313" offset="15493224">In 1918, denaturalization laws were amended to allow the Commissioner of naturalization to enter suit on behalf of the United States, under Section 15, but this was deleted in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.516" offset="15554038">So, I think that's a little bit of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.893" offset="15563546">In other words, we have everything which shows that Congress did not -- did not wish to give power to the administrative agency to subpoena citizens internally and externally.</text>

            <text syncTime="3907.501" offset="15630002">Yes, but in the old Section, the Commissioner had the power to institute suit of immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.700" offset="15654766">That has been removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.858" offset="15659363">It's only the District Attorney who can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.359" offset="15669394">Well, I thought it might show that Congress has eliminated something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.440" offset="15693740">Certainly, the Government might well have argued that the Commissioner had the power to institute suit as many federal -- many federal agents, they have a right to Federal Trade Commission, SCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.404" offset="15733551">Now, there's just another thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.101" offset="15748389">We had the doctrine of the actual construction of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.512" offset="15766047">Our -- our philosophy is that in this type of case that we see what the spirit is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.128" offset="15792483">I mean, we know that the letter of the law kill us but the spirit give us life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.778" offset="15811082">And in this kind of a preceding, it's appropriate for this Court to avoid the harshness that would come about as a result of delivering millions of naturalized citizens into the hands of investigate -- immigration inspectors who don't need good cause in order to wish she was subpoenaed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.646" offset="15886524">That's a tremendous power to give an administrative officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.849" offset="15899376">And how has it worked out?</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.284" offset="15905123">The Government's brief shows in 1500 investigations where they brought in individuals that they've only, I think 20 or 30 revocations have resolved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.195" offset="15960712">Now, certainly, that's too great power.</text>

            <text syncTime="4040.305" offset="16161123">Now, in our sociological times, I mean the touchstone of interpretation of statutes is not based on the fact as to whether subversives or bad people may lose their particular citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.555" offset="16214204">We submit that when a citizen is confronted with an administrative challenge to his right to retain his citizenship that he is not to be regarded as a witness within the meaning of Section 235 (a), and that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.462" offset="16281809">The constitutional arguments that I have in my brief only come into play if this Court feels that power was given in 235 (a), to subpoena naturalized citizens.</text>
