            <label>Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky</label>
            <text syncTime="20.345" offset="81293">If the Court please, this is the companion case to the Southwest Exploration Company argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.996" offset="119954">The taxpayer in this case is one of the upland owners, Huntington Beach Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.931" offset="143673">And the Court of Claims held that it was entitled to depletion on the income payments which Southwest Company had made to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.274" offset="192993">Just to clarify what the situation is with respect to the division of the allowance the year here involved was 1948 and in that year the gross income, which Southwest had obtained from the leases, was approximately $20,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.198" offset="268748">After deducting it, its expenses, it had a net income of some $7,300,000 of which it had paid to Huntington Beach, $1,300,000, maybe it share of the net profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.205" offset="328725">Now, if the Ninth Circuit were correct in the Southwest case, Southwest would be entitled to a deduction based on the entire $20,000,000 of income it obtained from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.394" offset="381492">So that its actual depletion deduction would be about $5,500,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.240" offset="408869">Now, if the Court of Claims is correct, then out of the Southwest $20,000,000, it must exclude the $1,300,000 it paid to the upland owner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.864" offset="463412">So that its depletion base would be $18,700,000 instead of $20,000,000 and the depletion base of Huntington Beach would be $1,300,000, the net profit payments which it received.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.121" offset="532480">The Court of Claims in holding that Huntington Beach had a depletable interest followed what is our first alternative argument, namely, that under the peculiar circumstances of this case, the upland owners had contributed valuable rights which enabled production to take place and that they have received a depletable interest in the form of net profit payments which became within the rationality of Burton-Sutton and Kirby.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.849" offset="671347">That I -- the Court of Claims gave a practical example, which I think is very persuasive, it posed this hypothetical situation that imagine that the owner of land had given an easement for a golf course permitting it to use the surface of the land, so that the golf club had complete rights with respect to that surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.232" offset="772911">And that thereafter, minerals were discovered to underlie the surface and the owner of the property had given a mineral deed to a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.940" offset="815752">But that third party cannot exploit the minerals without digging through the surface of the land and so he must turn to the golf club to obtain the necessary property rights to permit that to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.998" offset="871967">So, the Court of Claims says, suppose that the owner of the mineral rights now deals with the owner of the surface or the person who has an easement with the surface and obtains the right to break through the surface and will pay for the life of mineral lease a portion of the net profits from production.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.892" offset="955559">Court of Claims assumed that that would be an easy case that the owner of the surface ought to have the deduction for depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.600" offset="982309">“And,” said the Court of Claims and we agree with the Court of Claims, “This case should be no different that the upland owners do not have their property immediately and physically above the mineral deposits and that the physical mineral deposit lies at an angle.”</text>
            <text syncTime="264.092" offset="1056287">The important thing is that their property is being used and their property is enabling the production to take place.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hilbert_p_zarky" startTime="282.938" stopTime="608.248">
            <label>Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky</label>
            <text syncTime="282.938" offset="1131729">I was just going to that, Mr. Justice Burton.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.165" offset="1140611">As a background, I must talk about three cases, which have preceded Kirby and Burton-Sutton, and which the Court of Claims and we distinguished on the particular facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.789" offset="1203096">That was a trilogy of cases all reported in the 303 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.222" offset="1220859">One case is Helvering v. O'Donnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.258" offset="1232980">The taxpayer in that case own one-third of the stock in a corporation that had oil and gas leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.547" offset="1262132">He sold his stock to another corporation which undertook to acquire the oil properties from the first corporation and as consideration for the stock which it acquired was going to pay Mr. O'Donnell one-third of the net profits from its production after it acquired the oil properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.253" offset="1344993">This Court held that the net profit payments received by the selling stockholder were not depletable.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.749" offset="1386893">The next case is Elbe Oil Land.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.848" offset="1403298">There, the owner of oil-bearing property had transferred it for a large dated consideration, partly payable immediately and partly payable in installments in the future if the transferee elected not to abandon the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.562" offset="1478217">In addition, the transferee undertook to pay to the transferor a percentage of its net profits after it had recouped its entire investment including this purchase price which it had paid for the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.708" offset="1534746">And the issue in that case was whether the installment payments were themselves subject to depletion or whether they were sales profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.527" offset="1570064">There having been no net profits paid in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.489" offset="1585946">And the third case is Helvering v. Bankline Oil Company where the taxpayer had a contract with a lessee of the wells to buy the gas as it float in the wells and to process it making natural gas and gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.403" offset="1665567">And in Bankline, the taxpayer claimed that it was buying under its contract, the gas at a favorable price less than market price and then it should be entitled to depletion on the difference between the price that paid under the contract and the price which it would have paid and had it been buying at market price.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.202" offset="1744771">Now, we distinguish those three cases on the ground that, and none of them as here, was the party receiving the net profit payments, doing anything essential to the production of oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.768" offset="1795030">When the stockholders sold his stock in O'Donnell, he wasn't like the upland owners here enabling the lessee to get to the property, except in a more -- most indirect sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.495" offset="1841946">Elbe itself is peculiar because you were trying to test whether there was a sale measured by the fact that the net profit payments had been retained and this Court said that interest was not one which qualify the sale in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.430" offset="1897639">And indeed in Burton-Sutton, the Court indicated that Elbe should not be extended beyond its facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.931" offset="1923657">And Bankline represented nearly a favorable contract to purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.021" offset="1948003">Now, to get more to the answer to your question, Mr. Justice Burton, for those trilogy of cases, the Treasury amended its regulations immediately thereafter to provide that a favorable contract and interest in net profits is not a depletable interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.380" offset="2025430">And the Government so thought that's what the three cases stood for.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.021" offset="2040059">And that's why when Kirby and Burton-Sutton was here, the Government relying on those regulations contented very rigorously that nothing short of an interest in gross production could be depletable and that an interest in net production or net profits could not be depletable.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.308" offset="2113202">This Court, of course, held to the contrary in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.184" offset="2128666">So that this Court in effect did not feel that the regulations was a correct interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.289" offset="2169104">In other words, to the extent that the regulations say that an interest in net profits is not a depletable or economic interest in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.349" offset="2205362">The regulations are in contradiction to what Kirby and Burton-Sutton held.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.045" offset="2228140">And my understanding is that under the new Code, the proposed Treasury Regulations contemplate omitting that particular sentence in order to have the regulations conform to the Kirby and Burton-Sutton cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.383" offset="2285505">So that actually to the extent that the argument rests here on the regulations is the very same argument which the Government twice advanced unsuccessfully in this very tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.188" offset="2328660">So that we do not feel that the regulations at all point to the fact that the upland owners cannot have a depletable interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.137" offset="2384457">I think it might be helpful if I ran down some of the arguments, which the Ninth Circuit accepted, to indicate why we think they are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.316" offset="2425208">To a large extent, the --</text>

            <label>Justice Stanley Reed</label>
            <text syncTime="608.248" offset="2432940">But before -- before you leave the regulation, isn't -- isn't there a difference between the interest in the -- in the Burton-Sutton and the -- the -- what's the other case, Kirby?</text>

          <turn speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="622.707" stopTime="628.205">
            <label>Justice Stanley Reed</label>
            <text syncTime="622.707" offset="2490828">-- different interests of what we have here?</text>

            <label>Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky</label>
            <text syncTime="628.205" offset="2512771">I think not in Burton-Sutton, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.221" offset="2520816">I say this for this reason, prior to the transfer in Kirby and Burton-Sutton, there was a difference because the transferor stood in a position where they could exploit the minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.752" offset="2567001">But after the transfer in Burton-Sutton, Gulf, the assignor, had no further interest, any further legal interest, in the minerals in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.068" offset="2612245">So far as Gulf was concerned, it was as much a stranger to what was taking place after the less -- after the assignment than the upland owners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.732" offset="2662922">But Gulf did have an interest and that's what this Court held was important.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.409" offset="2681626">It maintained an interest by having reserved the share of the net profits of the operator and it was that economic interest which this Court said having them retained by Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.603" offset="2722377">It meant that Gulf must look to the depletion allowance to recover whatever capital investment it had in the minerals in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.591" offset="2754351">So we feel that this case stands just like Burton-Sutton.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.931" offset="2771696">There have been arguments made which indicate that authorities, that Burton-Sutton is different because, for example, there was a covenant there to reconvey to the assignor if the assignee didn't develop the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.264" offset="2824986">There have been arguments in here that this is not a rent or royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.563" offset="2842227">This is a personal covenant of Southwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.227" offset="2856856">But the Fifth Circuit, you will recall, decided Burton-Sutton in the Government's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.820" offset="2875246">It had held that -- and that profit payments were not depletable and the Fifth Circuit did so on the very philosophy that that was a personal covenant that the assignor had no interest in the minerals and this had followed the previous decisions of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.107" offset="2936372">So that so far as the legal interest is concerned, it seems to us that the upland owners here stand in the same -- almost the same situation if the assignor did in Burton-Sutton after the assignment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1057.470" offset="4229851">Well, the Bureau -- the Internal Revenue Service is now preparing regulations under the new 1954 Code which didn't change the basic statute from the 39 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.475" offset="4269871">And it's a long time consuming process to get out all the details.</text>

            <text syncTime="1081.326" offset="4325251">I would like, if I may, to pass to our alternative argument, which is that without regard to whether or how the upland owners acquired this interest in net profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.045" offset="4372167">We ask the Court to hold that it had an economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.445" offset="4389721">Now, we recognized, we're asking the Court to go beyond what was decided in Kirby and Burton-Sutton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.835" offset="4415321">Now, we think we're asking for a sensible logical extension of those cases to make a workable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.277" offset="4457012">An interest in gross production is obtained by the life of the lease like a gross royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.680" offset="4482717">That's depletable no matter who has it or how he obtained it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.528" offset="4502047">And its common in the industry for the lessor to fragment his reserved royalty and sell it to others and its common for the lessee to fragment his interest by granting overriding royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.828" offset="4571220">And as a matter of fact, by -- in many situation, you will find hundreds of people having minute fraction of the right to -- every barrel of oil produced or the proceeds from their sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.756" offset="4627017">And no one doubts that those interests are depletable so long as they're (Inaudible) with the lease no matter how they go, whether by sale, assignment, by inheritance just so long as the party who has the interest has an interest in gross production that is depletable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.480" offset="4709878">Now, the question we pose is, if as Kirby and Burton-Sutton hold an interest in net profits is so like an interest in gross production as to be depletable in the circumstances of those cases, should not the same rule apply to an interest in net profits no matter how its conveyed or to whom its conveyed or how its obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.215" offset="4804859">That is if the lessor or assignor and Kirby and Burton-Sutton having retained an interest in net profits is entitled to depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.239" offset="4844878">Shouldn't a transferee for cash consideration, donation by gift, by inheritance, shouldn't the transferee stand in the same position that the transferor did?</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.494" offset="4901930">And if that interest can be carved out by the lessor, why shouldn't the lessee be able to carve it out, just as the lessee can grant an interest in gross production by an overwriting royalty, why shouldn't the lessee be able to sell an in interest in net profits and convey depletable interest even if it's for a cash consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.581" offset="5002240">This would be a simple rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.685" offset="5006733">It would be a workable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.039" offset="5012062">Everyone would know precisely where everyone stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.586" offset="5026273">If you didn't have to concern yourself with whether the peculiar circumstances of this case or another case fitted in to the rationality of Kirby and Burton-Sutton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.930" offset="5079667">If the Court agrees with us, then it makes no difference that the upland owners obtained this interest by conveying an interest in their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.399" offset="5117492">It could be consider just as though the upland owners had bought for cash from Southwest the right to receive 24.5% of its net profits for the term of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.567" offset="5166184">And that ought to be as depletable in the hands of the upland owners as if for cash, they had bought the right to receive one-eighth of gross production from the leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.910" offset="5207562">In other words, if this Court will put them both on the same basis so that an interest in net profits which stand precisely as an interest in gross production, we think that we have a logical extension in the two case and would have a rule which would make for more uniform results and would be administratively a lot more workable and taxpayers would be able to predict where they stand rather than having to worry about whether particular circumstances do or do not fall within the share or reliance of Kirby and Burton-Sutton.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.789" offset="5403063">The respondent, Huntington Beach Company, is one of the upland owners on whose land, the oil wells -- oil wells were located which were drilled under the ocean and into the tidelands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.861" offset="5455412">The respondent received 17.75% of the net profits from the production of that oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.217" offset="5488849">The respondent claimed depletion on those net profits payments and depletion was allowed by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.691" offset="5526674">The respondent contends that in accordance with the opinion of the court below that the depletion deduction should be a portioned to those who share in the income from production in accordance with their shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.649" offset="5594593">That is to say, in the case of the respondent, depletion should be allowed on its net profits payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.140" offset="5632522">In the case of Southwest, depletion should be allowed only on the portion of the income which it is entitled to keep and depletion should be allowed on the portion of the income from production which it is required to pay over, the royalties to the State and the net profits payments to the upland owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.386" offset="5729489">Of course, these net profit payments are taxable to the upland owners and, of course, the royalties and the net profits payments that are paid by Southwest would not be taxable to Southwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.019" offset="5812036">The facts in -- in this case differ in no material respect from those in the companion case, 286.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.637" offset="5854459">They have been stated by the government counsel, but I would like to emphasize the steps involved in bringing about the production of oil and gas on the state lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.023" offset="5904091">The first step was a call for bids on the state lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.311" offset="5929169">Under that call, the only persons eligible to bid for the state lease were the upland owners or those to whom the upland owners were willing to sell their property or grant the use of their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.224" offset="5992803">They were not compelled under the state law to grant the use of their property to anybody, certainly not to Southwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.455" offset="6025718">Southwest at that time had been an inactive corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.994" offset="6043899">It own no property, controlled no property in the area and had no -- no right to insist that Huntington Beach or the other upland owners convey to it the right to use the property in order to make it eligible for the bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.318" offset="6117251">The upland owners chose not to bid for the state lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.521" offset="6142015">They chose not to sell their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.267" offset="6152986">They chose instead to grant the use of their property to Southwest and make Southwest eligible to bid on the state lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.294" offset="6193110">Southwest, thereby, become the only eligible bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.927" offset="6215680">And, of course, the state lease was granted to Southwest, but that lease was not unconditional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.752" offset="6246922">Southwest had no right under that lease to enter upon the tidelands and produce upon the tidelands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.453" offset="6277747">The lease required that Southwest use the property of the upland owners and drill its wells through the upland owners' property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.991" offset="6319961">So that the grant by the State of the right to extract the oil from the -- the submerged lands was not effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.844" offset="6355278">It was not complete without the grant that was made by the upland owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.259" offset="6384953">Both grants were necessary in order to permit Southwest to enter upon the production of oil and gas in the tidelands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.057" offset="6436153">In consideration of the grant of the use of their property, Southwest agreed to pay the upland owners 24.5% of the net profits, in the case of the respondent, 17.75% of the net profits from all of the operation on the state lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.536" offset="6538136">The upland owners were not limited to a share in the net profits from the wells that were located on their lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.093" offset="6680346">The grant of the use of a property, the agreement covering the share in net profits were inseparably apart of the state lease.The state lease was not operated without the grant that was made by the upland owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.779" offset="6751086">No production could have taken place without that grant and the grant of the use of a property, the right to share in the profits were coextensive with the lease.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.593" offset="7922312">The Government's theory is predicated on its interpretation of the Burton-Sutton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.531" offset="7946031">That case involved a right to share in the net profits under a lease which the Gulf Refining Company had obtained and then in turn assigned to an operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.907" offset="8007576">The operator agreed to pay Gulf 50% of the net profits and this Court held that that net profits interest standing alone was depletable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.133" offset="8056477">We found no difference between a net profits payment and the situation in Kirby where there was a royalty interest together with a share in the net profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.761" offset="8118962">The Government had contended in Burton-Sutton that a net profits interest standing alone was not depletable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.052" offset="8152189">If the taxpayer had to own something else to give him his economic interest, a royalty or other interest, then this Court held that that was not true, that the net profits interest standing alone was depletable because the mark of an economic interest was a share in the income from production and sole dependency on production for that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.889" offset="8251455">The Burton-Sutton case left open this question, if the Gulf Refining Company which held a share in the net profits sold that net profits interest for cash or if the operator turned around and sold another portion of the net profits to a third party when the purchaser of that net profits interest be entitled to depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.775" offset="8371096">And the Government contends that it would be because the taxpayer would have a capital investment in the production of the oil and gas, it could look solely to the production for a return of its capital or the possibility of profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.302" offset="8441208">We conquer in that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.636" offset="8450508">But the respondent does not rest its case on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.222" offset="8476839">There are additional factors here which attached to -- to our net profits interest which we believe require the recognition of an economic interest on the part of respondent without regard to the acceptance to the government's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.112" offset="8560431">Now, there are four factors that we think are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.100" offset="8576313">One, the upland owners had control over the right to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.150" offset="8612571">Two, there was required and continuing use of their property and production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.579" offset="8646217">Three, the operator, Southwest, in order to acquire its economic interest had as a condition precedent to pay the upland owners a share in the net profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.273" offset="8721032">And -- and the fourth factor is the continuing control which the upland owners exercised over the production.I'd like to take up each one of those points briefly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2337.118" offset="9348389">In order to get the right to produce, Southwest had to pay the upland owners, the share of the profits, just as it had to pay the State of California royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.271" offset="9401051">In our opinion, there is no difference in substance or effect between the royalty that Southwest had to pay to the State to acquire the right to produce and the share in the net profits that it had to pay to the upland owners in order to acquire the right to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.617" offset="9474403">In both cases, those payments diminished the economic interest of Southwest because to the extent that Southwest is required to pay these amounts out of income from production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.194" offset="9532709">It does not have that much income from production on which it could claim or should -- should get depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.848" offset="9567295">Well, if I may, I'd like to take up these four points that I think represent factors applicable here requiring the recognition of our interest, economic interest whether or not the broad rule of Burton-Sutton or the broad interpretation of Burton-Sutton is accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.070" offset="9660186">The first one, is matter of control over the right to produce just as in Burton-Sutton, the upland owners have the choice of operating the property themselves taking and bidding on the state lease and they are the only ones eligible if they chose to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.789" offset="9731135">They chose not to grant the use of their property to Southwest or permitting someone else to operate the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.290" offset="9769064">In Burton-Sutton, Gulf shows not to operate the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.168" offset="9788604">It assigned the lease to an operator for sharing the net profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.049" offset="9808144">And we contend that our position is identical in effect with the situation that Gulf had in Burton-Sutton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.052" offset="9844193">On the second point, the use of our property in production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.717" offset="9870838">The key to depletion is an economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.020" offset="9892049">If more is needed unless -- then -- then a share in the net income is not our economic interest confirmed by the fact that our property must be used both under the law and -- and the easement, the state lease, to produce that oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.875" offset="9967491">I've discussed the third point, the matter of -- of the -- the payment by Southwest of the net profits as a condition precedent to acquiring its -- its right to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.930" offset="10023706">The fourth element is the continuing control that the upland owners hand over the production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.105" offset="10056411">At the time, the use of the uplands was granted to Southwest, an agreement was entered into which prescribed in detail how Southwest was to conduct its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.590" offset="10114299">It had to conform the good drilling practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.728" offset="10126838">It had to give complete information on the pumps, mechanical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.777" offset="10147004">It had to conform to any conservation program that a majority of the producers should agree to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.256" offset="10176993">And in extracting the oil, it had to agree to follow good engineering practice and those requirements were essentially the same as the requirements that were laid down in the state lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.794" offset="10227148">And they both reflect the concern that one who has an interest in production exercises or expresses in seeing to it that there is maximum economic recovery from the oil and gas to assure maximum income on its share of the -- the income from production.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky</label>
            <text syncTime="2927.553" offset="11710171">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.164" offset="11712575">May I just comment on the regulations?</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.585" offset="11730338">The existing regulations were amended by a treasury decision as I recall in the early part of 1940 to reflect the O'Donnell, Elbe and Bankline cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.253" offset="11776940">Now, Your Honor is correct that those regulations were not applicable in Burton-Sutton but they were the regulations applicable in Kirby, and you will find it in Footnote 4 of the Kirby opinion, a quotation from the regulations which include that disputed sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.992" offset="11863876">Now, of course, in both Burton-Sutton and in Kirby, we were contending that the regulations were a correct interpretation of the statute which had all along remained unchanged so that our position had been calling that the applicable regulation were governing in Kirby and that what they stated was the correct rule of law not only because they governed those particular years, but because there were a correct interpretation of the statute which has remained unchanged all the way through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.489" offset="11997936">And as, Your Honor, may recall in Burton-Sutton, the Court, in speaking of the regulations, broadly said that they're not very helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.306" offset="12029179">They tell us what to do once you decided what is a rent or royalty but they don't tell us what is a rent or royalty.And in -- the net profit payment regulation was intended to be specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.373" offset="12081424">After Kirby and Burton-Sutton, we think they are equally unhelpful in deciding the issue posed by this case because, had the regulations been applied literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.660" offset="12122593">I think the Government should have prevailed in both Kirby and Burton-Sutton because to the extent that they say that an interest in net profits is not an economic interest.That was precisely what the Court held was not true in both Kirby and Burton-Sutton.</text>
