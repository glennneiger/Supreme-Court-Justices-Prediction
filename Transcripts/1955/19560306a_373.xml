            <text syncTime="26.104" offset="104385">It's a federal income tax case and presents the question, whether an employee of a corporation who receives the right which he exercises to buy stock in the corporation at a price, which is considerably lower than the fair market price of the stock when he buys it.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.751" offset="226952">It's taxable on the gain thus realized.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="96.976" offset="387866">That's right, sir, on the -- on his exercise of the option right given to him by the corporation on the purchase of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.198" offset="424751">Now, the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals have held that the employee, the taxpayer in this case is not taxable on that gain, and there is no dispute as to the facts which are in the main stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.742" offset="490893">This agreement here as in the lower courts centers solely, entirely on the legal validity of the criteria or standards used by the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals in reaching the conclusion that no tax was due even though there was an undoubted economic gain or benefit received by the employee when he purchased this stock at the favorable price.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.912" offset="635611">The -- before going into the detailed facts of the case, I should like if I may, in order to put the legal issue in the proper frame of reference, to refer briefly to the statutory provision which all agree is controlling here, that Section 22(a) of the 1939 Revenue Code which is set out in our brief at page 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.184" offset="752640">Section 22 (a) is the basic definition of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.913" offset="775628">It provides that gross income includes gains, profits and income derived from salaries, wages or compensation for personal service and the material that's omitted there indicated by the italics is just a parenthetical clause providing that -- including personal service for -- personal services rendered by officers of states, or compensation for personal service of whatever kind and in whatever form paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.891" offset="915540">And it goes on to specify various categories of income, and there is a concluding catchall clause which the Court is familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.549" offset="958171">That was before the Court in last term in the so-called windfall cases, the Glenshaw and General American Investors cases involving punitive damages under the antitrust laws and the Security Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.266" offset="1013029">The catchall clause, or gains or profits and -- and income derived from any source whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.735" offset="1038838">And as the Court has noted on several occasions in recent terms that the statutory definition of income is so broad as to include all gains and only those gains are excluded from tax which Congress specifically excludes.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.766" offset="1118981">And we have set out here the provisions of Section 22 (b) (3), which provides that the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or inheritance shall not be included in the gross income and shall be exempt from taxation under this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.418" offset="1217620">The comprehensiveness of the -- of the statute has been noted not only in the cases last term, but also in -- in cases such as the Rankin case involving illegally extorted payments and the Robertson case involving a prize received for a musical composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.919" offset="1315631">But perhaps, the most important case in this context is the case of Commissioner against Smith in 324 U.S. 177 in which -- which is the leading case dealing with taxability of gains received under employee stock options and Mr. Chief Justice Stone's statement in that opinion has been frequently quoted that Section 22 (a) is broad enough to include any gains or benefits concertedly conferred on employees as compensation, whatever the form or mode that that compensation is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.147" offset="1488562">Now, under the broad statutory provision as construed by the Court, it's therefore immaterial that the compensation does not take the form of cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.239" offset="1528895">It takes the form of property and merchandize and stocks, or bonds or whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.485" offset="1545927">It's also immaterial that the compensation is not given pursuant to a legal obligation or contract obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.164" offset="1576647">It's given voluntarily such as tips or Christmas bonus or something of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.482" offset="1605904">It's taxable as compensation nonetheless, and it's also immaterial that the compensation takes the form of a byproduct of what might be called a noncompensatory, non-compensation motive on part of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.317" offset="1689182">For example, in the Robertson case where the taxpayer was held to realize taxable income, what he received was a prize in the context for a symphonic composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.286" offset="1757100">The donor of the prize, Mr. Henry Reichhold was a philanthropist.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.063" offset="1776222">And his interest was not in compensating Mr. Robertson.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.011" offset="1792000">His interest was in -- in furthering the cause of symphonic music generally and the particular cause of the Detroit symphony.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.895" offset="1823556">And the Court held that nevertheless, since the payment was made in return for services rendered, it was taxable as income regardless of Mr. Reichhold's motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.765" offset="1870994">As another example, if an automobile manufacturer were to decide for purposes of publicity or advertising, that it would compensate each of its employees, in part at least by giving them a new car each year, the value of that car would still be taxable to the employee even though an incidental purpose was served by the employee made them essential requirements of this new employee's --</text>

            <text syncTime="516.015" offset="2063987">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.626" offset="2066495">The -- the fining is that in this case, there was no compensation because the employer intended the employee to acquire a proprietary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.260" offset="2116963">Now, we say that the Tax Court reached the wrong conclusion, made the wrong finding of fact because it asked the wrong question.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.129" offset="2148415">We don't think that that -- under the statute that is the test and I shall elaborate my argument on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.918" offset="2167641">I think it would be better to do so after going into the details of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.465" offset="2185822">Now, in this case, the tax years involved are 1946 and 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.583" offset="2214243">The taxpayer was the New York sales manager of a -- of a Michigan chemical company, a rather small company which enjoyed a substantial expansion and prosperity in the immediate post war period, largely as a result of its sales of DDT in which it had done pioneering work for the army beginning early in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.771" offset="2331063">In March 1944, the stockholders and directors of the company apparently realizing that it was on the brink of a period of expansion, decided upon a plan for allocation of 10,000 shares of common stock authorized but not issued to the -- to such key employees that should be determined by the Board of Directors over the ensuing three years and the option price, price specified was $5, which at that time was slightly more than the market price of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.687" offset="2502740">There's been a stipulation that March 1944 when the plan, the general plan was agreed upon, the price was $4.50.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.218" offset="2548820">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.978" offset="2555820">Now, on June 29th 1944 and I shall be reading from the record beginning at page 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.307" offset="2581211">In June 1944, the Executive Vice President of the corporation, a man named T.C. Davis wrote to the taxpayer that -- informing him of the stockholder's action and setting aside this 10,000 share allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.818" offset="2655190">He stated in the letter that the purpose of this is to provide an incentive to key employees, especially to permit such men to participate in the success of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.925" offset="2695628">In the next paragraph, he says, “Allotment of the stock will be made by the committee for the key men of the company on results accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.761" offset="2735020">In other words, you will stand on your own record and participate in the stock purchase plan to the extent of your efforts, cooperation, and results.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.968" offset="2771801">And in this letter, he tells him that he has been tentatively alloted 10 shares, and he repeats that the -- that in January 1945, when they actually make the -- the final allocation to particular employees, that assignment will be made on the basis of results accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.792" offset="2859154">I am now reading from the middle of page 18, “You may be assigned a greater or less amount of stock based entirely upon your individual results and that of the entire organization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="725.314" offset="2901159">Then, it goes on to enumerate the basic factors which will be taken into account, the labor costs, general efficiency in operation, increase in production and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.634" offset="2942433">And Mr. Davis said, “May I suggest that that you select those things wherein you can make the greatest contribution and strive to make the kind of record of which you and I maybe proud.”</text>
            <text syncTime="745.476" offset="2981825">Then, on January 18th 1945, Mr. Davis informs the taxpayer that he has been definitely alloted 150 shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.675" offset="3026651">And he says, this is in the middle of page 19, “That this allotment of stock is made by the committee and is in recognition of your contribution and efforts in making the operation of the company successful,” and he concludes that letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.883" offset="3103451">On top of page 20, you'll of course understand that further allotments of stock under our plan will be recommended by the committee during 1945 and 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.068" offset="3140232">It is up to you to justify your participation in the plan during the next two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.263" offset="3164996">In January 1946, once again, Mr. Davis writes to inform Mr. LoBue that he has received a further allotment of 150 shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.550" offset="3226122">And in the paragraph beginning at the bottom of page 20, he says, “The committee's selection of the names of employees to receive the right to purchase this stock, the number of shares assigned to each selectee is determined by the committee after a careful appraisal of the individual's contribution to the company in the way of job performance during the past year.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.832" offset="3303236">In other words, the extent of your participation to the plan is based on how well you handle your job during the year.”</text>
            <text syncTime="835.078" offset="3340225">Then, in January 1947, Mr. LoBue is alloted 40 shares which represented his portion of the balance of the shares which have been available, and this letter too contains statements that the allocations were made after a careful appraisal of his contribution and it concludes, “I congratulate you on having earned this recognition given to you by the committee and trust that your future services, suggestions and interest in the corporation's welfare will warrant even greater recognition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="871.997" offset="3487974">Now, Mr. LoBue exercised his rights under these three options by purchasing 300 shares of stock in 1946 at a time when the market price of the stock was $30.50 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.915" offset="3559654">His -- he paid $5 a share, which meant that for $1500, he acquired stock worth $9600, and the value of that gain, perhaps, can be measured by the fact that his regular salary was $6600 a year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.026" offset="4948010">What we are saying is that the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals applied the wrong test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.446" offset="4973714">Now, the test that was applied is known as the proprietary interest versus compensation test, and it -- it's fairly stated in the opinion of the Court of Appeals on page 160, Judge Maris points out that a virtually unbroken line of cases supports the Tax Court in holding that if the -- now, we disagree with Judge Maris as the authority, but that's not material at this point, the cases support the Tax Court in holding that if the grant of a stock option by a corporation to its employee is intended as additional compensation to him, the excess of the fair market value over, the option price is income taxable to him when the option is exercised.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.196" offset="5188754">But he goes on to say, “But on the other hand, if the grant of the option is intended to provide him with a proprietary interest in the business, no taxable gain is recognized when the option is exercised, and whether the grant of the option is the one or the other being in every case a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.378" offset="5289482">So, the question is under the view ,taken by the -- of the law taken by the Court of Appeals and Tax Court, you asked was this intended to his compensation?</text>

            <text syncTime="1342.192" offset="5368686">And curiously, in -- in almost every opinion that I have examined on this subject, the -- the latter question is asked first, if the -- if the employer is found to have intended the employee to acquire proprietary interest in the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.768" offset="5459069">That is conclusive of the question of whether there was compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.073" offset="5476206">Now, that -- that is the approach that was taken by the Tax Court in this case, and that was the -- apparently approved by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.255" offset="5516957">Now, we -- our difficulty with the proprietary interest test begins with our -- our inability to find any statutory authority for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.675" offset="5582681">Under the -- under the rule of the Court of Appeals, there's a -- there is a middle ground between taxable compensation on the one hand and a nontaxable gift on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.242" offset="5648927">Right in the middle is an area of a benefit or gain received by an employee which isn't taxable to him not because it's a gift.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.019" offset="6868010">It-s -- it's an option which can be exercised only during employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.325" offset="6885251">The -- the stock has to be held for at least two years after the option is given or six months after the option is exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.033" offset="6932062">The employee can't hold more than 10% of the stock of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.918" offset="6951602">It's not transferable and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.647" offset="6958498">There are quite a number of restrictions that have to be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.730" offset="6966857">And if all those conditions are met, then under the 1950 statute, the employee does not pay a tax when he buys the stock, but when he sells it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.265" offset="7013042">But then, he is taxed at the ordinary income tax rates to the extent of the difference between the option price and the market price, and the statute further provides that unlike this case, no deduction can be taken by the corporation and there is a further provision which I think is especially important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.425" offset="7097678">If the employee dies without selling the stock, his estate has to pay an income tax just if he had sold it during his lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.650" offset="7138534">Now, under the decision of the Third Circuit in this case, the practical result is that the employee, when he buys the -- when he buys the stock, pays no stock at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.530" offset="7190047">If he dies without selling the stock, his estate pays no tax because they take it on the basis of its market value at the time of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.203" offset="7228709">If he does sell it during his lifetime, he is taxed at the ordinary -- at the long-term capital gain rate, and the difference between the result in this case which turns on the existence of a proprietary interest motive and the 1950 Amendment in which there is no reference at all for proprietary interest, the only conditions are those that I have enumerated, seems to us to be highly significant.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_f_barrett" startTime="1844.795" stopTime="2412.760">
            <label>Mr. Richard F. Barrett</label>
            <text syncTime="1844.795" offset="7379174">There are two basic questions presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.255" offset="7401012">The first is, is there a presumption under Section 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, a conclusive presumption that stock options are granted to employees for one reason only, to compensate?</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.456" offset="7477812">The commissioner says, and as regulation say, that there is such a conclusive presumption that the courts are precluded from looking into the true intent of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.617" offset="7534446">The taxpayer says, “There is no such conclusive presumption and that if it is established as a fact that there is no purpose to compensate through the transaction, then the exercise of the option represents a mere purchase of property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.876" offset="7615425">The Tax Court found that there was no intention to compensate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.101" offset="7640398">It did not find, as my Brother has said, that there was no intention to compensate because there was an intention to give a proprietary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.669" offset="7682612">It laid out very expressly and clearly of the criteria that if there is any intention to compensate, then there is compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.449" offset="7717721">But if there is a complete absence of intent to compensate and there happens to be another motive, which is the wish to sell stock to the employee, then the sale is a pure sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.145" offset="7776549">The second question is whether this finding of the Tax Court, which is concurred in by the Circuit Court of Appeals, will be reviewed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.040" offset="7816150">Of course, it's a conclusive presumption of the Commissioner's regulations as upheld, then, this Court has no place for such a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.079" offset="7860245">The Commissioner, however, argues in the alternative that the -- this Court will review this finding of fact and that it should reverse it as erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.351" offset="7909355">The taxpayer contends that it is not subject to review here under well established principles of this Court, that such a two-court finding of fact will not, under Section -- Rule 52 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure be reviewed except in the presence of very exceptional circumstances which are not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.050" offset="8020114">Now, it has been stated that the taxpayer contends there is conclusive presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.424" offset="8041639">I might say parenthetically that Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked for the gist of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.421" offset="8077584">They were not stated exactly as I understand them to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.588" offset="8094302">They lay down a flat mandate without any exception to the gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.262" offset="8116976">All words relating to love and affection, they state, and this appears at page 5 of the Commissioner's brief, the top of page 5, “If property is transferred by an employer to an employee for an amount,” this is any property, stock, or any other property, “for an amount less than its fair market value, regardless of whether the transfer is in the form of a sale or exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.699" offset="8230766">The difference between the amount paid for the property and the amount of its fair market value is in the nature of compensation and shall be included in the gross income of the employee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.745" offset="8290952">And those are the only words in the statute, in the regulation, which is significant to this case that bear upon today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.614" offset="8342361">If the fact establishes that there is no purpose to compensate, the taxpayer says, “It's a transaction purchase, a purchase transaction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.963" offset="8379768">Once this absence of intent to compensate is established, the employee relationship becomes insignificant and the employee stands in the same position as any other purchaser of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.505" offset="8433998">This view has been consistently supported by the courts including this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.955" offset="8459807">In Smith against the United States, to which my Brother referred, this Court held that the exercise of an option by an employee resulted in compensation on the expressed grounds that the option was given in consideration to services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.538" offset="8542145">In Palmer against the United States, 302 U.S. 63, an advantageous exercise by stockholders of an option granted to them was held by this Court not to create a dividend since the purpose and intention of the grinding of the option was not to distribute earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.369" offset="8641411">The Palmer case is of special significance here because of the high degree of analogy in fact in the issues of the cases to the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.513" offset="8681953">In both cases, at the time of the adoption of the option plan, market value was either equal to or greater than as is true in this case, the option price in both cases when the option was exercised, market price was in excess of the price paid pursuant to the option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.791" offset="8775158">This Court said in the Palmer case, “That one does not subject himself to income tax by the mere purchase of property even at less than its true value and the taxable gain does not accrue to him before he sells or otherwise discloses of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.384" offset="8877453">The Commissioner contended that this discount in the Palmer case represented a dividend to the stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.749" offset="8910994">This was rejected by the Court on the grounds, the expressed grounds that there was no purpose or intention to distribute a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.990" offset="8947879">This is precisely the principle that the lower courts have applied in this case and in all other stock option cases involving employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.953" offset="8995736">But the Commissioner argues that purpose and intention are immaterial where there is the employee relationship that the courts, if there such a relationship precluded from looking in to the question of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.712" offset="9066789">The influence of the employee relationship is so overriding in the view of the Commissioner as to require a complicit presumption of law that compensation is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.908" offset="9115585">Now, this Court has, on many occasions, expressed that this favor was statutory conclusive presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.282" offset="9145051">As in violation of the due process provisions of the Fifth and Fourth Amendments, I do not cite these cases in my brief, so I like to take the liberty of citing three of the leading cases at this time, Helvering against Rankin, 295 U.S. 123, Heiner against Donnan, 285 U.S. 312, Hoeper against Tax Commission, 284 U.S. 206.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.745" offset="9278903">Certainly, regulations, which attempt to provide a conclusive presumption, must themselves be arbitrary and invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.214" offset="9316833">Now, the Commissioner's conception of the law has not always been as it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.019" offset="9340029">From 1939 to 1946, his regulations regarding employee stock options provided that compensation was a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.431" offset="9389662">He also applied the same factual test in his regulations regarding stockholder's stock options.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.029" offset="9424039">He also expressed this view in his brief in the Smith case to which we have referred before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.708" offset="9454759">At Page 14 of his brief, the Commissioner stated, “In determining whether a particular transaction involved,” this is his -- this is his brief in the Smith case, previously before this Court where he expressed this view of the transaction compared to what he is expressing now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.026" offset="9552039">“In determining whether a particular transaction involves the payment of compensation for personal services, the decisive factor is that of intention.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.055" offset="9596134">This is of course a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.516" offset="9614002">This is exactly the position of the courts below in this case and in all other stock option cases of employees and it's the taxpayer's position here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2437.852" offset="9751406">The effective date of them was the decision of this Court in the Smith case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.667" offset="9770632">And the Smith case offers no discernible basis for a chain from a determination of fact as to whether compensation exist to a determination to a conclusive presumption that it does, because in the Smith case, this Court said the options resulted in compensation because they were as a fact given in consideration for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.103" offset="9876376">As a matter of fact, that fact was admitted and conceded in the Tax Court and in the Circuit Court of appeals and the case came to this Court on the fact that the options were given as compensation for service.</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.350" offset="10205309">Under the Jacobson case before this Court, it's cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.130" offset="10224431">I can't remember the volume and page at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.024" offset="10240000">If there was no attempt by the seller to get all that he could for the property, it was a gift for income tax purposes and exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.689" offset="10282736">Now, I would like to address my remarks to the point that Mr. Justice Harlan raised and go on to the change in 1946 and the regulations where this change was made to a conclusive presumption that because of the employer relationship, there must be compensation in every stock option case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.700" offset="10378762">The interesting point about that is, at the same time, there was no change made in the stockholder option regulations that related to dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.770" offset="10418991">Those remained the same that it would still open the question of facts just as to whether the purpose and intention was to declare a dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.120" offset="10460473">There seems to be a rather hypnotic influence exercised on the Commissioner by the employee relationship, one and one makes two for a stockholder, but the same in the case of an employee makes three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.980" offset="10515853">The regulations admit of no exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.912" offset="10527556">Now, the Commissioner does do lip service in this case in his argument, not in these regulations to one exception, gift, but it's through lip service because the whole rationale of his argument is that if you're an employee, the employer will not make a gift to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.210" offset="10604774">However, he says there's no middle ground that may not be a purchase transaction such as this case held there could be if that is the intent and purpose in the Palmer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.037" offset="10656078">Now, the logical invalidity of the Commissioner's position can be illustrated by a rather homely and down to earth illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.724" offset="10706860">Corporation X, which is a closely held corporation and whose stock has no established market value, announces to all its employees that the stockholders are making an offer to them that they may buy a stock for a period of three months at the market price for the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.103" offset="10800379">The announcement states that this is in response to request from employees that they would be allowed to become stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.637" offset="10834547">And the stockholders think that it would be sound for the corporation to have its employees participate in the stock ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.408" offset="10865580">The announcement also states that because of the unestablished market value of the stock, three independent competent appraisers will be selected to determine the market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.996" offset="10931931">Many of the stockholders accept the offer, and in each case, the fair market value which is to be the purchase price, is determined on a bonafide careful basis by this committee of independent, expert and competent appraisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.419" offset="11001626">Some stockholders turned down this opportunity because they object to the price determined as being too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.527" offset="11042064">The Commissioner, using capitalization of earnings and book value and other evaluation formula methods, determines that the market price is an excess of that for which the stock was sold, and the Tax Court uphold this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.581" offset="11126282">Now, under the regulations, that discount for market is conclusively presumed to be compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.044" offset="11160137">It's perfectly clear that no gift is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.275" offset="11173094">It is also -- it's equally clear that the stock option was granted because of the employee relationship, but it certainly is equally clear that there was no intention to compensate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.367" offset="11233384">It was merely an intention to make the sale of stock, but because the sale was at a market price, in excess of the option price, the Commissioner says there is a conclusive presumption of compensation.</text>
