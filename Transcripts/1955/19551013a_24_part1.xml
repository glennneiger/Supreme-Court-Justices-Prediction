            <text syncTime="16.811" offset="67187">Situation is that I represent the plaintiff who was injured while she was sitting in a parked automobile at Agana on Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.780" offset="111073">The accident happened about 10:30 at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.634" offset="126433">A -- an army corporal named Seabourn was driving an army truck, crashed into the plaintiffs automobile and caused her very serious and permanent injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.456" offset="173767">The negligence and the injuries are admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.824" offset="187246">The sole question really here is whether at the time of the accident the corporal, Seabourn, was acting within the scope of employment or the line of duty as set forth and within the meaning of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.898" offset="251507">The facts preceding were that the accident happened at 10:30 pm.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.614" offset="274390">At about 10 -- and about 8 o'clock that night, the corporal, in accordance with army custom, that is custom that have been prevalent on this post on Guam had gotten a so-called trip ticket made out for official business.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.061" offset="356206">In accordance with the custom, the trip tickets made out for official business where the means by which the army personnel would secure a vehicle for recreation purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="180.848" offset="723383">That's the type of trip ticket and to use that for the purpose of getting the vehicle to drive for recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.373" offset="757447">In other words, the trip tickets were all made out for official business but the men would use those for the purpose of driving the vehicle for recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.816" offset="799242">That was the custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.688" offset="806661">The officers on this particular post had two jeeps.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.360" offset="821394">They were available to the men three of these trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.907" offset="835605">Now, the post there, so the Court may understand Guam and the post, the town of Agana is situated some distance from the post, it would be necessary to have a vehicle to go for recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.355" offset="889417">For example to the non-commissioned officers' club which the man did on this night in question preceding the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.649" offset="918570">The place of their recreation into which they went was from the post to the non-commissioned officers' club.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.796" offset="951171">There, as the fact showed, the men drank.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.197" offset="968725">The corporal, Seabourn, the driver at this non-commissioned officers' club, drank to excess and to such an excess that he in driving them from the non-commissioned officers' club to Agana, caused his two companions to want to leave him, they got out.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.152" offset="1040509">Schmidt and Vincent got out.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.978" offset="1047824">And then the next thing that happened was that this girl was hit when she was in the automobile so far as Seabourn, the corporal, remembers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry C. Clausen</label>
            <text syncTime="276.836" offset="1107278">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.724" offset="1110831">The custom had been in practice there for 18 months preceding this and as I state, the officers had for themselves two jeeps, the man had the three trucks for the purpose of recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.630" offset="1162449">And again I point out that when I'm saying recreation, I'm putting the setting of this recreation not in the United States, although the Murphey case is applicable for -- in connection with our Northern District of California in the town of Klamath.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.124" offset="1224411">But here is an island outpost where the men are cooped up, where the island itself is 34 miles long by some four to 10 miles wide whereby reason of the overseas status of the men, they are on duty 24 hours a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.169" offset="1300584">And where -- where it is necessary, I point out again, to have vehicles to get about.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.895" offset="1327543">In any event the -- the basic error in my opinion here was when the trial court and the Circuit Court of Appeals failed to apply the rule of respondeat superior which is the law of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.969" offset="1379788">Now, it is our -- it is our contention that under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the law which governs is the law of the place where the -- where the accident occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.096" offset="1424300">In this case, it was Guam and the code of Guam, specifically Section 2338 of their Guamanian Code incorporates the same numbered section of the California Civil Code which adopts the common law doctrine of a respondeat superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.382" offset="1493473">And therefore, it is our contention that in this particular case, the law to be applied would have been the California law and which was applied in the Johnson case and which was applied in the Murphey case, two prior decisions of our own Circuit held.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.596" offset="1558361">I -- I say therefore, the -- and I'll just briefly read the -- the trial court rendered an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.064" offset="1592216">It was the belief of the trial court and it says here, even assuming that the practice, this practice to which I've adverted testified to by Seabourn and Schmidt was known and permitted by the officer in charge, it would not make the United States liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.924" offset="1659611">The sovereign can not be sued without its consent but by the Tort's Claim of -- Claims Act of United States has consented to be sued for the negligence of its employees only when they are acting within the scope of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.715" offset="1706841">And then the Court says federal law in decisions control similarly the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals goes on to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.747" offset="1742890">But in dealing with the problem of federal liability for tortious acts of members of the military and naval forces a wholly different situation is presented because Congress saw fit to adopt the drastic modification of the master and servant doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.770" offset="1803076">Now, it is my contention that that is -- is -- does violence to the Act itself because the Act states that their claims for personal injury caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of the employee of the Government while acting within the scope of the -- of the employment are permissible if a private person in accordance with the law of the place where the act or the omission occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.807" offset="1907148">And that has been so held by my own Circuit, the Ninth Circuit in the Johnson and the Murphey cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.794" offset="1935151">Now, in the -- in the Johnson case, which was a case of 1950, involved Guam also.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.868" offset="1967438">There, the injured person suffered an injury while riding in a navy reconverted ambulance driven by a navy chief petty officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.842" offset="2003278">And the fact showed that at the time of the injury, he was on a deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.190" offset="2028669">He had deviated from his regular assignment which was to deliver a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.626" offset="2050403">But the Court held that this -- here he was primarily motivated by his own desire to serve the master according to the respondeat theory and by reason of this deviation, it nevertheless granted the master liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.716" offset="2126785">Now, the Court further pointed out on this Johnson case, 181 F.2d 577, that California law controls in Guam and that the same scope and significance should be given the law as applied to the military in Guam as would be given under the California courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.767" offset="2223020">Furthermore, that where this driver did combine with his business for the master the -- his own personal business, nevertheless, the master will be made liable when third persons are hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.039" offset="2288118">And moreover that the mere fact that the man was driving a government vehicle and the mere fact that he was a government employee on the issue of -- of authority to drive does justify the inference that there was authority and so that even though there was a departure, a personal errand of himself, the Government was liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.411" offset="2597616">In other words, if the master has reasonable cause, if he has a reasonable ground that he can foresee.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.468" offset="2633770">Other words, if the master may foresee what will happen, if the master permits an employee to drive an automobile that he then in California, Your Honors, held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.528" offset="2682044">The Court in the Johnson case discusses that aspect, the Court in the Murphey case discusses that aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.836" offset="2707331">In other words, when we thought of a -- of vicarious responsibility for -- or liability rather in the respondeat theory aspect, there are two -- two hazards which a master should bear in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.618" offset="2778384">One is, that his employee may deviate and may ask demand to deliver a report as in the Johnson case when you must realize that he may deviate.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.228" offset="2824882">Another, Your Honor, is that the master ought to foresee the probability of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.875" offset="2851422">In other words, the zone of the risk is important also and is not a facet.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.460" offset="2873783">Here, Your Honor, if I may just advert to my own case, Seabourn is a soldier, he is a corporal and certainly, if Uncle Sam lets him take the car to go to an NCO club, a non-commissioned officers' club and there drink.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.832" offset="2951314">Then the United States, as the master, should foresee that the soldier will drink to excess.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.179" offset="6004715">The basic contention in this case has been that there was this custom so-called loose practice of allowing trucks to be taken out for joyriding purposes by soldiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.533" offset="6054034">But this case of course was tried before a District Court and we have District Court findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.470" offset="6329783">The Court of Appeals too, in passing on this alleged error finding that Seabourn's use of the vehicle was unauthorized and that his practice to answer Judge -- Mr. Justice Clark's question that this practice, the record shows at page 180, this practice was without -- without the knowledge or approval of their superior officers.</text>
