            <text syncTime="2038.472" offset="8153861">And I answered that when the land was condemned as of course frequently has been in the case of irrigation works, construction of roads and so on, the proceeds of the land are paid into the individual account of the Indian, subject to withdrawal by him under supervision.</text>
