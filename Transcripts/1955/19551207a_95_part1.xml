            <label>Mr. Charles A. Horsky</label>
            <text syncTime="29.083" offset="116297">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.099" offset="124343">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.757" offset="147017">It involves a substantial question as to the applicability of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the system of criminal appeals presently existing in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.974" offset="211801">Specifically, it involves the question whether either or both of those clauses are violated by a system of criminal appeals which makes a full review in a criminal case dependent upon the filing in the -- in the Supreme Court of a transcript of the proceeding but which makes no provision by which an indigent defendant may secure a copy of that transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.168" offset="320575">The facts on which the case comes here are relatively simple and can be quickly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.194" offset="348682">The two petitioners were indicted in Illinois for armed robbery and after a trial they were convicted and sentenced respectively to 5 to 10 years and 10 to 15 years in the Illinois penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.153" offset="420571">Following the denial of motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, the petitioners filed in the nisi prius court, the Criminal Court of Cook County, Illinois, a motion for transcript of proceedings and court record without cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.288" offset="505104">This motion alleged in substance that the petitioners needed the court records and the transcript of the proceedings in order to perfect an appeal to the Supreme Court of Illinois that they believe that there were appealable errors in the record and that they were without funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.735" offset="570932">They also alleged that the failure of the State of Illinois to supply a record on which they could perfect an appeal would deny them the equal protection of the laws and due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.808" offset="635193">This motion was denied by the trial court without hearing and without argument in February 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.862" offset="663406">In April, the petitioners filed a petition under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.916" offset="703634">That Act provides a summary means by which prisoners confined in Illinois penitentiaries may seek a review of any claim that they are being held in violation of their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.605" offset="778344">The petition in this case asserted that the failure -- it asserted essentially the same grounds as were asserted in the previous motion that the failure of the State of Illinois to accord them a record upon which they could perfect an appeal when they were unable to do so because of indigence and when they believed that there were appealable errors denied them rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.612" offset="886387">The state attorney in the Criminal Court of Cook County, Illinois moved to dismiss on the ground that that raised no substantial question of either state or federal constitutional law and the District Judge dismissed the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.677" offset="950648">The petitioners then filed a timely petition for a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Illinois seeking a review of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.536" offset="986070">The Supreme Court of Illinois, although allowing the petitioners to proceed in forma pauperis as they had requested, also dismissed the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.657" offset="1022537">Its memorandum order, which is quite short, appears in the record at page 13 and I think it's worth reading it so we'll be sure what the court below decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.405" offset="1065587">After reciting some of the facts which I recited here, the opinion states, â€œPetitioners' soul contention is that they were deprived the due process of law and the equal protection of the laws, in that, they were financially unable to purchase a bill of exceptions and were therefore unable to -- to obtain a complete review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.417" offset="1153567">This charge presents no substantial constitutional question and the writs of error are therefore denied."</text>
            <text syncTime="295.097" offset="1180317">Thereupon this Court granted a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.275" offset="1201006">Now, basic to the issue which this case presents is an understanding of exactly what the criminal appeals system in Illinois amounts to today.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.425" offset="1245623">It was recently reviewed by this Court in the Jennings case but I think it well to resummarize it so we'll have it in our mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.444" offset="1281776">The procedure for review of the criminal conviction in Illinois is basically by a writ of error and Illinois has provided that writs of error in all criminal cases are writs of right and shall be issued as of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.192" offset="1340709">The scope of the review on a writ of error, however, may vary widely.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.817" offset="1367249">It is possible to have in Illinois -- I don't mean it's possible, there are in Illinois, frequently, appeals for writs of error on what is known as the clerk's mandatory record or what might be called the common law record.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.994" offset="1427958">The clerk maintains this record in every case, the indictment, the plea, the arraignment of plea and the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.991" offset="1467873">When review on writ of error to the Supreme Court of Illinois is on a record of that sort, the Supreme Court does and it must limit its review to the questions which are open on the face of those documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.790" offset="2959151">As I said, the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act provides a method by which one confined in a -- an Illinois penitentiary may challenge the legality of this confinement for the -- may challenge the legality of this confinement on the ground that there were constitutional infirmatives in the proceeding by which he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.266" offset="3049012">That under -- the procedure under that statute is the procedure adopted here, a petition is filed in a nisi prius court and upon a proper showing, the nisi prius judge is authorized to require the official court reporter to type up such portions of the transcript or all of the transcript necessary to determine the constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.029" offset="3156114">The cost of typing up the transcript in that situation for an indigent is born by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.092" offset="3188297">The Supreme Court of Illinois has also held, however, that the Post-Conviction Hearing Act procedures are not to be regarded as an alternative method by which to review trial errors which do not rise to constitutional magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.221" offset="3260813">It is not a device by which the ordinary errors which might require a reversal of a conviction but which do not involve in and of themselves a denial of a constitutional right can be reviewed, such claims as the improper admission or exclusion of evidence, the inadequacy or the inaccuracy of the judges' charge, whether the evidence of courts diverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.766" offset="3366975">Those questions can be reviewed in Illinois only on a bill of exceptions and I think I can fairly say that it is conceded here as indeed I believe it was conceded by the Attorney General in the Jennings case that for the indigent prisoner, such as the petitioner, there is no such thing as a review of trial error for them except he be sentenced today.</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.415" offset="5693649">In Illinois for the past 50 years, the percentage of reversal in criminal appeals has run between 20% and 40%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.730" offset="5734818">Other States are not substantially different, although they tend to be a little bit low.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.257" offset="5756970">Now, in order to be sure that we were not distorting the disadvantage to the petitioner who could, I will assume, appeal on a common law record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.196" offset="5812767">We examined each of the decisions in the Illinois Supreme Court during the last two calendar years in 1953 and 1954 to determine the basis upon which the reversals were held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.069" offset="5864176">And in the 1935, I think it was, cases that were there involved, we found that with two exceptions, each reversal was on the basis of trial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.201" offset="5920705">The details of that are set out in Appendix B to the brief if you are interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.218" offset="5944842">The other thing I should like to say is that although that demonstrates only what the percentage of reversal is in cases which are appealed, I think --</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Horsky</label>
            <text syncTime="1500.097" offset="6000327">That's right and with -- I think it is at least fair to say that there is at least the similar likelihood of review of error had there been a review of cases which could not be appealed because the defendants were indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.559" offset="6058214">I say that for this reason, and I think it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.655" offset="6082560">In the ordinary case in the Illinois Criminal Court, the fact that there is going to be no appeal on trial error is apparent before the proceeding starts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.347" offset="6133342">When the defendant comes into court and says to the judge, "Your Honor, I have no money to employ a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.761" offset="6158942">I wish you would appoint one for me."</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.186" offset="6168660">Now, whether he does or not, he -- whether he gets a lawyer, he serves notice for all practical purposes that if convicted, he cannot review the proceedings which led to his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.521" offset="6218083">Now, I have no doubt that there are in Illinois and there would be everywhere judges and prosecutors to whom a situation of that sort would be a challenge -- a challenge to be sure that there was not even the possibility of a prejudicial error in the trial of a person so situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.489" offset="6293943">On the other hand, I have no doubt that there are in Illinois and elsewhere persons on whom that situation would react in a contrary way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.740" offset="6330932">That at least is the teaching, it seems to me, of the almost universal change from a system of final nisi prius decisions in criminal cases to a system of appeal in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.186" offset="6392686">We did not regard it as satisfactory to leave the final decision to the District Judge even though -- even when we were telling him that we were going to do it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.778" offset="6439079">So I think it's fair to state that there is here a substantial tangible disadvantage, there's difference in the quality of justice which is accorded to an indigent defendant as opposed to a non-indigent defendant in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.186" offset="6504699">I think that inequality is patent as a fact and I think it no great step to go to the -- to the assertion that it is also a denial of the equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.744" offset="6562900">Let me anticipate a moment by saying that I shall also contend that it is a violation of due process of law, but I should like to reserve that point and deal first with the question of whether it violates the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.844" offset="6615353">It seems to me that it ought almost to go without arguing.If there is one principle which we all ought to accept as a perfectly certain principle, it is that both rich people and poor people should stand alike at the bar of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.074" offset="6708245">Magna Carta itself declared to no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse right or justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.209" offset="6748787">It seems to me that here we have an example of a patent country difference in the quality of justice between rich and poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.268" offset="6789016">We are selling justice in the sense that the indigent cannot purchase the same quality as the rich man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.792" offset="6823079">Now, the State says well, we ought not to pay too much attention to that argument because after all Magna Carta is a goal only and it's still a long, long way off in reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.586" offset="6886296">The poor man suffers in criminal administration, a variety of hardships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.953" offset="6907716">He can't conduct an investigation before his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.000" offset="6931958">He may not be able to employ expert witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.972" offset="6947840">He may not be able to employ as good counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.787" offset="6963096">He may not be able to raise bail and substantial (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.547" offset="6978142">He may have no alternative, real alternative when the sentence is fine or imprisonment and there probably are a variety of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.606" offset="7018371">Now, that's -- the State says, therefore, why should we worry about this particular inequality?</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.170" offset="7048673">That seems to me to be a very curious argument and one which I certainly hope will not appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.756" offset="7075004">What it says in effect is that because we cannot change all of the inequalities which exist between the rich and the poor in the administration of criminal court, let's not concern ourselves with a particular inequality which we can do something about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.706" offset="7150759">That is not the way I understand the Constitution operates and I certainly hope it is not the way it will operate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.308" offset="7185136">Here is a tangible concrete disadvantage which in most States, as I will come to in a moment, has been eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.846" offset="7223380">It preexists in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.429" offset="7233620">It doesn't seem to me that this Court should sanction its continuation in Illinois simply because it cannot achieve the goal of Magna Carta in one decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.516" offset="7274057">Now, I should also like to spend just a moment on the distinction which is made in Illinois between the indigent who was sentenced to death and the indigent who was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.597" offset="7326302">We have contended in our brief as was contended in the petition for certiorari that that likewise denies due -- equal protection of the law to these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.033" offset="7368098">Now, true, this Court has recognized as recently his last term in the Williams case, Williams against Georgia, that death sentences or capital cases may be treated differently in the law for when the -- when the distinction between a death sentence and a life sentence becomes relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.895" offset="7459527">I submit that although that principle is true, it has no application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.907" offset="7483559">That it ought not to be a relevant consideration in determining the quality of justice which an individual defendant is accorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.731" offset="7534864">I see no reason why Illinois should be able to say constitutionally that a man who is sentenced to death may have a full review of the record upon which that sentence rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.125" offset="7580421">But the man who is sentenced to 99 years for murder, as was the case in Carter v.Illinois which was reviewed here last two terms ago, is unable to secure that kind of a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.056" offset="7636219">Now, the State says the answer to that particular branch of our argument is easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.628" offset="7658475">It's furnished by the right to counsel cases which we rely on in the due process argument, they say it supports then in this aspect of the equal protection argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.186" offset="7700689">The argument runs as they may get that in the decisions of this Court, there is a distinction made in the right to counsel rule under the Fourteenth Amendment between cases -- between capital cases, I don't think if death sentence is the capital case, and non-capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.830" offset="7787311">And they point to the difference which the Court has announced from time to time in the line of cases which begin with Powell against Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.750" offset="7826913">I think the difference does -- the argument doesn't aid them because I believe in all of those cases involving the right to counsel, this Court has made it clear that there is one principle which will govern and that is that the defendant will not be allowed to be prejudiced by his inability to employ counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.944" offset="7911758">Now, it will -- it will find prejudice more easily in the case of a capital crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.886" offset="7943523">It will find prejudice more easily in other circumstances but that is one of the factors which it will look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.834" offset="7967242">But in no case whether it be a capital case or a non-capital case, as I understand the decisions of this Court, will it permit a State to refuse counsel to a defendant, an indigent defendant, when he is actually prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.175" offset="8032653">Now, in this case, there can be no doubt that the man who cannot appeal is actually prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.476" offset="8065881">There's a difference in the quality of the justice which he gets in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.775" offset="8083017">I think the right to counsel cases do not aid the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.084" offset="8104333">Now, let me turn to the question of whether or not this situation also violates the Due Process Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.900" offset="8243513">I think the State -- the brief for the State of Illinois suggests one possible answer, which I would -- I would not urge because I don't know enough about the Illinois procedure to be sure that it's feasible, but they suggest that in the event that this Court determines that it is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to deny an indigent defendant who wants to appeal a transcript to publish he can base it then the procedure of the Post-Conviction Hearing Act under which this comes up might be available by -- and supply the mechanics for testing those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.043" offset="8396069">Under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, as I explained before, the petitioner comes in and asserts his claim of denial of a constitutional right, the judge upon a proper showing can order such portions of the transcript printed as are necessary to determine that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.329" offset="8469316">Now, conceivably as I read the State's brief, conceivably that is a way in which that question could be raised by anyone imprisoned in Illinois now who did not appeal because he was unable to afford a transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.628" offset="8542459">Another possibility is that Illinois would promptly do something about it in terms something like they handle the right to counsel situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.879" offset="8579448">They amended the statutes to make -- to make clear what happened at the time of arraignment and any case coming up to this Court from Illinois involving the right to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2315.798" offset="9263125">Well, the reason I say that, Your Honor, and I think it probably would be the solution that would be adopted in most cases is that most cases have adopted that solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.534" offset="9302100">Let me turn to the -- briefly to the question of the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.971" offset="9323833">I do not argue, and the question is not here, whether the due process requires an appeal in every criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.647" offset="9358524">That question was not raised by the petitioner and it is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.815" offset="9379213">I suspect someday it will be a nice question but for present purposes we need not worry about it because Illinois does have a system of criminal appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.149" offset="9424562">It purports to say in its statute that writs of error in criminal cases shall be writs of right and shall issue of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.662" offset="9458625">What we do say is that the State, once having decided to establish a system of criminal appeal, must make that system conform to the Due Process Clause and that a system which purports to give to a criminal defendant a right to appeal but which withholds it from him when he is without fund unless he'd be sentence to death does not consist with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.233" offset="9584849">Now, it is certainly true that what kind of process in criminal appellate procedures is due process is a very difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.613" offset="9638452">There is no touch to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.128" offset="9648483">However, I don't think the issue was completely at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.567" offset="9666247">The decisions of this Court have suggested that the answer is to be found in concepts of fundamental justice or fundamental fairness as determined from time to time by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.699" offset="9734792">And I think that that kind of an approach which we can make to this situation, to this question is exemplified by the decision of Mr. Justice Stone in District of Columbia against Clawans in the 300 United States which I've quoted at page 44 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.665" offset="9822563">He points out that due -- what -- what constitutes these standards of fairness and justice may vary from generation to generation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.594" offset="9866344">And he goes on to say that doubts must be resolved, not subjectively by recourse of the judge to his own sympathy and emotion, but by objective standards such as may be observed in the laws and practices of the community taken as a gauge of its social and ethical judgements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.619" offset="9958400">Now, that I think does not rule out an examination of the history of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.192" offset="9988702">We can certainly best understand where we are if we understand where we have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.669" offset="10010645">And in -- particularly in this situation, I think we can best understand the laws and practices of the community to which I will come in a moment, if I take a few more minutes to explain a little of the history of the interrelated development, of protection of indigent criminal defenses and criminal appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.076" offset="10116284">There are two aspects of history of criminal procedures which I think have a somewhat parallel history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.920" offset="10159647">One of them concerns the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.505" offset="10169992">One of them concerns the right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.375" offset="10185456">In the right to counsel cases, in the very early days of England, there was a complete equality between rich and poor, a negative equality, neither were allowed to have counsel except only in misdemeanor cases which were sometimes called trespasses and analogize to civil cases in which counsel were permitted from the very earliest time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.000" offset="10291931">That situation which seems literally incredible today preexisted in England until almost the middle of the 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.009" offset="10331951">In the United States, the colonies by 1789 were somewhat ahead of England and by that time almost all of them had provisions which permitted counsel to persons accused of felonies or treason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.028" offset="10416065">Those statutes did not, however, necessarily employ that an indigent defendant to have counsel assigned to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.925" offset="10455667">And on that -- on that question, the States varied quite widely as this Court elaborately spelled out in Betts v.Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.573" offset="10498194">However, when the question finally came to this Court, the Court did not feel bound by the inequities of 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.214" offset="10540826">It applied the principle which I have just read from Chief Justice Stone and it has now been laid down by this Court that as so far as the right to counsel is concerned, indeed of the federal courts nor the state courts, will an indigent defendant be permitted to be prejudiced by his financial inability to procure counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.172" offset="10640614">The line of cases in the federal -- on the federal side beginning with Johnson against Zerbst and on the state side beginning with Powell against Alabama, I think I need not detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.918" offset="10695576">This situation with respect to the right of appeal seems to me comparable, although it is admittedly a considerably later development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.388" offset="10737476">Again we begin in early English history with the same negative sort of inequality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.817" offset="10771226">There were no appeals by either the rich or the poor in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.536" offset="10794109">And again we find that the criminal procedure lagged substantially behind the civil procedure in England, bills -- writs of error and bills of exceptions had been authorized in civil cases in England in 1295 in the Statute of Westminster Second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.646" offset="10866521">But it was the middle of the 19th Century before even writs of error became generally available in criminal cases and it was only in 1907 when the Criminal Appeal Act was passed that England really has accomplished an adequate system of criminal appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2746.353" offset="10985326">There were writs of error in state courts in -- in the States in criminal cases from fairly early days, Your Honor, although bills of exceptions which make that writ of error meaningful were sometimes substantially later than the initial grant of the right of a writ of error.</text>

            <text syncTime="2778.005" offset="11111967">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.702" offset="11118759">There was a felt need for appellate review in the courts but it did not achieve a real substantially universal acceptance, I should say, within the last 50 or 75 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.577" offset="11162227">I should add in all fairness that Illinois, in this respect, stands close to the front rank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.726" offset="11202873">There have been writs of error and bills of exceptions for those who could afford them in Illinois since 1827.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.372" offset="11245401">Now, this growth of the appellate system -- of the system of criminal appeals obviously created the potentialities for discrimination between the rich people and the poor people who couldn't afford the appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.507" offset="11309976">And in fact because protections of the indigent always tend to lag behind the progress, a real inequality did develop and there were substantial voices raised that criminal appeal should be abolished because the inequity, the patent glaring inequity which they supplied between the rich and the poor just was impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.472" offset="11425855">The answer was found, however, not in the abolition of criminal appeal, those had become too well-established as part of what we regard as fair and just to be abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.814" offset="11475174">The answer was found rather in general enactment of provisions to protect the indigent in this new appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.065" offset="11512163">Now, it is these statutes, these protections, which we believe supply the objective proof of our present day ethical and moral standards to which Mr. Justice Stone referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.930" offset="11575693">They're set out in Appendix C to our brief and so far as we could do it, we have tried to make them complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.943" offset="11603696">In the United States, there are 29 States where the indigent defendant, upon proof of nothing but his indigence, is supplied with the transcript for the purpose of his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.491" offset="11661897">In some States, it is done by the State paying the official reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.156" offset="11688542">In some States, it's done by simply making that a part of the official reporters job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.970" offset="11715814">There are seven additional States in which the right of the indigent to a transcript is discretionary and you add to that group the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.151" offset="11772552">There are four additional States in which alternative methods of full criminal appellate review are provided without the necessity for a transcript but in which the indigent defendant is not prejudiced by his indigence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.802" offset="11847158">There are six States, of which Illinois is one, which limit the right to cases of serious crimes but there are only two States which joined Illinois in limiting it to cases in which a death sentence has been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.315" offset="11917166">There are two States about which we were unable to be certain and we did not classify under our two States which provide no relief for an indigent prisoner so far as we could determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.478" offset="11969829">That pattern of general acceptance of the principle that an indigent should not be prejudiced in his right to appeal applies not only in the United States but throughout, so far as we know, the English speaking world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.603" offset="12034403">England and as most of the commonwealth countries, and the references are in the brief, supply a transcript or whatever is necessary to permit an indigent defendant to take a full appeal and to have a full review without cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.824" offset="12111203">And it is interesting to note that in America, in military courts, that has been the practice since the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.422" offset="12149656">Now, I should like to correct one inadvertent error which perhaps I clause the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.950" offset="12191765">In our Appendix C, we entitled it the following States provide free transcripts to all paupers convicted of felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.931" offset="12227709">This case involves felony so we examined other States with regard to felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.038" offset="12256131">The statutes, however, are not limited to felonies unless they are specifically limited by the text of Appendix C.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.062" offset="12284238">Those statutes are equally applicable in any criminal appeal whether it be a felony or a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.116" offset="12316421">I'm sorry, the -- the title mislead Mr. Wines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.354" offset="12337319">Now, I should like also to advert just a moment before I close to one other aspect of modern criminal practice which seems to me also relevant and that is the development of official court reporters who are now, I think, provided in substantially every State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.122" offset="12412447">Before there were official court reporters, the problem of supplying a transcript to an indigent defendant who wanted to appeal was obviously very great.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.036" offset="12464065">In the usual case, there was no transcript made unless the prosecution itself happened to want one for its own purposes and consequently it was impossible to supply transcript to the -- to the indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.533" offset="12526132">The only way to avoid that was to have or would have been to have a court reporter, a private court reporter attend every trial and transcribe it in order that it -- the notes would be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.255" offset="12588931">I don't mean transcribe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.221" offset="12592797">I mean take it down in order that the notes would be available in the event that the defendant later did desire to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.222" offset="12628846">That lead to the fact, I think, that it is -- in the federal courts, the day upon which official court reporters were provided that the Federal Government provided free transcripts for indigent defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.419" offset="12697600">It required that step in the federal courts, a step long delayed before it was able to make feasibly this further step available to indigent defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.002" offset="12743993">It is also perhaps significant on this respect that in Illinois, the date of the statute, which grants a transcript free to a person convicted of death, convicted and sentenced to death, dates from the year in which official court reporters were authorized in the courts of that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.487" offset="12845871">They do exist now if -- as I say in almost every State and they do in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.305" offset="12865202">Illinois has court reporters, official reporters who take down the proceedings, all the proceedings in all of the regular criminal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.143" offset="12908565">And there are, so far as I can determine, no courts in which an appeal lies on a bill of exceptions in which that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.607" offset="12954331">There are courts called Justice of the Peace Courts or police courts throughout the State in which proceedings, criminal proceedings may be had but appeal in those -- from those courts is on a de novo basis, that a record is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.682" offset="13018697">In Chicago, where those courts are combined, the police courts and the Justice of the Peace -- the Peace Courts are combined into one court called the Municipal Court of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.645" offset="13066553">There is provision for an official record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.755" offset="13086929">Now, it may be said that all of these developments are so recent that you cannot distill a constitutional protection out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.316" offset="13137189">True, they are recently but we don't necessarily, as -- as demonstrated by this Court in many cases, have to go back to 1789 to find out what due process means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.571" offset="13186194">I think we accept what Justice Stone said, we look at the laws and practices of the community and we look at the question, which is presented by this case, in the light of all of the factors which are presently existing, the universality of criminal appeals recognized in every State, the universality almost of protection for the indigent which was made necessary by the fact that those appeals were provided, the feasibility of the system through the universal acceptance of court reporters, although let me hasten to say I don't believe the issue should defend on whether it costs a lot or costs a little.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.697" offset="13370723">But when we take all of those things together, it seems to me that we can say that this situation presented by these petitioners is not consistent with the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.460" offset="13417744">If there were a statute before Your Honors which said in so many words appeals in criminal cases are permitted in Illinois only if the person convicted has an income of $10,000, I submit it would be so patently unconstitutional that it would be reversed without arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.057" offset="13500186">This statute which accomplishes exactly the same thing, $10,000 figure maybe wrong but which in effect -- in necessary effect denies to the poor person the right to appeal seems to me should have the same answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.203" offset="13564761">I submit the decision should -- below should be reversed with instructions either to afford this -- these petitioner an appeal, a full appeal or to dismiss them from custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="3562.913" offset="14251572">Mr. Horsky is clear and simple and complete in an entirely accurate statement of the facts in this case as to save me the task and spared Your Honors the labor of listening to any further statement of the facts on my part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.465" offset="14341851">Also I should like to begin by saying that Mr. Horsky's outline and description of Illinois appellate practice in criminal cases is extremely accurate and remarkably complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.957" offset="14423771">It was quite clear to me but of course I am familiar with that practice and if it's not improper for me to say so, it does great credit to a lawyer who so far as I know has never had a criminal case in the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.799" offset="14511125">So I shan't have to duplicate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.096" offset="14536307">I should like however and I should like to say before addressing the constitutional questions in this case so there won't be any misunderstanding or doubt about it, I'm quite sure that the Attorney General of Illinois joins me in feeling and saying that the view that every indigent prisoner should have -- a free transcript should have a plenary appellate review is an enlightened, humane, highly commendable and eminently desirable point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.746" offset="14730971">I should be the last one to try to stop any prisoner from getting a free transcript if it were otherwise available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.013" offset="14776007">There's no doubt about the desirability of it at all that I can possibly see.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.919" offset="14799621">Sometimes it said that would impose an intolerable burden on reviewing courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.131" offset="14832431">My answer to that would be that if the reviewing courts find the review of the cases of poor people, intolerable, the Thirteenth Amendment protects them against continuing that intolerable task.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.141" offset="14912470">However, the question before this Court, one which I will argue with all the earnest seriousness that I can, is not whether it's desirable to give every indigent prisoner a transcript of record, a bill of exceptions raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.536" offset="15022080">The important question is deep question but in one sense, one sense only, the narrow question whether due process or equal protection are of such constitutional exigency is to require that --</text>
