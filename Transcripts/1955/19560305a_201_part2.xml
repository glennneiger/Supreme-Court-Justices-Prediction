            <text syncTime="11.127" offset="44408">In -- in briefest statement, Your Honor, the position of the petitioner is that as a matter of due process derived not from deportation law because there is no deportation law on the point, but derived from three areas which we feel in principle are parallel and controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.673" offset="166661">Firstly, criminal law and due process criminal law, and secondly, insanity proceedings, and thirdly, asexualization operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.555" offset="218175">We find in the law a requirement by due process that there be accorded in all these fields where liberty, body, or life is an issue, a quality of process different and distinct from the civil process which is sufficient to determine property causes between private individuals where the parties are relatively equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.124" offset="340428">And that where in the law, liberty or life or body hangs in balance and the -- one of the parties is the Government with greatly superior resources and capacities that the public and the law, as well as the individual, requires that there be observed certain minimum basic fundamentals as a safeguard to ensure that the law shall not take life or liberty in error or carelessly but only as and where the law truly applied, specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.108" offset="512418">And that of the minimums which due process requires to secure a fair trial, not merely fair to the defendant, but fair in the sense of ensuring a just and honest judgment among those minimums and indeed very basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.519" offset="597995">One perhaps of the most fundamental is the minimum requirement that the judgment and trial be to the face of the person concerned and accused that he be present to be confronted by the Court, the witnesses, and the evidence.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Murrish</label>
            <text syncTime="204.315" offset="817215">Well, confrontation too, confrontation, where confrontation was possible like a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.647" offset="842501">Then, if the witness dies or is too ill to be able actually come to trial or is too old or as a matter of fact, I think, the case most illustrating it and I don't, at the moment, recall and name it.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.523" offset="910002">I think it was the Mott's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.589" offset="918256">If the witness is beyond the process and jurisdiction of the trying body and cannot be possibly be brought where indeed the Government must choose between a trial with confrontation -- I mean between a trial without producing the witness and no trial at all because it is impossible to render it, then, in those rare situations, the law is compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.473" offset="1041868">As a matter of fact, that is well-discussed in the basic cases which state that in criminal law, the purpose of requiring confrontation is the very opposite of the civil law permitting depositions and that the very biggest purpose was to exclude as a matter of due process from civil -- from criminal cases, the free use of depositions permitted and appropriate in civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.048" offset="1160150">And that the reason why is because the fundamental requirement of fairness of confrontation and presence, which is a little more than only confrontation, which should not be forgone if it may be possible to satisfy.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.972" offset="2371814">From that, they derive partly the right to be present because the very right to be tried by a jury includes the right to confront the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="956.626" offset="3826416">I call this Court's attention to its decision, for example in Hopt against Utah where it was earnestly stated that presence is required because of a deep public concern that life not be taken in error or without a fair and a just judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.943" offset="3915755">That -- and the reasoning there is that it would be against the law for the defendant himself to take his life except by and in accordance with law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.960" offset="4039784">And I also note the circumstance that this right is -- is instinctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.394" offset="4069564">There's an instinctive feature in -- in the criminal law cases making this right jurisdictional even where it is not placed in a constitutional or in a particular statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.932" offset="4171651">And I therefore say that a right so fundamental there because the reason for it is that it is indispensable to securing fairness of judgment must equally be secured where the purpose and need for fairness is comparable and parallel as it is, whether or not the proceeding been denominated civil wherever life or body or liberty are at issue because that is the reason which calls in public terms for carefulness and safeguard in judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2184.684" offset="8738691">One of the features here is that the hearing officer in Hawaii, not once exercised any supervision or restraint over the character of the examination or asked a single testing question, the examining officer asked questions which -- which any counsel present could have readily objected to leading and conclusionary questions and then, when that's significant beyond that, when the depositions are offered in Los Angeles, the middle two-thirds of the transcript consists of offering question by question and answer by answer, the deposition and there are maybe 200 objections, including objections that it would seem impossible to disallow and not a single objection is sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2461.990" offset="9847954">Well, this Court in Schneider against Massachusetts has already indicated that there is a broader right and a different right from the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, a right of presence arising from the due process portion of the Fifth Amendment which does obtain in criminal causes and the same comparable right has been extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.752" offset="9938965">And I would emphasize and I would feel that in principle, it must plainly be in principle that in the strictly civil proceedings of insanity confinement or about the operation that we would -- it would not be contemplated that a man could be put behind bars allegedly for his own best interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.641" offset="10030498">And in a strictly civil proceeding if he denied, indeed, that he was insane and the evidence against him if a picture of this record, a photograph of this record were transported or could be into an insanity proceeding if we could conceive of a federal court having such jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.179" offset="10108656">And a man being confined as insane in Los Angeles by witnesses, who appeared in Hawaii while the man was not present, was not represented, I -- I can't conceive but that the principle of fair trial of due process would apply there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.455" offset="10177724">And I reason that since that is civil and every bit of civil as this deportation, the controlling circumstances the jeopardy to liberty and to life and that the basic principle being that society cannot tolerate error and unsafeguard of judgments were a man's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.513" offset="10269989">As a matter of fact, I feel that the respondent's brief tends to confirm my principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.550" offset="10298096">Half of respondent's cases are strictly civil cases or civil statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.624" offset="10322442">One, for example, deals with protecting perishable seeds, a statute protecting seeds and hays from impurities and imports there's permitted liberal depositions in the proceedings affecting that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.476" offset="10385868">The civil cases affect tort damages, a cargo is injured or damaged in an ocean trip and the parties are permitted freely to take civil deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.590" offset="10430276">It's my contention that these do not parallel the right to life and to liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.214" offset="10460787">And that a liberty proceeding is not a due process proceeding unless the fundamentals prescribed by due process including the right of presence as in insanity and the operation cases is respected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2677.099" offset="10708323">It should always be respected particularly where the matter is not sufficient, is not established by other evidence independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.738" offset="10746880">And I would think, that if the only witness available in a deportation case to establish a substantive and -- and crucial issue lived in China that the witness would have to come from China or provisions would have to be made for confrontation of the witness there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.475" offset="10821799">Somehow, confrontation would have to be had, but the more so in the case at bar where the entire evidence and relating to the substantive basis, not to alienage or something like burden, but the basis for the deportation comparable in all respects to a criminal proceeding or insanity proceeding in such a situation at least, the entirety of the trial and all of the witnesses should not be suffered to testify ex parte.</text>

            <text syncTime="2943.183" offset="11772656">And that, as a practical matter, it is impossible to apply in so many things with exactitude, the criminal rule even if it was decided, because our procedure isn't geared that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3987.007" offset="15947964">And in that connection, he said he was at three executive board meetings of the Communist Party, executive board meetings.</text>

            <text syncTime="4024.882" offset="16099474">Now, this is supplemented by the rather weaker testimony, considerably weaker testimony, Mr. Uesugi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.462" offset="16129776">Also, it went to a more literate type of witness, I think, one can -- whether it's English difficulty or not, I don't know that Mr. Hyun was a member of this more cell, these meetings that he belong to.</text>

            <text syncTime="4167.477" offset="16669884">There are statements in my opponent's brief that they're used as an identifying picture, a means of identification his attorney's passport in which his name would appear on the state service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.310" offset="16729234">Well, the passport is not printed in the printed record here but a photostat of it is in the record that's on file, the original record that's on file in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.310" offset="16769149">And it appeared today, one's been talking the third set, pretty much like our passports in that one sheet of picture and the other sheet has a lot of attorneys' writing, but there is a name David Hyun in English on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.283" offset="16833097">Well, I assume it's two different pages and there's just absolutely nothing in the record to suggest that they -- the witnesses were not shown, just the picture, without the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.487" offset="16873848">And secondly, even when a person before the Court knows what his name is, he can't read this record without being perfectly convinced that the one thing nobody had any question about was who they were talking about, not to say between petitioner here identified by the standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.343" offset="16933303">Even the witness who -- we just don't give any information when proven against self-incrimination, immediately recognized, petitioner has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.630" offset="16974472">So, there was, as a result of this, initial deposition taken of which the petitioner was giving notice at the time and place and in fact that he could be represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.767" offset="17023060">It's a normal way of doing this.</text>

            <text syncTime="4264.855" offset="17059318">Now, petitioner wasn't there, but he was given a ride and which, in many cases, my -- people might consider at least it's valuable, is the right to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.516" offset="17118041">And that is, that after the testimony was taken on the record, it was transcribed, it was served, uncounseled for petitioner with, of course, opting petitioner consult with petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.007" offset="17187944">They had all together, I think, about twomonths in which to study it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4311.155" offset="17244578">On March 13th, the hearing convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.317" offset="17265267">Counsel said he hadn't had time to study it thoroughly.</text>

            <text syncTime="4369.592" offset="17478322">It's all difficult for me to believe that it's unconscionable, unfair to say that with all that opportunity when there is no issue of identity in the case, that just because petitioner isn't brought there at government expense, that renders the hearing so unconscionable that must be abrogated as a matter of due process.</text>
