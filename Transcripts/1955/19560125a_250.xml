            <text syncTime="29.041" offset="116088">This case is here on writ of certiorari with the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.829" offset="143256">The principal question which is presented by this case and the two companion cases which follow this one, is whether non-employee union organizers are entitled under the National Labor Relations Act to distribute literature, union literature, on a plant parking lot, where it is either impossible or unreasonably difficult for them to distribute such literature in the vicinity of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.828" offset="275226">The court below thought that there was no warrant for -- under the statute for such an intrusion upon the employer's property and it accordingly it rejected the Board's finding that the employers prohibition directed against these non-employee union organizers from distributing literature on the plant parking lot was an unreasonable impediment to the exercise -- to the employees to exercise their rights under the statute and constitute interference and reframe it in the meaning of Section 8(a)(1) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.084" offset="412317">The Tenth Circuit in the Seamprufe case which follows this one and the Ninth Circuit in (Inaudible) case which is presently pending on the Board's petition for certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="123.225" offset="492878">On the other hand, the Sixth Circuit in the Ranco case which is the third case of the series of cases to be argued and the Fourth Circuit I might say in two cases which are not now before this Court, have agreed with the Board that such a prohibition under these circumstances constitutes interference and restraining in meaning the Section 8(a)(1) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.790" offset="591099">The factual picture in these cases, all three of these cases, I will not attempt to give all at one time now, but I might say that the factual picture in these cases is substantially the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.600" offset="2042358">Now, let me turn briefly to the facts in this case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.222" offset="2068793">The company's plant here is located in Paris, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.578" offset="2086243">They are near -- in a rural area near Paris, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.851" offset="2103380">It's approximately one mile from the city limits of Paris, Texas and approximately several miles from the center of the city of Paris, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.008" offset="2139951">Paris, Texas has a population of approximately 21,000 people.40%, approximately 40% of the -- of the 500 employees of the company, live in Paris, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.560" offset="2202227">The other 60% of the employees live in widely scattered communities within a radius of some 30 miles from the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.318" offset="2241202">There is virtually no public transportation to and from the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.226" offset="2268891">And because of that, virtually, all of the employees ride to and from work in private automobiles where they plant or where they park their automobiles in the plant parking lot which is adjacent to the plant itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.561" offset="2334198">The -- the employees normally do no stop anywhere in the vicinity of the plant either as they are leaving the plant or as they are coming to the plant to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.592" offset="2414341">They normally come on to the plant parking lot, park there, and then go on to the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.416" offset="2437642">And when they leave in the evening they then get into their cars as they normally drive away from the plant will stop -- without stopping anywhere in the vicinity of the plant area.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.306" offset="2469198">And I would presume they would drive on home or the nearby city.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.130" offset="2488424">The -- the parking lot is connected with the highway which passes the plant by driveway which is about 100 yards in length and some 30 feet in width.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.477" offset="2549864">This driveway which connects the parking lot and the state highway is over company property, except for the last 30 some odd feet next to the highway, where it passes a public right of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.238" offset="2612872">Along the road as the -- the maximum speed on this highway as it passes the plant is 60 miles an hour and posted along the plant are no stop -- not stop signs that have been put there by the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.434" offset="2681731">Now, in 1953, the union here was attempting to organize the company's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.763" offset="2714958">And sometime that in several occasions during the summer of that year, they went to the plant and stationed themselves at the -- near the intersection of the state highway or the state highway and this driveway at the place where it is -- crosses the public right of way adjacent to the state highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.508" offset="2798028">I hope I made myself clear as to where they were standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.677" offset="2818612">They started and began to handout literature -- literature to the employees at that place and as a result there was traffic jam that was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.049" offset="2848183">And the local authorities, who meanwhile had been called by the company, ordered the union representatives to discontinue distributing literature at that place because it created this traffic jam and created a serious traffic hazard.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.030" offset="2908056">Thereafter, the union representatives wrote to the company asking for permission to distribute literature on the plant parking lot as the employees came to work or as they left.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.092" offset="2960300">The company replied saying that it has generally forbidden the distribution of any kind of literature on its premises, and for that reason it declined to grant the union's request.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.672" offset="3010664">Simultaneously, with its effort to distribute the literature at the -- near the plant, the union also sought to reach the employees at their homes and in the nearby town of Paris.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.244" offset="3068970">However, the union was able to obtain only the names of about 100 of the 500 employees and was able to mail literature only to the -- to the one-fifth of the working force.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.515" offset="3114005">And while some 60% of the employees have telephones, the union, of course, was able to reach some of them, but record doesn't show just how many they were able to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.480" offset="3157891">And the record also shows that the union reached or contacted or communicated with some of the employees on the streets of the nearby town at the nearby town of Paris.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.051" offset="3200104">These are substantially the facts in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="946.674" offset="3786606">That road leads to a sort of a plant gate and the employees enter into that plant gate to enter the plant itself or gate house as they call it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.711" offset="4130795">I -- we, it's our -- it's the Board's position that unless these union representatives are permitted to have access on this parking lot that they would be unable to reach the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.334" offset="4177293">And that it's either impossible or extremely difficult for them to reach the employees anywhere near in the vicinity of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.930" offset="4207700">And with respect to reaching them away from the plant at their homes and in the city as I will come to later, there are very serious difficulties that the union encounters in attempting to reach them there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.948" offset="4255765">Now, from the facts that I had summarized, the Board found, and I believe I've already indicated this to some extent, the Board found that it was either impossible or unreasonably difficult for the union representatives to distribute literature to the employees away from the plant area in the vicinity of the plant itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.533" offset="4354090">And that this and because of that, the employer's prohibition against the distribution of the literature on the parking lot deprived the employees and the union organizers of an important avenue of communication with respect to the distribution of this literature so as to seriously impede the employees' right, the exercise of their right to receive organizational literature from the -- from the organizers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.518" offset="4462028">The Board concluded that the impediment was serious as to constitute interference within the meaning of Section 8 (a) (1) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.517" offset="4497972">And accordingly, it directed the company to permit the union organizers to distribute literature on the front parking lot subject to reasonable and non-discriminatory regulations in the interest of time efficiency and discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.486" offset="4565891">The court below, as I have already indicated, disagreed with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.034" offset="4588042">It concluded that since these organizers were not employees, but in this, outsiders, non-employee organizers and since in its view the employees could be reached in the nearby town, that the prohibition did not invade or bridge any rights of the employees themselves or constitute a serious impediment to the employees' exercise of their rights under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.975" offset="4715833">As I indicated earlier, the principal distinction between these to these cases or in this case and the LeTourneau case, here is the -- the prohibition here is directed against -- is directed the non-employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.427" offset="4949682">The -- in the LeTourneau case, this Court sustained the Board's ruling which set aside an employer rule which prohibited the employees from distributing literature on the plant parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.781" offset="5043096">This Court agreed with the Board that in that situation, the employer's naked proprietary interest or his naked control over his property, was to be weighed in the balance against the employees' interest in the effective exercise of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.550" offset="5110178">And this Court also agreed with the Board that, since on the one hand, the prohibition was not necessary for the protection of any legitimate interest of the employer and since, on the other hand, it deprived the employers of an important and otherwise appropriate avenue of communication with respect to the distribution and receipt of organizational literature, that the Board, setting aside of the employer's ruling -- rule against the distribution of literature, represented an appropriate and a valid accommodation between the employees' interest and the effective exercise of their rights under the statute and the employer's naked proprietary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.509" offset="5274018">The considerations which underlie that decision, and which we think are relevant here, were that -- were the employees as in that case, at their homes or dwellings scattered over a wide area that it is difficult and often impractical to have any systematic distribution of literature to them at their home.That from a practical standpoint, the logical, the natural and perhaps the most effective place for the distribution of literature is in the plant area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.489" offset="5393868">And that even though, as in that case, the employees were not wholly inaccessible away from the plant as they would have been if they had worked in a mining camp or a lumber camp which was owned by the employer, let them work in a place like that, that even though they were not wholly inaccessible away from the plant, nevertheless, the employer's prohibition against the distribution of the literature on the plant parking lot created such a serious impediment, deprived them of a -- an otherwise appropriate and important avenue of communication that on balance the -- it was -- it was wholly proper for the Board to subordinate the employer's naked proprietary interest to the employees' interest in the effective exercise of their rights including their right to receive organizational literature.</text>

            <text syncTime="2333.040" offset="9332088">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.744" offset="9342955">Mr. Manoli here -- I couldn't expect to know how to make an argument in this Court, when this is the first time and it's been my privilege to appear in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.180" offset="9416620">The first natural impulse when (Inaudible) what my opponent say was to refer to the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.698" offset="9462700">That was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.785" offset="9479105">Intricacies and various considerations were given some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.553" offset="9510139">And then it was decided that probably this Court would dispose of this case without regard to the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.688" offset="9558727">However, it is the position of the respondent that the Fifth Amendment is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.865" offset="9611389">Next, not knowing how to present this case in this Court, I attempted to contemplate the -- or recognize the position of the Board as taken from its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.087" offset="9688294">And then attempted to think of -- of what would be said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.823" offset="9711282">That doesn't fit either at -- at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.985" offset="9735837">So, even at the risk of taking too much of my time, I do want to point out to this Court some things about the facts that are before the Court, some things in particular and then in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.916" offset="9835624">Now, first, I would like to mention that the argument has been made to this Court that these employees a mile out from this country town of Paris, Texas I don't know just how much judicial knowledge the Court takes, the record shows that it is of town of 21,000 people.</text>

            <text syncTime="2485.744" offset="9942936">It's a county seat town and a county seat lawyer is addressing you which probably account for wanting (Inaudible) by the Fifth Amendment instead of the Labor Law, having engaged in General Practice and not a specialized practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.766" offset="10011063">And it's mentioned in the -- the brief of the Board in this case that -- that is, the facts are stated in a negative way, so to speak, and this plant is one mile from the corporate limits, that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.842" offset="10099357">The record may show its several miles from the center of town, if though I will want to give the chamber of commerce that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.140" offset="10136555">But it's unimportant of the question has been asked with reference to what was the situation around this plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.895" offset="10183576">The Court showed an interest in just what the situation was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.704" offset="10202802">And Mr. Manoli correctly told the Court that property just across the road was vacant property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.711" offset="10238746">That it was probably available to anybody and for any lawful use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.532" offset="10270093">That addition by me, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.000" offset="10279915">He only stated correctly that there was a vacant property across the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.621" offset="10306456">This plant is, it is out in the country, it's three quarters of a mile to the first road leaving the farmed market road on which the plant is situated that is traversing it east and west when you travel north from the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.731" offset="10378867">Such is the findings in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.379" offset="10389420">It's some two or three miles south of the plant before a road is reached leading east, either or west from the side of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.409" offset="10445636">Now, it's been stated that the employees leaving that plant normally drive direct home, directly home without stopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.488" offset="10485864">That maybe true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.329" offset="10493283">If there's any evidence in this record to that affect it passed my attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.770" offset="10518988">I just did -- It just as did the evidence in the record which is brought out in the brief of the Board in this case or (Inaudible) that this company policy or company rule not only applies to union organizers and outsiders but it's made to apply to their own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.524" offset="10614073">I didn't remember that until it was noted and then I do find that representative of the company on the witness stand was asked of the trial examiner or of the counsel for general counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.879" offset="10671438">Is it not a fact that you would object under your company policy to permitting the employees to drive to the -- to the distribute literature on a parking lot because it would litter it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.700" offset="10738730">And he gave an affirmative answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.931" offset="10747716">That was something insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.100" offset="10756389">In this case until it reached the -- the Appellate Court and this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.533" offset="10782093">It had no significant in the sense of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.900" offset="10791497">If the evidence shows that those employees drive directly home from the plant why, it was insignificant at the time and it still insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.555" offset="10858162">The union has accessibility or has access rather to the employees of this Babcock &amp; Wilcox plant at Paris, Texas on the streets, in their homes, at meeting halls and at all the other places that are normally found in a county seat town of 21,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.684" offset="10982713">Likewise, they have all the area between the plant and Paris, Texas and all of the area south and east and west to attract the attention of the employees if they should really and energetically desire to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.246" offset="11080934">The record shows that the plant is situated in a farming and grazing community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.859" offset="11107370">The land is either in cultivation or it is in pasture land..</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.199" offset="11132761">So, all of that space around this approximately 100 acres that is occupied for this plant is just as available to the union as it is to any other individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.600" offset="11186364">The record in this case shows that the union did reach the employees right at the plant gate and in mentioning that we certainly do not want to admit to this Court -- admit to this Court that we agree with the contention that it's necessary to carry out for the purposes of the law that the organizers be able to meet with and see and discuss matters with the employees right at the company gate or in the immediate vicinity of the plant if such is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.452" offset="11369744">Nevertheless, they did see them there on three occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.501" offset="11385940">There were at that time approximately 500 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.460" offset="11401822">On one occasion they delivered literature to 325 of the 500 are to -- are delivered 250 pieces of literature to 345.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.609" offset="11478413">On another occasion they delivered a lesser number of pieces of literature up to 250.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.921" offset="11507670">And on another occasion some different number all of which is set out in the brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.392" offset="11553541">Now, they were able to reach the employees in the immediate vicinity with the plant, but we don't want to capitalize that if you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.257" offset="11588963">Of course, our position is that the maternal case is not a kin to the case that's now before this Court that it's different, a proposition all together as has been indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.573" offset="11670256">Mr. Manoli, has said now that the Board does not consider this case different from the LeTourneau case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.019" offset="11744026">Such is the sense of the brief of the Board when it's taken as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.631" offset="11762521">So that seems to be issue on number one maybe that before this Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.454" offset="11789793">If it is we think we are prepared and we think we have demonstrated that we are prepared to show the difference between this case and LeTourneau case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.730" offset="11846844">It has been mentioned in colloquially with Mr. Manoli.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.067" offset="11864189">First, there is an outside organizer not only involved here, there you were dealing with the employees of the plant in Paris, Texas and as we understand property rights, we look upon those employees not only as being employees, but they are persons at the plant, there are licensees there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.007" offset="11991980">They are there to do their work and the fact that they are there working doesn't mean that they will cease breathing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.408" offset="12017580">They've ceased eating, they ceased any usual activity of life and nor does it mean that they will lose all their interest in citizenship when they go to work there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.786" offset="12071079">Therefore, we go along with the idea that no restriction should be put upon their activity in the plant regardless of what it is, unless it interferes with production or discipline within the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.104" offset="12144327">There is nothing like that in this law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.881" offset="12163448">We are simply dealing with the question that I think is fairly and squarely presented by the Court of Appeals in its opinion and that is whether or not on outside organizer shall be accorded or permitted to go on to the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.851" offset="12259370">My authority, not of any constitutional right but by authority of the decision in the LeTourneau case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.123" offset="12300434">That is what the Board seems to base its position upon here, now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.700" offset="12338782">And it's our position that the Board has misconstrued and misapplied of what this honorable court intended by the LeTourneau decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.747" offset="12418926">It's been said in oral argument here that not -- that the immediate vicinity of the plant as stated in the brief of the Board is the most appropriate and the most desirable place to distribute union literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.490" offset="12497920">But now, it's carried one step further and is argued that the plant area itself is the most appropriate place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.172" offset="12556643">And it's also mentioned that in many instances the union organizers have difficulty in communicating with employees because they don't have their names.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.324" offset="12605231">That's not this case now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.896" offset="12619546">The evidence shows and the record shows that the union had communication with the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.952" offset="12651729">That it wrote letters to the tune of 100 or more on different occasions to the employees of the company at page 36 of the brief for respondent, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.846" offset="12783282">The facts in this case when brought to a quick conclusion are that the union organizer sought to avoid going to the homes of people, avoid or sought to avoid seeing them on the streets, sought to avoid going to probably call him on the telephone and sought to avoid writing them letters or by seeing him at the gate of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.326" offset="12929254">Now, then after that was done and a congestion resulted there being a public area between the plant property and the travel portion of highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.803" offset="12975125">And after a letter had been written which is here say insofar as we're concerned telling the union that it was dangerous to distribute literature there he terminated such activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.821" offset="13039282">This case, this matter in this case received very little attention at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.384" offset="13073450">This respondent was charged with 16 separate ungrounded violations of law, so to speak or acts of unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.237" offset="13140846">The Board determined that it was not guilty of any of the 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.863" offset="13163416">This was the 16th and the last and it determined that it was guilty of an unfair labor practice because it did not give permission to the union to distribute a literature upon its premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="3879.470" offset="15517780">I don't believe there are people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3902.073" offset="15608268">That is that, the union cannot readily, if the Court please, just cannot readily, that's the most defining amount and if they cannot readily communicate with the employees of the plant property and that is expensive.</text>
