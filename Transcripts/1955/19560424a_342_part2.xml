        <section startTime="0" stopTime="1261.782">
          <heading>Argument of Bernard Chazen</heading>
          <turn speaker="bernard_chazen" startTime="0.000" stopTime="394.802">
            <label>Mr. Bernard Chazen</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Before -- before the recess, the question was asked as to the relationship of Judge Frank's opinion, a quotation, and the Ryan Stevedoring case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.231" offset="88921">Now, I -- I hope I'm not confusing my own argument when I speak of these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.354" offset="117342">They are analogous but the situation is different factually in each.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.089" offset="136255">In the Ryan case, your problem arises because of the alleged indemnity or because of an alleged indemnity by the shipowner against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.407" offset="185574">So that even if the employer does not insure the shipowner for liability, he has an interest which will be adverse to his own employee and if he gets an award or his insurer gets an award and pays compensation, they are put in a position that if they sue the shipowner, the shipowner may turn around and say, â€œWell, we want you to pay for this on the theory of indemnity."</text>
            <text syncTime="73.551" offset="294139">And that's regardless of whether they actually are the liability insurers for the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.464" offset="317753">This case doesn't involve the problem that you have in the Ryan case, but the effect is the same of anything that is stronger.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.588" offset="354325">Because here, we have a situation where the insurance carrier for the employer of the compensation carrier of Travelers here, also, is the liability insurer for the third party and it is in that situation where there is this conflict of interest that we say that the -- the insurance carrier cannot fulfill an obligation as a trustee that -- that the -- the Act creates a species of trustee relationship between the employer or the insurance carrier and the injured employee and that Congress has entrusted to the employer in that situation the duty to go ahead, if against the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.823" offset="527256">But where you have this type of situation where there is a conflict of interest, then traditionally, the courts have interfered.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.180" offset="556617">The courts have, under equitable principles, made whatever arrangements when necessary to protect the interests of all the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.857" offset="587337">Because, obviously, the insurance company, having an adverse interest with relation to the cause of action of the third party is not in a position in good faith to go ahead and prosecute that cause of action against the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.809" offset="659226">Now, there is a case, which the Court cited below, which is the case of Hunt versus Bank Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.305" offset="693185">I think I have to mention that case in passing because that case is directly in point in this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.704" offset="726727">And that case is held in an identical situation that the employer or that his insurance carrier can't take the cause of action even though he has this inconsistent position and the employer -- and the employee can't do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.193" offset="816692">And that's Hunt versus Bank Line, its 35 F.2d, 136 and it's a 1929 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.947" offset="847726">Now in my brief, I had given the reasons why I think that this case is not sound law.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.093" offset="880327">First of all, the reasoning of the case is in conflict with the reasoning of Judge Learned Hand and Judge Frank insofar as they find that the Act creates a trustee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.439" offset="933721">In the Hunt case, that trustee relationship is specifically rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.940" offset="967680">Secondly, the Hunt case came before the assignment provision of -- of Section 933 was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.334" offset="1009267">At the time of the Hunt case, if the employee took any kind of benefit, whatsoever, even if he got medical benefits, without an award, without any formal action, that automatically operated to assign his cause of action to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.493" offset="1085962">Now, since that time, the Act has been amended but it was in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.444" offset="1109682">And now, the Act requires that in order for an assignment to be affected, there must be an award by a deputy commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.276" offset="1157016">Now, normally, I should explain, as a matter of practice, much of the workers handled by claims examiners and any order which has entered by claims examiner is not such an award as would cause a transfer of the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.586" offset="1226292">So that when the Act was amended, Congress showed that it did not intend to make the rights of the employee exclusive, one or the other, because it is quite possible and it happens quite often that the employee will be paid on an informal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.533" offset="1302047">And as long as he is paid on an informal basis, there is no assignment he can, at anytime, file a notice of election to sue preserve his rights for the balance of his compensation and can sue the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.793" offset="1355128">Even if he is successful in the third party action, the employer has a lien for the money that he's paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.683" offset="1378638">If he's unsuccessful, the employee can always come back and ask for more.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.335" offset="1397238">So that the assumption that's in the Hunt case, that these two remedies are exclusive, I think the Court referred to it as choosing between joint tortfeasor as the spoken in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.973" offset="1459827">It's not analogous.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.426" offset="1465678">Congress did not intend to have that type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.694" offset="1478740">The -- the relationship which arises in the employer-employee relationship is a contractual one and it's not analogous to a choice between two joint tortfeasors.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.101" offset="1528372">The only thing that Congress intended from a plain reading of the statue to give the employer was the right to proceed on his own, to collect fact the money that he has paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.885" offset="1571527">I think that is all it that can be fairly read --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="450.811" offset="1803180">I have a question in my own mind as to whether you can translate that into requiring a joinder or reassignment of this cause of action as distinguished of an independent suit against the trustee for breach of trust.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_chazen" startTime="466.733" stopTime="550.083">
            <label>Mr. Bernard Chazen</label>
            <text syncTime="466.733" offset="1866919">Well, as I understand the cases that we've had up to now and I, often, I can't recall any case decided by this Court, but that -- certainly, the Circuit Courts have held that so far as there is no conflict of interest, the employer or the insurance carrier has absolute discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.092" offset="1952287">There is some language in the cases that if there was some fraud shown in connection with it that the Court might then intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.897" offset="1979559">But as along as it -- it's completely discretionary, he can sue, he can refuse to sue, he can do whatever he wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.573" offset="2010279">That's left entirely in the hands of the employer and that had -- that I think is the gist of the decisions which I've read up to now.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.472" offset="2041835">So that in that type of situation under the Act, I would say, that Congress has made a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.063" offset="2064196">Congress has said, in most situations, that the employer may use his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.710" offset="2094811">Now, and they -- they haven't indicated that there would be an -- any interference with it but when the conflict of interest comes in, I don't think Congress intended to permit the employer to use this device to avoid liability on the other end.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.981" offset="2155833">I think that Congress, as a matter of judicial discretion, decided that the employer would have enough interest in recoupment to act in good faith for himself and the injured employee.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="550.083" stopTime="553.324">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="550.083" offset="2200242">This case was disposed of on the pleadings that I take with this.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_chazen" startTime="553.324" stopTime="932.521">
            <label>Mr. Bernard Chazen</label>
            <text syncTime="553.324" offset="2213198">This case was disposed of on the pleadings except that at the final hearing, before Judge Ryan, which was supposed to be the full hearing, he limited the issue solely to the question of whether this assignment was an effective defense because it was brought to his attention the two judges have already ruled on the question and he felt, apparently, that it was unnecessary to have a full trial since that issue seemed to be determined at least so far as the trial court level was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.464" offset="2325838">Now, I think that, also, I would -- should call the Court's attention to the fact that the Hunt case was left up in the air by a subsequent decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.451" offset="2397727">In the case of Aetna Life Insurance Company versus Moses which was at 1933, there was a question about whether or not the carrier could join the administratrix of an injured employee of his estate in a suit against the third party and the Court said it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.384" offset="2489469">Now, in the opinion by Chief Justice Stone, one of the remarks that was made was, nor do we consider what would be the rights of the person entitled to compensation or the personal representative compare Hunt versus Bank Line or the insurer in a case where the employer refused to cooperate in the prosecution of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.050" offset="2584137">So that, so far as I can find, and as I read the cases, in the last opinion of this Court on the subject, the question was left open and Hunt Line versus -- Hunt versus Bank Line was left up in the air neither approved or disapproved.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.943" offset="2651742">So that, I think, it's fair to say that so far as this Court is concerned, the question is still an open one.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.822" offset="2707226">Now, there's one other point that I'd like to take up and that is the question of what is an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.893" offset="2739513">In 1938, the Act was amended to provide that you -- that it was required that there be an award by a Deputy Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.785" offset="2771069">Now, any -- the -- the cases have said, any informal memorandum by claims examiner or etcetera is not such an award as to operate as an assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.558" offset="2810149">Now, in this case, the intent apparently was to enter an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.049" offset="2828121">We can gather that from the proceedings that went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.111" offset="2840346">The employee wanted to force the man to take whatever money he was entitled to under an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.295" offset="2865110">Now, the argument that I've made up to now has been based on the assumption that there was an award and that the Court, under its acquittal powers, would interfere to protect the man even though there was an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.169" offset="2908578">I now come to the question, was there an award within the meaning of this assignment provision?</text>
            <text syncTime="734.148" offset="2936581">Now, the only proceeding that I can find, which is described in the Act, which terminates in an award, is contained in Section 919.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.977" offset="3019860">And there is a -- a -- a whole procedure set forth and there's only one part of the procedure set forth that was not complied with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.556" offset="3058207">And the question is, isn't the award which would be effective, the -- only the award that would be made pursuant to this particular section, and I think it would, and is the defect of such quality as to vitiate or negated this award being such an award as to operate as an assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.684" offset="3138664">Now, the Commissioner, the provisions here are for the Commissioner to give notice to the employer of the claim being made, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.061" offset="3176176">And then, in paragraph C, the last sentence, after it says that the Commissioner can order a hearing, he says," If no hearing is ordered within 20 days after notice has given, as provided in subdivision (b), the Deputy Commissioner shall, by order, reject the claim or make an award."</text>
            <text syncTime="813.192" offset="3252767">Now, the award was entered the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.951" offset="3263739">There was no time for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.854" offset="3271367">Now if the purpose or one of the purposes for the amendment requiring an award as to give the man a chance to think, then, this becomes an important provision for the purpose of assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.936" offset="3319641">If that is just a directory provision, then, of course, it's immaterial and the award is good.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.958" offset="3351824">Now, respondents in their briefs have raised the question that we are making the collateral attack on the determination of the Deputy Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.142" offset="3388500">We're not making a -- a collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.337" offset="3397277">So far as his order is concerned, and insofar as it purports to do what it did, it was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.481" offset="3417861">We -- we don't question.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.294" offset="3425176">The -- the only question we raise is, is it such an award as operates to make an assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.853" offset="3451402">That would have to be determined in the lower court or in the court of admiralty because they are now raising the question of assignment as a matter of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.328" offset="3493303">And we are saying that there was no such award as to operate as an assignment so that the question now must be determined on the admiralty side, on the legal side.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.030" offset="3532069">And there's no basis for us, there was no basis for us to go back and to attempt to have the wording change on the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.652" offset="3562580">The question of characterizing this document is something that should -- that has to be determined on this side of defense, not on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.014" offset="3592046">So, we feel that we are not making any collateral attack on this order or award.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.574" offset="3642201">On the question of -- of laches, I think I could limit my argument basically to this one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.211" offset="3664771">This Court has said, again, and again, and again that the question of laches is a question for the trial court after all the facts are entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.567" offset="3702178">The trial court deliberately here did not pass on the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.199" offset="5952784">It is true as Mr. Chazen states that there was no evidence by the defendant on the part of laches and there was no evidence put in by the plaintiff, by the libelant, rather, to explain his delay of seven years in filing a libel and no evidence as to extenuating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.879" offset="6043481">Our pleadings plead the defense of laches and our Kerr exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.534" offset="6074096">Judge Sugarman did not pass on the issue merely decided the assignment was valid, libelant was the wrong party to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.394" offset="6105548">Our exceptions on behalf of the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission referred to the Kerr opinion, and we annexed as part of the exceptive allegations to our pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.178" offset="6164689">Despite this fact, laches wasn't mentioned by Judge Ryan on the appeal, the Court of Appeals and we brief the question of the assignment primarily on the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.980" offset="6207843">The Court of Appeals decided the case on the question of laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.551" offset="6238145">Now, our view on laches, the Norwegian Government is this, since the District Court decided the libelant was -- did not have the power to sue, having assigned this cause of action, anything he did, without having a cause of action, can't help him or hurt him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.411" offset="6337620">If it should be found that he is the proper party libelant, then in our answer, we would plea laches, we would state that the New York statute of limitation should be applied by analogy, absent to any extenuating circumstances and after aid is three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.764" offset="6426958">But we don't really see how it makes much difference on the laches issue now because, Mr. Justice, if I sue without any right to sue for pledges of Czaplicki's injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.977" offset="6471889">Whatever I did could have no effect on his rights and whatever he did could have no effect on the rights to recover which are base that we claim in Hamilton Marine due to the effective award.</text>

            <text syncTime="1788.538" offset="7154103">But our problem is this, upon the record, it appears that Mr. Czaplicki was injured earlier in September and an award by a Deputy Commissioner was entered late in that month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.514" offset="7218051">Under the terms of the Act, he had 30 days from that period within which to sue the Deputy Commissioner to enjoin the enforcement of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.065" offset="7272176">He apparently did not, although, that was explained to him by a letter sent by the compensation authorities through him which is -- was in evidence before Judge Sugarman when we subpoenaed the entire file in support of our motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.226" offset="7336856">Then after that and the real nub of this case as it's shown by his -- the libelant's affidavit in our position to our motion on behalf of Kerr, he did not recover as quickly as he thought he would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.752" offset="7394952">He had accepted compensation believing he had a minor injury and he had underwent an operation in August of 1946, which he attributes to the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.665" offset="7454616">Meanwhile, in April of 1946, the libelant had consulted an attorney who had started suit in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.753" offset="7506965">The libelant's affidavit, however, while he attributed the operation in this consequent disability to the accident, did not have annexed any medical certificates or any doctors affidavit, nor did the doctors submit his bill to the compensation people the way he was authorized to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.473" offset="7609887">And under the Act, the libelant, with his attorney, had one year from the final payment of compensation or well, oh -- after this time of the operation to reopen this compensation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.409" offset="7673626">Had he done that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.973" offset="7683866">Then if he decided finally not to take compensation or suit, he could have opposed the issuance of an award of the -- or if the award was modified within a year, he could then sue within 30 days claiming the conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.463" offset="7785848">Our position on the conflict of interest is that there is no proof or fraud in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.470" offset="7825868">That question came up three times, came up before Judge Goddard in the Hamilton motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.452" offset="7853767">It came up before Judge Ryan in both cases at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.303" offset="7869127">Libelant's counsel said he did not wish to allege and not -- did not wish to attempt to prove fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.944" offset="7895771">And that statement is also included in the Court of Appeals introduction on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.376" offset="7929417">We, and the Norwegian Government, would not definitely not be interested in being involved in any sort of a fraud proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.212" offset="7972780">We did look into the matter as best that we could check the record and there is no proof whatsoever in the record or in all the papers we could dig out that at the time the award was made, and at the time libelant was discussing his case with the insurance company that anybody in the New York office of the insurance company knew of any conflict of interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2141.029" offset="8564088">On that point, the Royal Norwegian government had its situation arise involving a compensation act passed in 1927 with no provision for conflict of interest in connection with the assignment of third party rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.646" offset="8626573">In 1929, the case came up for the first time in Hunt against Bank Line which it was decided that even though there is a conflict of interests, the employer and his underwriter had no obligation to bring suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.694" offset="8690730">The Act was then amended and especially Section 33, providing for assignments, was amended in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.492" offset="8725943">Yet this decision of Hunt and Bank Line, another decision stemming from it were in no way taken into account in the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.087" offset="8764291">The amendments of 1938, provided only that the injured man, instead of assigning his rights upon the acceptance of compensation, did not assign any rights and the employer did not have any right to bring a suit until an award had been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.065" offset="8836180">They made the award the criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.338" offset="8845270">They didn't make absence of conflict to enter strict criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.866" offset="8863451">Now, as I gathered from Mr. Chazen's argument, he is seeking to have this Court amend the statute by judicial process to make conflict of interest, another criteria in the assignment of rights of the person injured from his title to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.082" offset="8948297">It's a little difficult for the Royal Norwegian Government to see how it -- an Act could be amended nunc pro tunc to go back to 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.518" offset="8998034">We state the matter should be decided by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.461" offset="9013812">And, in fact, the Bill has been introduced in this session of the House to cover this particular point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2496.240" offset="9984940">I understood and I don't know that and I think that gets to Justice Harlan's original -- one of his questions earlier and our liability there, of course, would be limited by the -- to the extent of our coverage under the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.116" offset="10048366">My answer to questions raised by Mr. Justice Minton, no demand of any kind was ever made in this case since so far as this record is concerned or the allegations are concerned that if ever the insurance company or the Northern Dock Company institute suit or proceed in any way against the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.774" offset="10147004">I think under the circumstances, in order to bring this case into its proper prospective as to what is -- what the facts are and also what the allegations are, I think it might be helpful if I run over the facts a little more in detail as they are disclosed by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.345" offset="10225371">As indicated, this man was injured September 6, 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.289" offset="10261107">On September 11, 1945, the Travelers Insurance Company received from the employer what is called a first notice of injury, that is the employer reports to the insurance carrier, the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.700" offset="10350759">That indicated that the injuries were rather tribunal and that they were bruises, whereupon, the record shows that on September 17, 1945, this claimant appeared in the office of the Traveler's Insurance Company in North New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.268" offset="10441038">He lived in Jersey City, made the trip down to New York and had an interview with one of the investigators of the Travelers Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.217" offset="10492865">At that time, it developed according to the record, I'm reading -- looking at page 78, that his description of the accident was that he slipped on some steps, that he was going over to get in to the catwalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.757" offset="10566949">The steps had been made by an outside contractor and were put in place by somebody, either employees of the outside contractor or members of the crew, not known.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.771" offset="10618984">The accident happened sometime between 12 o'clock and 1' clock in the Longshoremen route for lunch and neither the ship, the S.S. Silvercloud, nor the outside contractor are now as up here, so further investigation could not be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.485" offset="10685858">I think that isn't rather a significant thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.166" offset="10700591">Following that, there was a discussion about the employee or with the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.364" offset="10721384">It was developed that he owned his own home and he had a married daughter who lived on the upper floor of the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.578" offset="10750224">The employee is undecided at the present time whether to sue the third party or to accept compensation but his daughter is very much in favor of bringing suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.743" offset="10802887">Then, there was an unsigned statement attached to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.776" offset="10815007">The record then shows at that very day, following that interview, the same investigator submitted to the Compensation Commission a -- what is known as a controversion, controversion on the ground that the employee had not has yet made up his mind on what he wanted to do, whether to sue the third party or not, therefore, the cases controverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.106" offset="10920333">Now that was the procedure that was outlined by this Court, not by any regulations of the Commission but by a suggestion of this Court in the Porello case but that's the way you protect yourself, if you are an insurance company and there is a possibility of a third party claim involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.953" offset="10999745">So that was done on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.450" offset="11009776">There's no suggestion that this investigator called up Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.911" offset="11035585">The Hamilton Company incidentally is -- has offices in Brooklyn where this is the New York office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.542" offset="11066096">There's no suggestion that on that day, he called up Hamilton Marine to find out who Hamilton's coverage was and incidentally that's the first time that was ever suggested to anybody that Hamilton Marine was involved in this case because that is the original notice to the insurance company, it didn't mention Hamilton Marine when I order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.802" offset="11159197">So that I submit that it's unlikely to assume that an investigator investigating a (Inaudible) case would call up Brooklyn and I certainly think -- don't think there was any duty on his part to call up part for Connecticut, the home office and have them checked their records to determine whether or not the Hamilton Marine Insurance Company also was covered by a Travelers Insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.031" offset="11260029">I think you've got to look at these things to some extent in a practical way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.945" offset="11287719">That -- that's on September 17, 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.418" offset="11309662">The next thing that happens, Travelers does nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.823" offset="11323246">It does no coercing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.918" offset="11331605">The next thing that occurred that on September 25th, the claims examiner for the Workmen's Compensation Commission writes a letter to the claimant and said, â€œYour claim has been controverted, you -- on the ground that you don't -- you haven't made up your mind as to what you want to do with respect to compensation."</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.561" offset="11438184">That letter appears incidentally in Mr. Estabrook's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.489" offset="11465874">In that letter, the substance of Section 33 (b) of the Act is pointed out in writing to this claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.959" offset="11503804">Acceptance of such compensation honored an award and the compensation order filed by the Deputy Commissioner shall operate it as an assignment to the employer of all rights of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages against such that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.222" offset="11564826">The letter goes on, if on the other hand, you elect to sue the third party, you should file an election to sue on the enclosed form in order to protect your future interest in the event you should be unable to recover from the third party, the amount that you would be entitled to under the Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.340" offset="11637342">That letter was written obviously received by the claimant because two days later, on September 27th, he went to New York and visited the office of the Compensation Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.687" offset="11686661">There again, according to the record, -- the -- his rights, under the Act, were explained to him not by the Travelers but by a representative of the Compensation Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.191" offset="11732741">At that time, on September 27th, he said he wanted to take his compensation and he wasn't interested in any -- any third party action and he didn't want the counsel, and therefore, the following day, on September 28th, an award was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.711" offset="11806824">And you think it followed its normal cause until December 1, the -- that Travelers' doctors -- the doctors for the Compensation Commission reported that he was no longer injured, no longer disabled, and was not entitled to any further compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.695" offset="11878713">On December 5, 1945, he is notified to that effect and compensation is stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.343" offset="11909329">So, insofar as this record is concerned, there is no allegation that Travelers Insurance Company knew anything more about this case until suit was filed in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.248" offset="11964918">Certainly, there was no obligation, as I see it, on the part of the Travelers Insurance Company to find out, whether or not, this man was still injured following around the -- the next year to determine what his condition was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.981" offset="12035866">Certainly, this Court, I feel, reasonably and certainly is not going to rule the whole, that it's the duty of the Travelers Insurance Company to file suit any case involving what $160.72 in workmen's compensation and that's what's involved in this case insofar as the record shows Travelers Insurance Company had any obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.074" offset="12148193">So that's what the decision of Travelers found itself in, when in 1952, the suit is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.620" offset="12186436">Two, Travelers then, under its obligations and under its contract has to file and defend the Hamilton Marine Contractors Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.720" offset="12222798">But up to that point I can see nothing that Travelers could have or should have done with any reason to either protect itself, or to protect or do anything for this injured employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.959" offset="13011801">But the record shows nothing was been known by the claimant at that time, Hamilton Marine was not put on any notice of these injuries or the -- the fact that these injuries were, in some way, connect to with the accident or allegedly so, nor was the Travelers Insurance Company advised, in anyway, that this man was now asserting that he was injured more seriously than was originally expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.956" offset="13139801">However, the Workmen's Compensation Act takes care of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3342.541" offset="13370096">Certainly, the statute does not contemplate and Congress never intended that in a situation of that kind, Congress of an -- an insurance carrier had to file this obligation suit or else forevermore be open to a claim of fraud or constructive fraud or liability for breach of trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.336" offset="13481273">Now, my concept of this case of the lawyers that since the Hunt case, which was in 1929, two years after the statute was passed, Congress has had an opportunity to amend this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.077" offset="13544281">The English language is quite clear and this statute's about as complete, gives about as to complete an assignment as anything could give.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.120" offset="13600392">But if the Act is to be changed to cover a situation such as this, certainly, there should be congressional hearings, some limitations should be put on the trust rule if it is to be applied by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.843" offset="13663295">Certain control over the action should probably give -- be given to the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner with respect to the right to sue or the need to sue.</text>

            <text syncTime="4316.555" offset="17266207">I think that the reason for this delay to be perfectly frank was the problem that we face in the office and working out the procedure for going ahead with this thing in view of the situation that had been created.</text>

            <text syncTime="4335.790" offset="17343112">But the problem -- we live with the problem a long time before the suit had started.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.686" offset="17358681">I would like to call the Court's attention also to one other fact here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.704" offset="17382713">There were some statement about notice being given to Traveler, Traveler having consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.768" offset="17402984">At page 50 of the record, there is an affidavit by Mr. (Inaudible) who filed an affidavit on behalf of the Hamilton Marine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.451" offset="17445721">And after discussing, making allegations on behalf of Hamilton Marine, the very last paragraph, on this motion, I also appear for the Travelers Insurance Company, that was on our motion to imply with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.476" offset="17493891">The Travelers Insurance Company does not consent to be made a party for this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.822" offset="17511236">Now, that's only specific reference I can call the Court's attention to as to their refusal to precede.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.965" offset="17535791">Now, I know that there were other conversations prior thereto but there is nothing in the record, which I could call the Court's attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.462" offset="17589812">I think with that, I call the Court's attention to the matters which I thought needed correction.</text>
