            <label>Mr. Hayden C. Covington</label>
            <text syncTime="18.011" offset="71993">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.563" offset="82233">These cases involve an important question in the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.971" offset="123820">The three men had cases in the District Courts that raised one single question, namely, that of venue and jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.974" offset="175856">The question was whether or not a District Court located where a hospital is situated to which these registrants have been ordered to do civilian work as conscientious objectors by their local boards had jurisdiction or does the Constitution, that is, the amendment as well as Article III, limit the jurisdiction exclusively to the place where the local board was situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.899" offset="347533">The question involved here is one that was mentioned but left open in the case of -- decided by this Court in United States against Anderson, which is cited in both briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.700" offset="410749">The facts in these cases were, that Johnson and Sokol were indicted in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.932" offset="451709">Johnson and Sokol were charged with having failed to perform civilian work at hospitals located in the Eastern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.325" offset="505208">They were registered with draft boards in the Western District near Pittsburgh and they were charged with violating the Selective Training And Service Act, because they did not do this work as far as the indictments show.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.804" offset="583158">Stipulations were filed in the cases showing that these men registered with these boards, that they completed their administrative remedies by appealing their cases were passed by these conscientious objectors ordered to do work at these two separate hospitals in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.632" offset="678452">They went to their boards and explained to the boards that they refused to perform this work.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.841" offset="711262">Johnson filed a letter with the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.400" offset="721502">Sokol merely notified his board orally that he was not proceeding further.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.827" offset="747207">The stipulation show that neither these two men proceeded any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.563" offset="766224">They remained in the District and did not take this second step that they've been ordered to take to proceed on to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.774" offset="803004">The Patteson case comes up from Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.053" offset="820140">That it involved an Oklahoma City man charged with failing to comply with an order, issued by an Oklahoma City draft board to do work at the State Hospital located in Topeka, Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.798" offset="887118">The case started out in Kansas, Judge Mellott transferred the case down to Oklahoma City.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.165" offset="924630">Judge Wallace transferred it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.269" offset="937064">Then Judge Mellott sustained my motion to dismiss the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.237" offset="952947">The Government took an appeal to the Tenth Circuit as they did to the Third Circuit in the Pennsylvania cases after Judge Ganey sustained the motion to dismiss in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.183" offset="1000699">The Tenth Circuit ruled in my favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.504" offset="1013969">The Third Circuit ruled against us on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.115" offset="1032359">The Tenth Circuit held that the vital and crucial step in these cases was that of proceeding from the local board at Oklahoma City to the State Hospital in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.036" offset="1088052">And that the refusal to take this step and the failure to take it constituted the offense and that it was committed in the District of Oklahoma City.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.345" offset="1129326">That is, the Western District of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.277" offset="1141029">And therefore, Judge Mellott was right when he sustained the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.907" offset="1163598">The Third Circuit held that really what was involved here was the ultimate work that these men were ordered to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.630" offset="1198498">And that since this work should have been performed and was to be performed at these two hospitals in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, that the failure to do that work occurred in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania notwithstanding, the fact that these men did not leave the Western District, notwithstanding, the fact that their local board was located in the western district, notwithstanding, the fact that the order was made in the Western District, and notwithstanding, the fact that the refusal or the failure took place in the Western District.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.950" offset="1335798">Now, the thing that is crucial, which in my judgment proves the omission on the part of the Third Circuit, in seeing the real issue involved here was that they overlooked the vital fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.956" offset="1419807">And I would like to call attention of the Court to the last page of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.532" offset="1446034">And this contains a copy of one of the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.101" offset="1468395">This is the identical order that was issued to each of these men and if I may do so, I would like to have you gentlemen make a note at the bottom of that page and put 32 C.F.R.1606.51--</text>

            <text syncTime="431.773" offset="1727007">Now, what I want call you, your attention to is the fact that this order, you notice, has three commands.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.894" offset="1763474">Command number 1 is to go to the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.635" offset="1778521">Now these three commands are vital in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.603" offset="1798374">Number 1 is to come to the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.228" offset="1808823">Number 2 is to proceed from the board to the hospital.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.759" offset="1858978">I also call your attention to the warning that's in that which indicates again that there are three separate and distinct steps in three separate and distinct offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.416" offset="1909656">Number 1 says, if you don't show up at the board, you're guilty of violating the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1150.327" offset="4601208">The record 643, on page 3 of the record, we have the Sokol indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.833" offset="4643318">It says there about six lines down, "did knowingly neglect to perform a duty imposed upon him by the provisions of said Act and that he failed or report to the Philadelphia State Hospital in the Roosevelt Boulevard in South Hampton Road, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.690" offset="4714684">And then, turn to page 4 and we have the indictment in the companion case of Sokol and it says about the sixth line of from the end of the indictment, "and that he failed and refused to obey an order of the Local Board 87, New Castle, Pennsylvania directing him to report for employment at Norristown State Hospital in Norristown, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.400" offset="4813531">Now, that's the only one of these indictments which says refused to obey an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.925" offset="4831608">The other one said he failed to show up at the hospital in the Sokol case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.259" offset="4844983">Now, let's take the record in the Patteson case, may it please the Court, Tenth Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.594" offset="4870374">The indictment is on page 1 and six or seven lines up there, it says, for the said Dudley A. Patteson, ordering him to report, talks about mailing him the order to report on July 26, 1954 and that's at the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.288" offset="4949055">For a civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety, and interest and said board deemed appropriate and he, the said Dudley A.Patteson, did knowingly and willfully refuse and neglect and fail to report at the Topeka State Hospital at the time and place so designated on the said order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.749" offset="5022929">Now, that's -- that is the indictment in each of the three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.628" offset="5062426">Now, the procedure I'd like to mention now, the procedure under the selective service law, you gentlemen well know from the cases that we've had here, that the first step is registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.761" offset="5134942">The second step is filing a questionnaire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.214" offset="5148839">The third step is taking a pre-induction physical examination and comes the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.730" offset="5174857">Then there is an appeal board determination and that, of course, is followed by an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.918" offset="5199621">If the man is classified for military service, he's ordered to go to the induction station to submit to induction to the armed forces of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.155" offset="5240581">If he had been classified as a conscientious objector, he is ordered to report to the board and there proceed to the hospital as you've seen in these orders here, this ordered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.032" offset="5300036">There is one additional difference in the conscientious objector procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.347" offset="5329293">While the case is on appeal or rather after the case comes back from the appeal board after the Department of Justice procedure mentioned in Section 6 (j) is completed, it comes back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.716" offset="5370776">Then, it becomes necessary that the registrant first be given an opportunity to make a choice of the type of work he wants to take that contributes to national importance in health and welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.989" offset="5427931">Then if he doesn't do that, then the board offers him the three and he can select one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.415" offset="5453636">If they can't agree on that, then, there's a hearing after that with the State Director present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.911" offset="5475579">And if they don't agree on that, then the State Director and the board together arbitrarily or wouldn't say arbitrarily, pursuant to law, select a type of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.322" offset="5525211">And then after that selection, then this final order comes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.542" offset="5542139">And then, of course, the -- that's -- that procedure was followed in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.269" offset="5565022">That is the distinction between the procedure followed and the steps taken on a different classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.685" offset="5606713">My basic contention here is that this third order was -- is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.629" offset="5674423">The only order that is involved in these three cases is the one, number 2, proceed to the hospital and a failure and a refusal to proceed to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.783" offset="5739102">And that is the one that we must look at in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.867" offset="5771389">The Government has not really drawn a very specific indictment and gone into great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.883" offset="5799497">They didn't make any attempt to distinguish between these separate orders in this written order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.067" offset="5828232">My point is that the Sixth Amendment and since the Constitution deals with realities and not shells and shadows and allegations, the records in these cases show what the facts were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.437" offset="5885701">The facts show that these men violated order number 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.117" offset="5904405">And this violation occurred when they went to the Board and refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.335" offset="5925303">Or if they didn't show up at the board, it would be a failure to report to the board or a refusal to report to the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.399" offset="5953515">But here they came to the board and the fact that they said what they did or filed a letter is really immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.406" offset="5993535">They could have been moot, absolutely, stand moot and say nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.180" offset="6020702">And turn away and walk out after they have been given these orders to proceed and go to the hospital and that would be a failure to comply with the second order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.962" offset="6063752">Now since that -- that is the fact, how in the world can the Government come along and manufacture a violation of this third order by merely saying that he did not do the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.798" offset="6143164">It's true that he didn't do the work, but the work did not come into play until the second order has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.445" offset="6173780">I mean it has been complied with.</text>

            <text syncTime="3480.059" offset="13920235">That order really is the origin of the duties about which there's a conflict of opinion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.236" offset="13960882">I think that in the few minutes I have left, I'll just point out a --a few things about this particular order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.892" offset="14003513">It's captioned in order to report for civilian work of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.453" offset="14021799">It's sent to the registrant and was in each of these three cases at his mailing address, which might be anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.014" offset="14051997">It isn't related especially to his residence or his home or any fixed place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.518" offset="14090031">The registrant is notified of his assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.263" offset="14116989">In the session tomorrow, I'll explain a little more about the procedure surrounding that the assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.013" offset="14151993">And then, the order really breaks down into two different orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.985" offset="14183863">The first of these is your order to report the local board and the time for reporting at the local board is set forth in this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.620" offset="14234436">Now this, the registrant gets this -- this order 10 days ahead of time so he's well advised that -- of the situation when he gets this order form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.313" offset="14285218">Then you're ordered to report to the local board where you will be given instructions to proceed to the place of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.452" offset="14317714">The instructions to proceed do not mean the instructions as to how he has to make the trip, when, what mode of conveyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.264" offset="14357002">The instructions actually given these registrants when they come to the local board are instructions as to the precise time at which they're to report the place of employment and the person usually to whom they are to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.350" offset="14421368">In some instances where the -- where it --it would work a hardship on the registrant to come to the local board, in fact, in some instances the registrant is instructed to report straight to the place of employment and by mail usually those are cases where the local board is some distance removed from where the registrant happens to be at that particular time.</text>
