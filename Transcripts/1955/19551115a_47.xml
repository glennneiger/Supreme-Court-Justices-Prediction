            <text syncTime="14.705" offset="58723">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.777" offset="67082">In the 10 minutes remaining in this case, I should like to return to the broad point with which the argument of these two cases started.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.893" offset="103549">Namely, the point on which the Second, Third and Fifth Circuits have all unanimously agreed that the subpoena power under Section 235 (a) extends to investigations to determine whether revocation proceeding should be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.156" offset="184529">Now, the investigation of such cases as we point out in our brief in the Minker case has long been a familiar function of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.185" offset="236669">It was perfectly familiar to the Congress which wrote the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.981" offset="263837">That Act as the Court knows resulted from a three-year study of immigration and nationality and naturalization problems and their administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.737" offset="306887">And the functions of the service with respect to this problem of revocation were clear to all as they have been clear to all familiar with this area of the law for 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.323" offset="369267">The common commission, the President's commission on the immigration and naturalization laws in this volume whom shall we welcome going over the functions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service on page 127, listed the central functions as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.442" offset="441678">"A -- The service is concerned," the Commission said, "with the admission or exclusion of immigrants, the apprehension and removal of deportable aliens, the conduct of naturalization proceedings and the preparation of denaturalization cases.”</text>
            <text syncTime="126.928" offset="507611">This, as I say, has long been familiar to everyone that the Immigration Service conducted this kind of investigative activity with respect to possible cases of revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.563" offset="562155">Now, it's against this background, we suggest, that Section 235 (a) must be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.720" offset="586815">Section 235 (a) extends the power of subpoena for purposes of administrative investigation to any matter material and relevant to the enforcement of this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.212" offset="672810">It -- it says, "any matter" and we contend generally said, "It was not to be read anymore narrowly than it -- than it reads."</text>
            <text syncTime="178.884" offset="715442">It ought to mean "any matter."</text>
            <text syncTime="181.065" offset="724219">And what we say is that if exceptions ought to be read into that broad language, certainly, in exception ought not to cover this familiar central and important kind of function of the Immigration Service which had long been material and relevant to the enforcement of this Act.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>

            <text syncTime="204.785" offset="819096">Your argument there, is it done necessarily to say that anything that the Immigration Board wants to do has to do any duty it has to perform, any kind or character, they can summon witnesses, any witness who might know anything about what they want to investigate.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="marvin_e_frankel" startTime="226.622" stopTime="651.818">
            <label>Mr. Marvin E. Frankel</label>
            <text syncTime="226.622" offset="906449">If -- if it is fairly a matter material and relevant to the enforcement of this Act or the administration of the Service, both categories are stated in this general language.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.661" offset="954619">The subpoena power is available as it is in other areas of administrative law.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.867" offset="987429">For example, in this footnote on page 41 of our Minker brief, we cite 38 U.S.C.131.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.156" offset="1020552">Now, that says, "For the purposes of the laws administered by the Veterans Administration, the Administrator of Veterans Affairs shall have the power to subpoena witnesses.”</text>
            <text syncTime="267.146" offset="1068513">Now recently, we had two cases, one in the Fifth and one in the Eighth Circuit where the administrator undertook to use this subpoena power in connection with educational and training statutes of Congress to obtain testimony and records from schools at which veterans were taking such training.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.534" offset="1162136">Both the Fifth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit upheld the use of the subpoena power for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.447" offset="1189721">This was for the purposes of one of the laws administered by the Veterans Administration and as such, it came within this broad grant of the subpoena power.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.950" offset="1239771">Those two cases by the way are General Trade School against the United States in 212 F.2d 656, decided by the Eighth Circuit last year and Carol Vocational Institute against the United States in 211 F.2d 539 decided by the Fifth Circuit last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.117" offset="1340395">Now, what we say is that if as all three circuits have held, this kind of problem is a matter material and relevant to the enforcement of this Act that sustains the conclusion of those courts because, "As to any such matter," the statute says, "the subpoena power is available."</text>
            <text syncTime="362.117" offset="1448438">So, there's no need to look elsewhere in the Act to find a power of investigation and subpoena with respect to any such specific matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.833" offset="1495249">That power is given precisely in Section 235 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="378.654" offset="1514580">And the question is as it was considered by the three circuits, as it's been considered by the parties on both sides, is this kind of investigation such a matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.074" offset="1560242">If it is, investigation and subpoena are provided for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.720" offset="1582811">Now, nobody has suggested because I think the suggestion would be baseless that the Attorney General's regulations in 8 CFR 340.11, providing for denaturalization investigation are improper, unreasonable, unauthorized or that the similar regulations in the -- under the prior Act which provided with similar investigations were improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.485" offset="1697855">What has happened now is that the subpoena power which formerly was available only for exclusion and deportation is now available for any matter, material and relevant to the -- to the enforcement of this Act and the kind of investigation undertaken in these -- in these cases is such a matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.174" offset="1788656">Now, there remains, and I'll discuss it briefly, the question whether the person who -- whose naturalization certificate is under investigation is a witness within the meaning of 235 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="462.563" offset="1850201">And on that, we review in the briefs and I mentioned yesterday it's important to bear in mind that this is an administrative investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.243" offset="1892937">That in such an investigation, there are no parties as this Court and other courts have held for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.749" offset="1926896">The administrative agency functions in a way analogous to the grand jury and whose proceedings similarly, there are no parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.915" offset="1967647">Now, under the 1917 Act when the subpoena power was available for deportation proceedings, it was clear and it was held by the Third and Ninth Circuits and a few District Courts which considered the problem that for deportation purposes, a subpoena could be used to compel the testimony in attendance of a person whose possible deportation was being considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.005" offset="2071928">Now, when the statute has been broadened so that it covers any matter, we say there is no reason for reading the word "witnesses" more narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.271" offset="2112993">There's no reason to suppose that Congress obviously concerned with this problem of denaturalization and broadening this familiar subpoena provision would warrant the word "witnesses" read differently from the way it had been read so as to exclude the person, to paraphrase the language of this Court in the Morton Salt case, the person best able to give the information sought and possibly least anxious to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.761" offset="2246949">So, we say that on both points, the propriety of the subpoenas in these cases is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.612" offset="2282371">The propriety of Congress' power to undo fraudulent naturalization certificates has been sustained by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.736" offset="2326883">There is nothing harsh or shocking about the concomitant exercise through the executive of the power to get the facts to determine whether this should be done.Our opponents have conceded that this could be done on pretrial discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.902" offset="2399608">Congress, we think clearly authorized the performance of this function as a matter of administrative investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.526" offset="2434090">We think that this way of handling the problem is a sensible one and a fair one, always backed by the power of the courts to prevent oppression and unfairness and after all as in discovery, the courts here have the only power of compulsion to enforce these subpoenas, the high standard of proof to denaturalize, the admitted seriousness of denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.712" offset="2546834">These remain unchanged, but nobody, we think, seriously did not dodge the power of Congress to authorize such investigations and we think it is clearly done so in 235 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="1137.813" offset="4551158">The -- the very heart of the subject of the investigation for Internal Revenue purposes is whether somebody has underpaid his tax, and that is customarily an element in a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.876" offset="4607478">The person comes in, he may plead his privilege, but I have brought with me a mimeograph of the Internal Revenue Service which quite clearly shows by its restrictions on the use of this power that subpoenas are used in cases where there may be possible criminal violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1231.504" offset="4925962">In criminal prosecutions, the Government does not have available to it pretrial discovery against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.831" offset="4959295">Our opponents conceive that this way of finding the facts is available with respect to denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.042" offset="5004121">On the same way, when you subpoena in somebody for purposes of a purely criminal investigation, you trench on the area of the privilege and you may raise a question which does not arise here as to whether you would have bring him at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.689" offset="5074756">Now, I know of no case in the Immigration Service so far where there has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.983" offset="5103909">And what I say is that if you apply the plain language of 235 (a) to reach this matter, which we think is squarely within it, it's unnecessary now to decide how you would treat a matter where purely criminal investigation was being fortified by the use of the subpoena.</text>
