            <text syncTime="26.624" offset="106475">Mr. Wilmer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark Wilmer</label>
            <text syncTime="27.327" offset="109296">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.998" offset="123925">This case involves substantially three questions, two of which are of substantive law and one procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.860" offset="159347">It maybe that the Court will not find it necessary to resolve all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.832" offset="179304">The first question involves the extent of the authority of the Federal Communications Commission to monitor communications via radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.391" offset="217548">Involves the extent of their authority and the purpose for which they may monitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.479" offset="241894">The second involves the effect of the failure of an operator of a radio station to have a temporary permit, to have an operator's permit, which the Circuit Court deemed a perfunctory permit, one which issues as a matter of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.387" offset="293512">The Circuit Court of Appeals held to the effect that the failure to have such an operator's permit, freed the communication from the protection of Section 605 and that therefore the Government might employ communications intercepted while the operator's permit was not, in effect, at a federal court freely and without limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.779" offset="423079">The third question and the one which I said was procedural involves the failure, the effect of the failure of the Government to separate out from the case which it hoped to present to the Federal Court, the evidence which the Circuit Court held to have been illegally acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.132" offset="504477">In other words, there were three interceptions in this case by the Federal Communications agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.213" offset="528823">Two of those interceptions occurred during the time when the operator's permit was not in effect and the third interception occurred after the operator's permit was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.483" offset="577829">It was agreed by the United States Attorney that these three interceptions, the transcribed recordings of it were employed in soliciting witnesses, were employed before the federal grand jury which indicted and were employed and were proposed to be employed in the trial of the action in the question of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.179" offset="668630">The matter arose in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.696" offset="686707">The two defendants or the two appellants here, Robert Sugden and his wife Jean Sugden were indicted in the federal court at Phoenix from the charge of conspiracy to conceal wetbacks, to conceal immigrants illegally in the United States through the use of a radio, through installing a radio in their farm and employing the mobile units in the trucks, to warn people in the fields of the approach of the immigration officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.762" offset="806975">There were a number of overt acts charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.881" offset="819513">One of which significantly was laid on the18th of September.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.768" offset="843024">The second indictment was an indictment against Robert Sugden alone who was alleged on -- with some 17 counts of having illegally concealed wetbacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.912" offset="895582">Prior to the cases coming on for trial, we seasonably moved to suppress all of the evidence which was secured through -- at monitoring the radio station of the appellants, of the petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.483" offset="949917">The trial court held a hearing at which evidence was introduced substantially showing the following facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.238" offset="984921">The Sugdens in early spring or summer of 1953 contacted the Motorola Company which this Court, of course, knows and which everyone knows is an outstanding manufacturer of electronic and radio equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.520" offset="1050018">They were put in contact, came in contact with the representative of that company one, (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="270.023" offset="1080007">He was, to their knowledge an experienced and able person, well versed in all of the intricacies of radio installations and regulation of which these two persons knew nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.920" offset="1139670">He was called upon to install the system for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.404" offset="1157538">He did install the system which consisted of a base station in the home, in the farm home and in mobile units in the various pickup trucks which were employed by petitioners in their farming business.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.120" offset="1216470">He undertook to get within the necessary station license and did get such a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.885" offset="1239458">He also assured them that he would take care of their operator's permits and left them some forms with which to apply for those permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.999" offset="1279896">The station was installed in August and they started operating it along about that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.731" offset="1310824">The evidence showed on the preliminary hearing that on September 9, the Sugdens raid application for their operator's permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.209" offset="1356800">This was sent back to them because they failed to put a check mark on the back of the application or on one of the forms in the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.391" offset="1389505">And accordingly, they have to resend it in and the permit was issued September 17th.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.533" offset="1422106">The testimony on the hearing was to the effect from Mrs. Sugden that to her best recollection they were ceded on the 17th.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.860" offset="1459409">Mr. Stratton who was the agent of the Federal Communications Commission who did the monitoring or was in charge of it and testified -- testified that he examined the Sugden installation on the 18th of September and he did not make any statement that the operator's permit was then not in possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.491" offset="1537881">In other words, the Government for the first time in its reply brief here would raise some question as to whether or not, in fact the operator's permits were issued on the 18th but we take the position and I think justifiably so that it was in effect conceded in the District Court that the permits were issued on the 18th.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.776" offset="1627011">The fact that Stratton, the agent went over the installation, made a report and did not claim that the permits were not in hand at that time, seems to us to rather or differently justify the conclusion that they did in fact have the permits at that time.</text>

            <label>Justice Stanley Reed</label>
            <text syncTime="433.112" offset="1732441">Was this the place for him to make an answer?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_wilmer" startTime="435.660" stopTime="524.689">
            <label>Mr. Mark Wilmer</label>
            <text syncTime="435.660" offset="1742576">Mr. Sugden testified that he recalled when the station license came that there were some language with it to the effect that operator's permits had been obtained or would be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.493" offset="1801927">The testimony of Mr. Pilling who was the technician in the Sheriffs office at Yuma and who testified before the Government was simply to the effect that he told Mrs. Sugden he couldn't fill out the completion report until they got their operators permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.717" offset="1874860">Mrs. Sugden testified that she did not know they were required.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.987" offset="1891892">She testified that they relied entirely upon Mr. Bridges to advise them what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.244" offset="1912895">The testimony was clear that Mr. Bridges was there when the station was in operation and he made no effort to warn them, to advise them not to operate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.144" offset="1948526">And Mr. Pilling, the technician from the sheriff's office while he initially stated that he warned them not to operate it, he admitted on cross-examination that all he said was that he couldn't fill out the completion reports until the operator's permits had arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.163" offset="2012578">So that, I think there is no question to what the operator's permits were not in hand until the 17th.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.129" offset="2040477">I think there's also no question in the record that the Sugdens were not warned that they require this type of a permit and I think there's no question but from the record that must be concluded that their failure to get the permits had nothing to do with the claim of conspiracy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark Wilmer</label>
            <text syncTime="562.799" offset="2251128">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.586" offset="2251024">The station -- the permit for what is known as the industrial use, the application stated that it was to be used for the purpose of connection with farm pickups and in farming operations and incidentally farming plows which is rather unusual use to put a radio to.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.195" offset="2250919">In any event, it is true that the permit as issued was a limited permit and that it was intended for use in connection with the farming activities of petitioners here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="564.205" stopTime="571.153">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="564.205" offset="2256771">And that would not cover the warning of the wetback in the farming activity I think.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_wilmer" startTime="571.153" stopTime="864.779">
            <label>Mr. Mark Wilmer</label>
            <text syncTime="571.153" offset="2284565">Well, Your Honor, I can answer that best by saying that probably it had a relation to the farming activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.933" offset="2335660">But if the Government's position is correct that this radio was so used and we do not concede that for a moment but if we accept from the face of the record as we must, in this stage of the record anyway because we're here faced only with the indictment which makes the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.824" offset="2371291">The only way I can answer that would be to say that it had no legitimate employment in connection to the farming activities which undoubtedly was used in connection with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.437" offset="2417685">Now, the proof show, if I may go back for just a moment that the investigation by the Federal Communications Commission arose upon complaint by the immigration officers in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.119" offset="2476408">The immigration officers apparently complained to the Justice Department, the Justice Department in turn complained to the Federal Communications Commission and the Commission in turn sent Mr. Stratton to the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.198" offset="2528758">He testified that the cause of his coming there was a complaint of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.037" offset="2556134">So I think that we may start out with our attempt to understand this problem at least on the supposition that it was a purposeful journey which Stratton made to Yuma area for the purpose of interception.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.919" offset="2619664">He did not need to go there to see if they have their operator's permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.514" offset="2633979">That would have been shown by their own records.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.923" offset="2647667">He had no occasion to go there except because the immigration officials complained that someone was using a radio improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.601" offset="2682358">And he went there to catch him.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.105" offset="2688418">That is the substance of it and he went there to catch him by interception of the communications by radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.348" offset="2721332">The evidence is clear that he checked in when he first got there with the immigration officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.634" offset="2750485">And that he promptly as he intercepted these communications reported to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.400" offset="2773577">And that by confidential letter or by confidential cover, copies of the transcription went forward to the immigration officials promptly after the interceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.131" offset="2816522">On the fourth, he manually took down the messages as he intercepted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.066" offset="2840242">On the tenth of September, he returned with a companion and with a recording device and mechanically recorded the transcriptions which he made, and in turn turned over to the Department of Justice and to the immigration service.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.171" offset="2892591">And then again on the 18th, he returned with the companion and again transcribed the interceptions and forwarded them to the Department of Justice and to the immigration service.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.114" offset="2940447">And on the 18th, for the first time, he called on the Sugdens and went over their installation and made certain comments and left them a set of rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.882" offset="2991438">Now, if it please the Court, the -- the Government's first position is that under the Communications Act, the Government is freely permitted to monitor and hence being freely permitted to monitor, they are freely permitted if they come upon some criminal mischief have put to make use of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.768" offset="3075030">They attempt to present the case as if the sole thing involved here was a question of, can the Federal Communications Commission monitor?</text>
            <text syncTime="777.047" offset="3108153">We make no complaint -- make no claim of course if they cannot monitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.784" offset="3131037">We do make the claim that the Federal Communications Act properly read, discloses no intent on the part of Congress to give to the Federal Communications Commission the authority which they here see, which is in effect to supervise every communication by radio whatever type or kind of communication that may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.573" offset="3222256">Now it is true that this is a particular type of a license but if the right inheres in the Federal Communications Commission to check these communications, then the right inheres in them to check all of it because the act makes no distinction as to this type of a license or that type of a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.940" offset="3307729">So that initially, we are faced with the claim of the Government that it has -- of the Federal Communications Commission as asserted by the Government that it has general supervision over all communications by radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.854" offset="3367393">Now, that claim is made frankly and boldly in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.803" offset="3387141">They state that they are required because the radio spectrum is limited to in effect allocate to each user of it, to each licensee his (Inaudible) part of the time and then in addition to that they're entitled to listen in on what he says to see if he is, in fact, saying more than he should say.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.356" offset="3521411">That is correct but it is our position, Your Honor, first, that the only fair implication from the record is that they came at the solicitation of the immigration people in connection with the claim immigration violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.319" offset="3581179">Secondly, in connection with their indictment for not having operator's license, all they have to do is produce their own records.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.359" offset="3609391">All they had to do is go to the Sugden home, see the radio on operation and look at their own records and they had a case there with respect to the operator's permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.555" offset="3642201">No question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.965" offset="3651814">So that it is true that there were filed over -- rather were returned on their presently pending certain indictments for violations of Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.849" offset="3695386">But those, we respectfully submit, the record clearly says it was for side issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.550" offset="3710119">Those are incidental.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.763" offset="4006975">In their reply brief, they trace the history of monitoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.808" offset="4027141">They say that it went back to 1920 -- 1912, I believe and they bring it forward up to 1931 with the construction of a monitoring system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.631" offset="4062459">And then they say that in 1931, when this system was or this central monitoring station was built that it become firmly in trenched as a part of the Communications Regulation by the then Radio Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.736" offset="4130900">From that, we draw in the conclusion that it was then a part of the accepted practice that the Commission was to, was monitored.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.980" offset="4203833">We either have to decide that Congress didn't know what they were dong, that Congress was -- was -- saying a lot of things that were completely apart from the public interest or that the Congress didn't know that they were doing those things or didn't intend that they should continue doing them in the sense of eavesdropping and tackling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.365" offset="4457430">If the Congress at that time was cognizant of the fact that the radio monitoring services were then installed, were being constantly employed about the country and list all sorts of conversations and becoming aware of the fact of all sorts of criminal conspiracies afoot, of criminal mischief afoot, roam running, dope peddling, dope -- transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.781" offset="4559099">If they were aware of the fact that that was being done and they intended to authorize its continuance, wouldn't have been the reasonable thing that they would have also had those reports go to the law enforcement officers?</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.807" offset="4611135">If they didn't regard, if the Congress didn't regard that this monitoring was solely the physical, mechanical business of seeing a frequency -- that's a sign of seeing the power, was that a sign and so on, why then in this particular section did they not require that when they made an investigation and found some criminal activity afoot that they should bring that to the attention of the Attorney General or the proper law enforcement agencies.But they said nothing of that sort at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.317" offset="4713221">If we go on through the Act and turn to Section 303, I believe it is, which is the -- the -- Section which deals with the power of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.025" offset="4756062">It seems to me that a -- a complete answer is found to the contention of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.028" offset="4800052">I'm not going to read the whole thing because it is too long, I'm going to turn to the section thereof -- which provides that it shall have authority to spend the license of any operator upon proofs sufficient to satisfy the Commission that the licensee then they set out certain infractions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.801" offset="4875180">A, has violated any provision of any act, treaty or convention binding on the United States which the United States, which the Commission has authorized to administer or any regulation made by the Commission under any such act, treaty or convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.022" offset="4944039">Now mind you, if it pleases the Court, the Congress here limited solely the authority of the Commission to suspend or revoke a license where the Act violated was one which the Commission was in -- was authorized to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.943" offset="5011749">If it had been the intent of the Congress that the Commission in this general monitoring practice which they say was so firmly and established, if it had been the intent of the Congress that it was the power, the right of the Commission to listen generally on all conversations and having this been -- and having intercepted then to transmit the information and use it in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.785" offset="5091056">Why did the Congress here say you can only suspend a license where the Act violated is one “any -- a violation of any act, treaty or convention binding on the United States which the Commission is authorized to administer”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.291" offset="5157094">Clearly there, the Congress had intended that the Federal Communications Commission was to become a super detective agency insofar as radio is concerned, would they not have authorized them to suspend the license, license of any station which was used in an illegal operation?</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.610" offset="5362416">I -- I'll say very frankly that that is the most troublesome question on the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.917" offset="5383628">I say that they cannot use it and I say it for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.279" offset="5409019">The Act does not contemplate that the monitoring which we're talking about here is to be that of a general listening in on conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.442" offset="5449665">The Congress gave in this authority, gave them the authority to inspect installations associated with radio stations to check the -- to see if they were properly constructed, properly operated or properly controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.870" offset="5523435">The language isn't just right, but in any words, the Congress limited their authority to inspect radio installations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.439" offset="5549662">Now the Government would take that language and blew it up into the proposition that they were entitled on the basis of that to do anything they want to insofar as radio is concerned but it is our position that when they say inspect radio installations, they could very well that they had wanted to go further and give them this general authority that we're talking, have given them the authority to inspect communications made by radio or to otherwise broaden their authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.599" offset="5658331">But it is our position, Mr. Justice Harlan, that we do not find in the words, inspect, radio installations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.765" offset="6010984">Section 605 which is the section which of course is crucial here which this Court has passed upon numerous times in connection with telephone wire tapping originally was, of course, a part of the 27 Radio Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.796" offset="6075141">It came into telephones and telegraphs from radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.183" offset="6088725">It didn't come into radio from telephones and telegraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.923" offset="6099592">This Court recognized that in one of the cases passing on that -- I forgot in which one immediately but the fact remains that at the time when 605 was carried forward by the Congress into the 1934 Act that 605 was then left in its identical language, as I understand it, or substantially so as it had been before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.789" offset="6199066">Now if we can see at that moment that the Congress knew that the monitoring practice widespread, knew that the people employing the monitoring were listening in and gathering conversations and intended that they should use those conversations in the sense of handing them on to a federal enforcement agency, they didn't indicate that in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.020" offset="6304078">The statute, as the Court well knows, forbids first interception and divulsions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.941" offset="6327693">In other words the Congress forbad not interception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.005" offset="6347964">There's no -- there's no -- nothing in 605 that says they can't intercept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.685" offset="6362697">No, but the only thing that 605 prohibits is interception and divulsions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.223" offset="6396865">Then to make doubly sure, the Congress went or the statute goes on and says that in addition to the prohibition against acceptance and divulsions, it also prohibits anyone who has obtained information that has been unlawfully intercepted from divulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.045" offset="6468127">In other words, Congress first buttoned up so to speak and forbad interception and divulsions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.907" offset="6495608">And then it took the next step which was of someone acquiring information that had been intercepted but not intercepting themselves and said, “You can't disclose that either.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2087.330" offset="8349257">The Court will undoubtedly recall the circumstances when the people in Portland, I believe it was, decided to outsmart the bookies and use the shortwave radio to get the results of the race and then they puzzled in and lay the bet with the bookies before they found out how the race should come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.849" offset="8427311">It will result to a multiple large sums of money.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.268" offset="8521038">I would feel under those circumstances that the -- the protection of 605 would not apply but I also would feel that where you have a bonafide attempt to comply with the law, where you have an actual license issued to the station, where you have the station operating on its assigned frequency and where the only thing they can complain of is the fact that because this woman didn't know any better because she relied upon the representative of a well known electrical firm because she -- in good faith, went forward and used the radio that that does not constitute the type of conduct which should -- should subject her to the loss of the protection afforded by this statute, nor does it justify an interpretation of the statute which would deny her that protection.</text>
