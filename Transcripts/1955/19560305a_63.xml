            <text syncTime="28.170" offset="112640">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.767" offset="135001">This is a tax case, New Jersey franchise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.587" offset="162273">Question presented arises, however, under the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.656" offset="190589">It's the position of the appellant that the New Jersey franchise tax here imposed was excessive to the extent that it took into its measure tax-exempt federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.019" offset="268016">Werner Machine Company, the appellant, is a New Jersey corporation doing business only in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.019" offset="324023">It complains here that in practical operation in effect, a franchise tax that it paid to the -- so-called franchise tax I might say that it paid to the State of New Jersey for the year 1952 is a tax upon tax-exempt federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.405" offset="429558">The tax here in question was for the year 1952 but it was based upon the net worth of the appellant at the end of the preceding year, December 31, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.261" offset="489012">Net worth as long been recognized by this Court as the equivalent of net assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.798" offset="531122">Now, at December 31, 1951, the appellant owned some $400,000 of federal obligations which were concededly exempt from tax by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.779" offset="623073">However, the tax imposed by the State of New Jersey measured by net assets did not afford any mechanics for excluding from the net assets or net worth of the appellant these tax-exempt federal obligations and its tax payment to the State of New Jersey was thereby increased because it owned this bond by some $320.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.419" offset="769672">The tax was paid under protest, refund was properly sought, the New Jersey Division of Tax Appeals rejected the appellant's claim that this tax was not properly due.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.595" offset="838322">It's a recurring item which might come up every year and I believe that might affect other corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.357" offset="865384">It applies -- this tax applies equally to domestic and foreign corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.963" offset="883775">There's no distinction in the statute which imposes the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.467" offset="917838">The taxing act is called the Corporation Business Tax Act of 1945, it purports to impose a franchise tax on domestic and foreign corporations for the exercise of several privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.322" offset="1017208">The taxing act is -- is quoted in the appendix to appellant's brief at page 16 and following and the initial section which is the section actually imposing the tax provide that every domestic or foreign corporation not hereinafter exempted shall pay an annual franchise tax for the year 1946 and each year thereafter as herein after provided for the privilege of having or exercising its corporate franchise in this State or for the privilege of doing business, employing or owning capital or property, or maintaining an office in this State and such franchise tax shall be in lieu of all other state, county, or local taxation upon or measured by intangible personal property used in business by corporations liable to taxation under this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.044" offset="1376131">The preceding sentence I think is of considerable significance because it imposes the tax not only for the privilege of doing business but also for the privilege of mere employing or owning property.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.274" offset="1449064">Franchise taxes customarily have been imposed only on corporations doing business, this tax goes beyond that, it poses the tax for the privilege of mere idle ownership of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.911" offset="1571631">Claiming that this is not in substance a franchise tax that in practical operation and effect, it imposes a burden on the tax-exempt bond unless hinders the borrowing power, even though it might be designated a franchise tax.Does that say that a franchise tax based on the assets of the corporation which included 50% of government bonds that they could not be accommodated?</text>

            <text syncTime="461.220" offset="1844872">Now, I don't think that a tax imposed on the privilege of owning property, idle ownerships is any different than the -- than a property tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.029" offset="2020101">The history of the Act indicates that this is in lieu of property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.382" offset="2041522">But it's the contention of the appellant here that not only in -- in lieu of a property tax, in fact it is a property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.227" offset="2072869">And secondly, even if it -- that it doesn't -- it isn't material whether we call it a franchise tax or a property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.486" offset="2101917">But under the New Jersey Realty decision of this Court in 1950, if in practical operation and effect it burdens the bonds, then it must -- then it's bad.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.335" offset="2321241">In that case there was a minimum -- a minimum requirement apart from the net worth proposition, was there not, said in -- in any event it cannot be less than 15% and thereby necessarily caught government bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.033" offset="2376098">There's nothing like that here, isn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Goodwin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="595.371" offset="2381427">Yes, there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.466" offset="2385816">Interestingly enough, a precise situation is here, although it wasn't here in 1945 when the Act was originally enacted but it came into the Act about 2 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.709" offset="2438792">A survey was made and it was ascertained that certain property within the State was escaping -- was not bearing its fair share of the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.406" offset="2473587">And therefore an alternative was added and that was designed to catch corporations with very substantial assets and not much taxable net worth and that alternative tax is based -- well there's two alternatives, one is important in large corporations, one, it's smaller, both those in (Inaudible) the alternatives are based upon assets and not net worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.410" offset="2561567">Now, the only difference and I think it -- it isn't a difference, I think it's a rearrangement between the New Jersey Realty situation and the one here is that the alternatives are in reverse order.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.296" offset="2613081">In New Jersey Realty, there was a tax on property and there wasn't any taxable property, then an alternative tax is not less than 15% of net worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.227" offset="2660833">Here, there's a tax on net worth and the net worth doesn't bring down much tax than an alternative tax at a much lower rate on gross assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.146" offset="2704509">And in both cases, the case here and the New Jersey Realty case, the higher of the two taxes was properly due and owing.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.487" offset="2737946">And I don't think that the order in which the computation is made is significant at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.419" offset="3173669">It's never -- there's never been a decision upholding any such distinction in a case of tax-exempt federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.576" offset="3210240">Most of the decisions along that line were interstate commerce cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.877" offset="3227481">Now, the interstate commerce cases I think are different because this Court has held that no unreasonable burden can be placed upon the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.642" offset="3270531">Here, we have a constitution and revised statute Section 3701, which I haven't mentioned specifically yet, which say no burden at all can be imposed upon the tax-exempt obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.992" offset="3323925">Any burden at all that hinders the borrowing power is -- is invalid, it causes the tax to be stricken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.851" offset="3371363">Now, New Jersey Realty said that we'll look through the label that's put on the tax, that it matters not whether we call it a property tax or a franchise tax, that the question that must be decided by this Court is whether in practical operation and effect it imposes a burden on the tax-exempt federal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.746" offset="3490900">This particular tax, the business corporation tax of 1945 has an interesting historical background.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.320" offset="3525277">Before 1946, New Jersey collected most of its income on a property tax base, the tax applying to real property and to intangible or rather personal property and including intangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.239" offset="3596852">There was also a capital stock tax imposed upon corporations but it was measured by the number of shares of power or nominal value of outstanding stock and it was not the type of tax we now have.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.562" offset="3658188">In other words, it -- it bid upon the capital structure rather than -- than on the size of the net worth or assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.177" offset="3696640">In 1944, New Jersey legislature appointed a commission, the commission for the taxation of intangible personal property, and it's function was to examine into the difficulties and I believe inequities which were arising under the then existing system, taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.143" offset="3804473">The joint resolution appointing the committee as paragraph number one indicates, be it resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey, there is hereby created a commission to investigate the question of evaluation and taxation of intangible personal property and related tax subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.496" offset="3905933">Interestingly enough, the -- that commission came up with the recommendation for a franchise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.785" offset="3943131">It -- the report -- I understand that there will be copies, sufficient copies of its complete report for the members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.826" offset="3975210">We quoted part of it in our appendix to the reply brief but it analyzed the then difficulties with the intangible personal property tax in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.081" offset="4028291">Corporations then doing business in New Jersey were subject to a risk or hazard which was called tax lightning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.638" offset="4066534">Basically, the law then provided that intangibles were subject to tax at their full value at the same rates as real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.646" offset="4114495">In actual practice, corporations were not paying the full tax on all intangible personal property owned by long custom, the tax was imposed only on certain limited classes of intangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.925" offset="4183667">But occasionally, local taxing authorities would come into the office of a corporation, value the intangible personal property and demand the full tax which was -- imposed a very high burden and not -- did not operate fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.799" offset="4255138">As a result, a great many holding companies and other large corporations settled in one community, Flemington, where administration of the tax promised to be fair and just and the large assembly of corporations with the vast amounts of personal property held kept the rate at a very low figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.094" offset="4336327">In other words, a great many of them got together in a small New Jersey community to share the burdens of that community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.345" offset="4381362">In 1945, the commission on taxation of intangible personal property submitted its report to the New Jersey legislature and it's on the basis of that report that the present -- the tax act now before this Court was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.694" offset="4490762">It's first recommendation from the conclusion of the report is as follows, commission unanimously recommends first that the present methods of taxing intangible personal property be abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.079" offset="4556278">Appellant takes the position that it's significant that there's no intent there to abandon the taxation of personal property but only the present methods of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.774" offset="4643004">The commission transmitted its report to the governor and members of the legislature with a cover letter of transmittal which summarizes the purposes and recommendations and it is significant in that -- it states what the commission believes its purpose was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.864" offset="4763376">The commission's purpose therefore has been two-fold, to remove the threat of what is commonly called tax lightning from intangible personal property and to provide a sound base through which a substantial amount of this property now legally taxable but untaxed can be reached for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.263" offset="4856999">This indicates that it was the commission's understanding that they were to come up with a new law which would reach intangible personal property for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.733" offset="4954906">In the conclusion of the report, the recommendations which the commission made to the legislature, proposal number two was adopted by the legislature and is part of the law now in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.397" offset="5029512">Proposal number two made to the commission and approved by the commission is that intangible personal property be exempted from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.745" offset="5066919">The commission, for a reason stated in the text, concludes that intangible personal property be exempted entirely from taxation under a property tax, provided that the present taxable base now threatened by tax lightning be made to bear its fair share of the cost of government in some other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.371" offset="5157407">That indicates a clear intention to reach personal property to carry its fair share of the cost of government under the amended law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.870" offset="5215399">I don't think that anyone could read the report of this commission as commission on the taxation of intangible personal property without coming to the conclusion that its purpose was to bring the New Jersey tax on intangible personal property up to date, so that the tax would reach the intangible personal property owned by corporations and that -- that all of that intangible personal property would be reported and subjected to the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.651" offset="5354580">Incidentally, this commission was -- the chairman of this commission was Professor John F. Sly of Princeton but we thought it might be unwise to refer to this report as the Sly report in fear it might -- we might be accused of impugning its motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.540" offset="5454158">The statute was enacted as recommended by this commission in 1945 effective for tax years 1946 and subsequent and it followed the commission regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.520" offset="5510060">There were two companion measures that went through it at the same time, the Corporation Business Tax Act and the repeal of the old intangible personal property tax.</text>
