            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="4.845" offset="19331">When the Court arose I was just coming to a brief discussion of the statutory provision in Section 307 (d), which directs the Commission whenever deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest to establish through route and joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.376" offset="93414">This provision which was passed in 1940 marked the culmination of a long struggle almost by Congress to obtain adequate joint rail-barge relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.243" offset="152869">The Federal Barge service began shortly after World War I, and then a series of statutes which we have traced in our brief, Congress again and again emphasized the importance of prescribing fair, through joint-barge routes and rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.455" offset="229773">As a realistic matter, it's only in a small percentage of the cases that barge transportation is meaningful just by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.392" offset="277525">Most shippers and most receivers are not both located on a waterway and the result is that the barge transportation to be effective, it is necessary that there'll be a connection, either at the beginning or the end of the water journey or in fact, at both.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.981" offset="351922">The inherent advantage of barge transportation as this Court recognized in Mechling is its cheapness.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.990" offset="379925">Now, if you have -- again, reverting to the fact of this case, if you have a cheaper route in here, this course here is $5.32 for the barge plus a $1.5 to bring it to the -- from the mine to Galveston was $6.82 as against a local railway from the mine to here of possibly $8.73.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.075" offset="504268">The saving of a $1.91, if you're just going from here to here, but if that is not passed on through a connecting rail carrier, the result is that the person who wants to get this sulphur here does not get the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.991" offset="575948">Now, when Congress passed the statute in 1940, one of the things that it was concerned with and deeply concerned was the fare expressed by the proponents of water transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.994" offset="627879">That Congress -- that the Commission might administer this Act so as to favor the rail carriers over the water carriers, and it inserted as this Court pointed out in Mechling a number of provisions designed to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.954" offset="683781">The Mechling case was concerned with an attempt by the railroads to favor railroads over barge transportation through the device of raising the rates on the traffic which had been moved in by barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.879" offset="739474">In the Mechling case, this Court struck down a Commission order which had approved a rate under which the railroads attempted to charge more for grain moving from Chicago to the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.713" offset="790779">If it arrived in Chicago by barge, then it arrives in rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.019" offset="811990">And in condemning that rate structure, this Court repeatedly pointed out that Congress permitted the Commission no way in which it could approve any rate system which failed to pass on to people who ship by barge the inherent advantage of barge transportation, namely, its lower cost and it relied primarily on the statement in the National Transportation policy that the Commission in administering the Act was to make sure that it would recognize and preserve the inherent advantages of each form of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.053" offset="964127">Now, Congress, when it passed the 1940 Act, also recognized there was another way in which the inherent advantage of barge transportation could be denied to shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.199" offset="1012715">Instead of the railroads increasing the rail-barge rate, and therefore, wiping out the lower cost of barge transportation, the railroads could reduce their own rates to the level of the barge rates and that would have the same effect and we've set forth in our brief colloquy on the floor of the Senate in which that very question was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.804" offset="1099128">It was pointed out, “Yes, that is prohibited by the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="278.558" offset="1114175">Now, in view of the fact that effective utilization of barge transportation requires that there'll be fair arrangements between the barges and the rail carriers to pass on to the shippers the inherent advantage of the barge transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.379" offset="1181466">The failure of the railroads to establish through routes and joint rates with a connecting barge line, while at the same time, maintaining such a relationship with a connecting rail rate in a very serious sense denies to those who would ship by barge the inherent advantages of the barge transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.189" offset="1284702">In the Mechling case, I'd like to quote briefly, “The Court pointed out at page 579 that it was not within the province of the Commission to adjust rates, elimination, to protect the traffic of railroads from barge competition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="341.884" offset="1367458">We think realistically in this case that is what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.529" offset="1386057">The only carrier that was before this Court and the only defendant railroad before the Commission were these railroads here, not any of these railroads going from East St.Louis to the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.591" offset="1442273">These railroads up here, the ones who were receiving the barge track have refused to establish the joint rates for the rail carriers on the ostensible ground that if they don't want to get less than $2.95 from a barge traffic moving along here.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.244" offset="1516878">Well, the first and obvious answer to that is they're not getting anything on the barge traffic now because no barge traffic is moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.782" offset="1543105">The Commission found that since 1950, all of the traffic from the Galveston Mines to Danville has moved by rail, and of course, that isn't at all surprising because I seriously doubt that any sane businessmen would want to pay 60 cents more for inferior transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.413" offset="1617607">The Commission now suggests in its brief that there was another ground upon which this description of through joint rates is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.852" offset="1651357">It says at page 50, “The Commission was not required to support the railroad to give up their long haul of a thousand mile and merely taking an exchange this short 186-mile for -- from East St.Louis to Danville.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="430.243" offset="1720947">Who -- who says that, the Commission?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="431.685" stopTime="625.823">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="431.685" offset="1726694">The Commission says that in its brief now.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.098" offset="1736307">And our answer to that is, that the only question here is whether this railroad, the railroads from East St.Louis to Danville are required to treat the barges at least the same way as they treat the connecting railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.959" offset="1791791">And the fact that they apparently wish to protect these railroads from barge competition is not a proper ventures upon which the Commission refuses to prescribe the through joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.665" offset="1850619">The Commission also suggests in its brief that the barge route is circuitous, much longer than the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.253" offset="1892937">Therefore, they say now, “It was not required -- that the Commission is not required to find a description of rail barge rates within the through rates within the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.084" offset="1932330">The short answer to that we think is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.477" offset="1941838">First, the Commission did not rely on that, they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.880" offset="1951451">The second and more important, the lower barge cost, the total of $9.77 as against the old rail combination rate of $11.66 was achieved despite the fact that the barge traffic is more -- a more cumbersome route.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.279" offset="2025012">And of course, one of the things about the barge is it's slower.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.573" offset="2038282">The barges themselves move slower and the river twists and turns, it doesn't go straight the way a railroad track does.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.669" offset="2062629">But the fact is that the barges are able to operate this route at $5.32.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.648" offset="2090527">They should be permitted to pass on to shippers the same benefits that the connecting rail -- the railroad got here give to their connecting rail carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.980" offset="2171820">We thus think that under the facts of this case where you have a situation that absent joint all-rail rates, the rail barge cost to the shipper would be substantially cheaper than the all-rail rate and whereas the result of a joint all-rail rate, the barge service which is inherently cheaper now costs 60 cents more than the past rail service that the Commission was inquired upon that it was necessary or desirable in the public interest in order to preserve the inherent advantages of the barge transportation to establish through barge routes and joints rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.939" offset="2351752">We also think that the same result follows under Section 3 (4), which prohibits a discrimination by carriers between connecting lines including water carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.109" offset="2412356">And we think that there's a discrimination prohibited by this section on a rail carrier, establishes a through route and joint rate with one of the connecting rail carriers and at the same time refuses to establish such a through route and joint rate with a connecting barge line which in turn competes with the connecting rail carrier.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="650.708" offset="2602736">The -- Section 3 (4) is basically designed, we think, to prohibit a carrier from favoring one of two connecting carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.253" offset="2648921">Now, the Commission repeatedly has held that if a rail carrier has two connecting water carriers, it's a discrimination prohibited by 3 (4) for it to establish through routes and joint rates with one of the water carriers and not with one of the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.178" offset="2716630">Similarly, it is held that where there are two connecting rail carriers, it's discriminatory to establish through routes and joint rates with one and not to establish it with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.377" offset="2757486">We don't think it makes any difference here that one of the connecting carriers involved is a water carrier and the other one is a rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.032" offset="2788101">The statute speaks in terms of connecting carriers, it doesn't say discriminate between connecting carriers of the same type or prohibit discrimination between all connecting carriers, and we think that whether there are two connecting carriers, which are competing with each other for the business of the shipper, the railroad is required to treat them alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.612" offset="2870439">Of course, that's all that the barges are seeking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.165" offset="2880575">All they're seeking is an opportunity to compete with the rails for the shippers' business on the same term.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.723" offset="2906802">They proposed, if they will give these railroads joining East St.Louis to Danville the same amount as they receive from the rail carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.429" offset="2941701">It is supposed that it is probably $2.26 because that is what they receive from Port Sulphur and we think it's quite significant that when there are two sources of sulphur, the rail carriers are willing to make an arrangement with this group and unwilling to make an arrangement with this group.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.910" offset="3015576">Now, the way we reach the conclusion under 307 (d) that the Commission was required to establish these rates in order to cure the discrimination under Section 3 (4) is that since it was a discrimination under 3 (4) and is illegal under 3 (4), it is plainly necessary or desirable in the public interest for the Commission to prescribe through routes and joint rates to cure that discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.836" offset="3155278">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.101" offset="3172310">I would like to state at the outset that the statement to which counsel has just referred in the Commission's brief from page 18 which had indicate that the Commission is basing its decision on the short holding provision of the Section 15 (4) is an inadvertence and the Commission does not rely upon the short holding or circuitous routing of this traffic at all in reaching its decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.146" offset="3280562">As a matter of fact, when the barge lines filed a petition with the Commission for reconsideration of Division 3's action which found that there was no discrimination under Section 3 (4), and therefore, and that there have been no showing of any evidence that the barge lines -- that there should be through routes and joint rates established between the barge lines and the railroads in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.625" offset="3390485">And so, the barge lines in asking the Commission -- for Commission to reconsider the action of Division 5, asked that the only -- ask that only with respect to Section 3 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="860.684" offset="3442730">And the entire Commission only considered the petition for reconsideration under Section 3 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="866.391" offset="3465509">And on the -- when this case was brought into the District Court by the barge lines, the barge lines only asked for a review of the Commission's order under Section 3 (4) and nothing else and the -- and the case was considered by the District Court under 3 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="880.837" offset="3523291">And on -- in the jurisdictional statement of the barge lines here, the only alleged discrimination is under Section 3 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="888.816" offset="3555161">The Department of Justice's brief, the Department of -- rather, the United State -- brief of the United States discusses the Section 307 (d) issue and that is not even involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.769" offset="3611063">It was not raised in the jurisdictional statement and the United States haven't filed no jurisdictional statement, but merely filed a motion, it's the first time it has got in the case at all, were filing a motion or rather a brief in opposition to the Commission's motion to affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.969" offset="3659860">Therefore, the -- it would not be having the standing to raise the question of the Section 307 (d) matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.456" offset="3685773">But that -- that's beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.988" offset="3691938">The main thing that I wanted to get to talk about now is the question of division, which counsel for the barge lines discussed in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.023" offset="3744078">And he made one -- counsel made one statement that deserves some attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.711" offset="3766753">He said, “That services from East St.Louis to Danville, over the rail route was identical on X barge as an X rail track.”</text>
            <text syncTime="957.968" offset="3831850">Now, there is not a scintilla of evidence in the record that would support that statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.773" offset="5619043">And the Court said that in that case, that divisions are and I quote, "A matter of bargain and maybe fixed at in an -- in an arbitrary amount, and sometimes one carrier is allowed the full local rate while the rate of another is seriously reduced, and that the basis of such divisions differ greatly in practice."</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.008" offset="5723951">Now, divisions, therefore, between carriers, reflect bargaining and -- and strategic position of carriers participating in joint rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.140" offset="5872536">The barge line factor for the transportation from New Orleans or Port Sulphur to East St.Louis is $4.20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.856" offset="5923422">The -- the rail carriers, the total through rate I believe is $6.66 on which the barge factor is only $4.20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.519" offset="5958008">And the railroads accept as a division in lieu of the $2.95 rate, $2.26, a 100 pounds for each share of the transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.762" offset="6007014">Now, with respect to that sulphur, the -- the sulphur originates with the barge lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.621" offset="6038465">It's brought in by some private, little tramcars or something owned by the producers and it moved a few hundred yards or whatever the distance is, up to the barges and they load it in to the barge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.024" offset="12236069">Danville would simply take the same rate because it's intermediate on the lines of these carriers operating between the St.Louis and Joliet.</text>

            <text syncTime="3074.141" offset="12296464">While Mr. Howell has discussed the overall aspects of the case on behalf of the Commission, I should like to make my argument a bit more personal on behalf of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.238" offset="12340872">In December of 1949, these barge lines approached the railroads with one proposal, a through route, a joint rate of $7.67, a division to them of $5.41, and the balance of $2.26 to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.824" offset="12415269">Now, please note that their local rate at that time was $5.32, so their great contribution to this competitive effort is to take 9 cents more as their requested division of the joint rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.855" offset="12495412">So that any advantage, which is going to accrue to a shipper or consignee is going to accrue from the railroads, not from any action of the barge lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.100" offset="12552359">We turned that proposal down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.503" offset="12561972">It was not recommended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.216" offset="12572839">And we would not recommend their proposal from any barge line or any railroad on that basis, because, as I think one of the justices pointed out, joint rates are ordinary less than the combination of locals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.061" offset="12644206">So, it means that your division would ordinarily be less all things considered equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.466" offset="12681822">But what the appellants expect you to do here is to write divisions into Section 3 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.937" offset="12715677">They wish to make a comparison between a division, which is dealt elsewhere within the Act and a rate or a charge which the Congress deals with under Section 3 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.428" offset="12781610">They admit that those two things are not comparable when a shipper comes before the Commission or before the Court, but they overlooked the point that the reason they're not comparable is because they are unlike things in their very establishment under the law that Congress has dealt differently with both of them in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.130" offset="12884428">They are inherently different, and thus, it is the comparison itself which is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.026" offset="12916088">And if the comparison is invalid, it is not -- it does not depend on who makes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.685" offset="12946704">A division is specifically dealt with in Section 15 (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.411" offset="12965616">At other points throughout the Act, the Congress has taken care to -- to say divisions when they mean divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.100" offset="13000307">And you will find differences reflected throughout the Act such as in Section 1 (4) where the railroads are required to maintain just and reasonable rates, but just reasonable, and equitable divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.029" offset="13060075">And nowhere in the Act will you find the term “equitable” used in connection with the rate, a fare, or a charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.607" offset="13522338">At the time of this proposal, as were shown by a movement study in the past six months of 1950, the last six months of the 1950, the record shows that the contract carrier, barge, was moving this traffic at a rate of $4.65 per gross ton, 67 cents a ton under the local rate maintained by these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.950" offset="13639784">It was not moving all-rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.253" offset="13648980">They could not conceivably, honestly, and justly blame the all-rail railroad rate for their failure to share in the tonnage, because the barge carrier contract rate of $4.65 obviously provided a much more economic method of transportation to the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.776" offset="13739050">Now, when they see that that barge, that contract carrier barge is moving this at $4.65, they have two choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.913" offset="13783562">The first is obvious, reduce our rate and make ourselves competitive on the barge leg of the haul.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.201" offset="13820761">The second is a little more obscure and it takes a little ingenuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.270" offset="13849078">If we can sell the railroads, the idea of a joint rate, through route, and get at least as much as we now get for our local rate, then we can get the sulphur to the Danville consignee at the same amount with very little difference, if any, as that Danville consignee can now get it by contract carrier barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.401" offset="13993587">And so, they come to the Commission in the guise of public interest and necessity, seeking through routes and joint rates, if you please, contending that the railroads are keeping them out of this traffic, and all they're going to do is get the sulphur to the Danville consignee at the same cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.774" offset="14083030">The only difference is that if they can get that joint rate in the public interest, that joint rate will be available only to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.975" offset="14123886">And the contract carrier with whom we do not and are not required to join the joint rates, will still have the application of the $2.95 local rate, plus his $4.65.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.900" offset="14175504">So, they get themselves into the position where they can compete, but at the same time for that barge leg of the haul, these very generous people who tell you they only want equality of treatment, are not going to give any of that decreased cost to the shipper or to the consignee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.795" offset="14267141">They're giving him nothing he doesn't have at the time, and that's why no shipper or consignee appear if they were giving them some advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.688" offset="14314684">In my very brief experience with the railroads and before the Commission, I have never noticed the reluctance on the part of any shipper to appear and tell the railroads he wanted something, but he wasn't getting any advantage here.</text>
