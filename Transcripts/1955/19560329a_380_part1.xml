            <label>Mr. Samuel M. Sprafkin</label>
            <text syncTime="35.812" offset="143151">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.195" offset="152764">This case which his here on appeal from the Court of Appeals of the State of New York involves the protection to be accorded a known incompetent person so that she may not be deprived of her property, for the failure to pay taxes, the amount of which is but a small portion of the value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.041" offset="256104">But the facts in this case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.348" offset="277316">Briefly, they are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.327" offset="289228">One, Nora Brainard was a resident and is a resident of the State of New York in the Town of Somers which is in Westchester County.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.694" offset="334681">She had been a resident there for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.416" offset="349623">She lived in a one family residence dwelling owned by herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.873" offset="371461">She was also a person of means in that she owned property, income producing improved real property, four other parcels in addition to the house in which she lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.369" offset="433424">She had been and was incompetent for a period of 15 years prior to the institution of the instant foreclosure proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.968" offset="467801">She was known to the citizens, to the neighbors, to the officials of the town to be incompetent, to be incapable of handling her affairs and to understand the nature of any papers, documents of notices that may be served upon her.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.354" offset="533316">With the situation such as this, Nora Brainard, not having paid the taxes on her own personal residence for a period of four years, the Town of Somers invoked a comparatively new statute in the laws of the State of New York known as the in rem foreclosure statute and listed her property along with a number of other properties on a list of delinquent tax properties.That list was filed in the county clerk's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.048" offset="656091">Her name appeared as the apparent owner, the description of the property and the amount of taxes due.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.411" offset="685558">Under the in rem statute of the State of New York, that constituted in effect similar to the filing of a complaint, also similar to the filing of a lis pendens or a notice of a pendency of an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.306" offset="737176">Then, in accordance with the statute, the town attorney published notice of the institution of the proceeding in two newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.695" offset="778762">And the notice in effect stated in view of the owners of the properties listed on this delinquent list on file in the county clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.141" offset="820558">If you do not redeem your property within seven weeks or if at the end of the seven weeks, you do not put in an answer, in effect, stating that you don't owe the money, then your property will be taken from you and it will be deeded to the Town of Somers.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.150" offset="904568">Publication was had.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.306" offset="909166">There was no dispute in this matter that publication was had.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.316" offset="925257">Also, in accordance with the statute, a notice was posted in the proper public place such as the post office.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.240" offset="952947">Also in accordance with the statute, this notice was mailed to Nora Brainard at her residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.901" offset="983562">Nora Brainard, of course, did not redeem the property within the seven weeks from the date of first publication, nor did she put in an answer because Nora Brainard was incapable of understanding these papers that had been sent to her and was so known by the town to be incapable of doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.567" offset="1074260">Now, the institution of these proceedings started sometime in may of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.453" offset="1097770">In September of 1952, the period having expired, the seven-week period in addition to that, the twenty-day period, the town obtained a judgment from the County Court where these proceedings were instituted foreclosing Nora Brainard of all right title and interest and into this property upon which she resided.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.397" offset="1185541">And in accordance with the judgment to foreclosure in that case, which the record of deeds was to be delivered to the town, the town had received the deed to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.161" offset="1232562">The town, then, on October 24th, became the absolute owner of this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.127" offset="1256490">Five days later, in another proceeding to wit, on October 25th, apparently in recognition of the fact that Nora Brainard was incompetent and of unsound mind, through all this period of time, the County Court in this other proceeding certified and adjudicated Nora Brainard as a person of unsound mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.135" offset="1344470">And in that other proceeding, as a result of that certification, one week later, she was committed to a state mental institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.905" offset="1383549">That occurred on November 6.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.892" offset="1423464">I -- I understand that that is an ex parte party proceeding bases upon some application.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.259" offset="1448960">It does not appear in the record at all.Some two-and-a-half months later, the end of January, 1953, Mr. Covey, by order of the Court, was appointed as Committee of the person and property of Nora Brainard.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.838" offset="1511340">And in the subsequent month, he qualified as the Committee by filing the necessary oath and bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.643" offset="1538508">Now, between February, 1953 and September, 1953, about that time, the property now being in the apparent absolute ownership of the town, they attempted to dispose of it and put it up for sale at a minimum upset price of $6500.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.306" offset="1629205">On -- in September of 1953, Mr. Covey's attorney, the Committee's attorney, went to the town and said that under the circumstances of this case, I now tender to you all of the accrued taxes, all the interest and penalties, all of the charges of maintenance, all of your expenses in connection with the foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.745" offset="1714887">Take it all and give us back the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.791" offset="1723141">Give it to the Committee as the Committee of the person and property of Nora Brainard.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.352" offset="1741322">The Town of Somers refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.877" offset="1751458">Upon such refusal, the Committee went into the County Court where this proceeding had been pending, where the judgment had been entered and pursuant to which judgment indeed had been delivered.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.590" offset="1838289">And he went before the County Court and made this application to vacate the judgment and vacate the deed setting forth all of these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.488" offset="1881861">No papers in opposition, that is no affidavits putting in issue any of the facts which I have stated, were submitted by the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.849" offset="1923344">In other words, they took the position that even if all of the -- all of the facts as stated in the affidavits were taken to be so, nevertheless, you have no claim to any remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.739" offset="2010906">In other words, there were moving affidavits submitted in connection with the order to show cause which was the nature of the motion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.160" offset="2048627">In other words, this proceeding was brought on by order to show cost to set aside the judgment and to set aside the deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.479" offset="2073913">And affidavits were submitted not only by the attorney for the Committee but also by the Committee himself setting forth the facts as I have -- have stated them to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.835" offset="2111321">No affidavit in opposition was submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.458" offset="2121770">Merely, I assume a brief, a question of law -- a question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.546" offset="2142145">The County Court denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.853" offset="2163357">The County Court -- the county judge said that, “We -- I think you have chosen the wrong procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.902" offset="2203585">That you should not have moved by order to show cause or by motion in the proceeding, but you should have taken advantage of subdivision 7 of 165-h which says that, a separate and plenary action should be started within two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.913" offset="2271608">But even if you had done that, says the opinion in effect, nevertheless, because the town had complied strictly with the letter of the statute, you have nothing to complain about in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.151" offset="2332526">The Committee then appealed from that disposition from the order of the County Court to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York which affirmed but not on the opinion of the County Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.140" offset="2388532">The Appellate Division said, “Since the requirements of the statute were followed by the town verbatim, notice by publication, by mailing and posting having been complied with, regardless of the facts in this matter, this seven-week period within which to redeem was in effect the statute of limitations and you have no standing here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="624.912" offset="2499605">The matter was then taken to the New York Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.393" offset="2513502">The Court of Appeals did not render any opinion so that we do not have the benefit of its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.751" offset="2534922">It merely affirmed without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.146" offset="2544536">However, on the motion for reargument and for the amendment of the remittitur, it did indicate that it did consider the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.343" offset="2581316">In other words, it did consider the question whether Nora Brainard was deprived of her property here, under the facts and circumstances without notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.685" offset="2622694">In other words, without due process, without equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.137" offset="2672536">We -- we say that it would appear that the -- that the statute as such, since it makes provision for notice, is constitutional per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.766" offset="2710988">We do say the application by the town of the statute to the particular circumstances here were such as to deprive Nora Brainard of her property without notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.469" offset="2753829">In other words, the statute recognizes, in effect, the legislature of the State of New York, recognized that when you deprive a person of a valuable right such a right -- such as a right of redemption, such as a right to excess funds, funds' excess value, value over and above the value -- value over and above the aggregate amount of the tax liens, those are rights that may be taken from a person only upon notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.448" offset="2869708">But, in view of the fact that Nora Brainard was not only incompetent but was known to the town officials and was known to the citizens and was known to the people who had instituted this proceeding to be incapable and not only incapable to understand the nature of the notice that was sent to her but also incapable of protecting her rights, we say that the application of that statute unduly deprives her of her property.</text>
