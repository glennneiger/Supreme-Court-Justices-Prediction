            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="25.171" offset="100624">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.407" offset="113580">We seek here the review of an order of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, affirming the petitioner's conviction for contempt in the Southern District of New York, for refusing to answer second question before a federal grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.559" offset="186201">Questions as to which he said it properly and undeniably as a constitutional privilege against self incrimination of the questions which were weld by the trial court to be -- by the District Court to be answerable under the Immunity Act of 1954, which I will first describe at length to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.702" offset="266762">The Immunity Act of 1954, which appears in the appendix, is the first general immunity statute in the history of this country, notwithstanding various observations that appear on the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.470" offset="317858">It is a statute which had its origin in the attempt of certain congressional committee to secure information with respect to communism, and its principle sponsor was Senator McCarran.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.184" offset="372715">It was eventually tasked very hastefully in the closing days of the 83d Congress, and it deals not only with the congressional committee, which was the main purpose of this Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.955" offset="419736">There are also deals that subpoenas came in at the end, congressional committee from grand jury, an ancillary purpose which at this point I will make shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.868" offset="455471">This Bill provide with respect to congressional committee that in the event that the witness had set its privilege before a congressional committee and the Committee by a two-thirds vote or the House involved by a majority vote desires to compel the testimony notwithstanding the privilege, then an application could be made to a District Court for a notice to the Attorney General who can appeal and oppose or support, and the District Court will then decide whether immunity is to be given in the case of the congressional committee witness and that order will be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.610" offset="594338">If the merit is to be given, then the witness will be compelled to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.995" offset="611892">That section or those sections, (a) and (b) of the statute, I mentioned to give you the full statute, they are not before this Court directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.445" offset="641776">What is before this Court is Section (c) of the statute which reads in material language as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.699" offset="674795">Whenever in a judgment of a United States Attorney, the testimony of any witness or the production of books, papers or other evident by any witness in any case or proceeding before any grand jury or Court of the United States involving and then referred to -- then there comes a reference to various statutes dealing with national defense, national security in sedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.021" offset="764029">In those so-called national security cases which I will use in my discussion here today without conceding the propriety or the applicability of the term, it is provided that where the judgment of the U.S. Attorney is to the effect that the testamentary “is necessary to the public interest, he, upon the approval of the Attorney General shall make application.”</text>
            <text syncTime="215.188" offset="860682">I emphasize the word “application” to the Court “that the witness shall be instructed to testify or produce evidence subject to the provision of this section and upon order of the Court,” and I emphasize the words “upon order.”</text>
            <text syncTime="230.391" offset="921496">“The witness shall not be excused in testifying or to testify and receive what is referred to generally in the statute as an immunity against prosecution, as an immunity against penalties or forfeiture.”</text>
            <text syncTime="242.558" offset="970188">The statute is not clear, of course, as to whether -- and no statute actually has been as to whether it's intended by the term “penalty or forfeiture,” a point that we will discuss later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.357" offset="1013342">It should be noted, however, in my passing reference with the statute here that while it appears that immunity is given against the use of the testimony in any court, state or federal, following this Court's decision in Adams, which is common upon the House Committee Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.324" offset="1081260">It is by no means clear, although, this is not the burden of my main argument that the witness cannot be prosecuted in a state court for the crimes which were revealed by his compelled testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.283" offset="1125042">I mentioned that because, as I say, it is a point we make, although, not central to our thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.063" offset="1148238">Now, as to the facts, the petitioner is one of a series of government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.840" offset="1179272">He worked 12 years to the United States Government, retiring honorably in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.199" offset="1200692">A group of government employees, particularly those in the Treasury Department, who, for about eight years, had been subject to accusations by one Elizabeth Bentley of being members of the Communist Party and of an espionage reign in the Treasury Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.684" offset="1274671">As the record shows to this Court, we'll undoubtedly know from general observation, these charges were received great currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.667" offset="1302570">I received the imprimatur of the Attorney General of the United States, a point later to be discussed by me.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.296" offset="1329110">And these witnesses, including the petitioner, have for eight years and here before a congressional committee, grand jury repeatedly, sometimes before the same Committee, sometimes before the same grand jury, sometimes before several committees, and in the particular case, my client was called before the FBI in April 1947, a grand jury in New York in November 1947 and I will discuss the other half after the recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.914" offset="1463589">Without going into all the gory details, Mr. Chief Justice, I should say that over a period of seven and a half years, the petitioner was called eight times before one inquisitorial body or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.800" offset="1527118">Subjected to essentially the identical inquiry with some variations for view of the contacts to the inquiry, but all of them were predicated in one way or another on the Bentley charges of espionage in the Treasury Department in the communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.312" offset="1593156">And although in the early days when things were a little quiet internationally as far as this situation is concerned, the petitioner for example, in his six-hour interrogation by the FBI in April 1947, denied all the charges that Ms. Bentley had made with effect to espionage, Communist Party membership entered with no prosecution that either substantively were under the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.278" offset="1717081">When it came to and when he -- in 1948, he was subpoenaed before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, he unequivocally made the statement appearing at page 12 of the brief that the charges were false, that he'd never been a spy.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.645" offset="1786567">As things moved on and times changed in ways that are well known to the Court that were reflected as more recent decisions, the petitioner moved back because of the very reasonable apprehension upon the constitutional privilege against self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.112" offset="1860441">The latest of these inquiries, and of course, the one that brings us to this Court, that in the Southern District of New York in November of 1954, preceded for the peculiar reasons that have a copy of all of these inquiries by only three weeks before subpoenaing of the petitioner before the grand jury in this District.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.382" offset="1953437">And I should say because it reflects the general attitude of these investigations which have the bearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.946" offset="1975693">But simultaneously, four grand juries in the United States were conducting investigations into the same alleged conspiracy into espionage.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.804" offset="2015190">Somewhat, this is being called before several grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.755" offset="2026998">Witnesses are being called before grand juries in areas where they didn't reside and in a sense following a pattern which as we well publicize in the area of congressional committee operation, but which we have hoped our grand jury system would not spoil air to.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.337" offset="2093244">The petitioner was called in November 1954 before the grand jury of the Southern District of New York and was asked questions in the following character.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.322" offset="2129189">First, Ms. Bentley made the following charges of espionage “Are you or were you a member of the Communist Party?</text>
            <text syncTime="539.319" offset="2157192">Were you a member of an espionage ring?</text>
            <text syncTime="541.965" offset="2167850">Was Harry Dexter White, former Under Secretary of the Treasury, was Mr. Currie, former Administrative Assistant of Franklin D. Roosevelt, our president, was this man -- was that man a member of the Communist Party, a member of an espionage ring?”</text>
            <text syncTime="557.120" offset="2228454">And it must be remembered that the petitioner had previously denied these charges under oath, some five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.491" offset="2253949">It should also be noted that the charges (Inaudible), allegedly under investigation in 1954, were charges of espionage occurring from 1941 to 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.616" offset="2310374">Petitioner asserted his constitutional privilege in the Southern District and was called upon notice to him and his counsel before Judge Weinfeld in the Southern District, and the Government made an application to Judge Weinfeld, the director of petitioner, answer under the Immunity Act of 1954 which I summarize to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.591" offset="2390309">We had an extended argument before Judge Weinfeld and I have given the transcript to this Court as I did to the Court of Appeals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.433" offset="2417685">In the course of the argument, the petitioner took the following position.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.614" offset="2430433">He said, “This is not a bona fide inquiry into crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.006" offset="2444016">This is a broad political issue raised by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.109" offset="2464392">He had publically charged me and members of the old administration with espionage.”</text>
            <text syncTime="622.379" offset="2489469">And the Attorney General having testified publically that he has had proof of espionage since 1945, “But don't let us throw down and I cannot survive an attack by the Attorney General if I testify.”</text>
            <text syncTime="637.186" offset="2548715">The Attorney General is bound, either to follow my testimony before the grand jury with an indictment for substantive crime if he can pick something out of my testimony or it is more likely an indictment for perjury, and not so much in the area, though I don't discount that of a perjury for denying the espionage charges, but perjury for denying charges relating to Communist Party affiliations or the knowledge of others because the problem there is a very special one as this Court knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.137" offset="2664490">The question of what membership in the Communist Party is or was and one's knowledge if someone else's membership of the Communist Party, far from being the precise thing we had thought membership was some years ago has turned out in cases in the records before this Court with Remington and other cases which I've cited my brief to be a far less substantial doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.059" offset="2752157">And the witness who I've lightheartedly denies or likely denies known as lighthearted in this area, of course, knowledge of membership of other people or himself made base a prosecution for perjury, not based upon proof that he was a member, but based upon a broad scheme of circumstantial evidence, now supported by the Communist Control Act's criteria, 14 or 15 criteria to what is the member which may find him guilty of perjury and so he's subjected to a prosecution for perjury regardless of the actual innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.752" offset="2882978">These charges in essence and because I must analyze the law very closely to Your Honors, I can't go into too great detail now, but those are made under oath by petitioner and affidavit to Judge Weinfeld.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.326" offset="2933238">Judge Weinfeld said that he first requested an affidavit of good faith in the United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York and such an affidavit, a formal one, alleging no fact to support it, was given by the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.601" offset="2990393">Secondly, Judge Weinfeld, although requested by us, to examine the grand jury minutes to see that there was no evidence of crime, and to see whether they did not support our position that what was happening was simply the usual practice of congressional committee in calling witnesses before them and asking whether they were members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.919" offset="3071582">Judge Weinfeld declined to examine the grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.147" offset="3084539">He took the position ultimately at any rate that the question of whether immunity should be granted, assuming that the United States Attorney said this was an investigation into a national security crime were the question for the United States Attorney, not for the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.479" offset="3153816">And so, Judge Weinfeld's refusal to deliver the grand jury minutes was consistent with his interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.119" offset="3176385">Allow us -- I may now indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.452" offset="3189760">I think that even he was right in his construction of the statute, which we will challenge, as the judge supervising the grand jury, he had the duty described by Mr. Justice Clark in the Hoffman case to supervise and prevent its excessive, any abuse of its processes, a doctrine referred to so well in the -- in the Hoffman case and previously articulated by this Court or suggested at any rate in Hale against Henkel.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.440" offset="3665711">Now, Judge Weinfeld, at the beginning of the discussion, indicated that he thought that a grant of the -- that the order which he would ultimately enter should contain a specific grant of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.167" offset="3716598">Later on -- and that appears in the transcript -- he decided that he would make no reference in the order, either to a grant of immunity or to the kind of immunity that we were going to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.853" offset="3759334">In other words, he was not merely even going to describe that.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.817" offset="3771246">Now, as I've indicated in my brief, the reason why he undoubtedly did that was because he thought this would be a concession to our general theory that he was granting the immunity because he described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.936" offset="3815654">But as a result, the petitioner took the position before Judge Weinfeld and does here, as he did in the Court of Appeals, that he does not know the extent of the immunity which had offered him upon his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.083" offset="3868317">Now, after Judge Weinfeld overruled our objections and directed the witness to answer questions, including those with respect to political affiliations that we thought were improper, we appealed that, we -- the client to answer those questions before the grand jury and on the bases of the record of stipulated facts before Judge Murphy, who did not review the matter de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.045" offset="3964134">We -- petitioner was convicted of contempt, sentenced to six months in prison with the right to purge and we appealed to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.723" offset="3998824">In one of the tedious arguments ever held, namely, eight days after the conviction with full brief before the Court of Appeals, we argued this matter before, our Second Circuit, Chief Judge Clark, Judge Frank and Judge Galston, sitting by designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.639" offset="4058488">The extraordinary thing about the three opinions which appear at pages 55, 59, and 60, is that each of the three judges who affirmed the conviction below, expressed basic sympathy with our position and suggests that if the matter had come to them de novo, they might well have decided this issue in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.837" offset="4143334">And by this issue, I should be fair to the Court and my opponent and indicate not the construction of the statute which is one of the issues which I will discuss in a moment, but the broad constitutional issue of whether the Fifth Amendment prohibits compulsory testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.085" offset="4212297">We are now here on the opinions of the Court of Appeals that turned out it was the basis for the grant of certiorari raising two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.713" offset="4246779">They are interrelated but they are distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.246" offset="4256914">The first is a statutory construction issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.568" offset="4270184">Was the Court under the duty of determining whether immunity should be granted or was that the sole function of the United States Attorney as Judge Weinfeld held?</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.151" offset="4316578">Because it was perfectly clear from this record that Judge Weinfeld did not examine the record, made those study to determine whether if he had discretion, he would have exercised it because he said, “I have no discretion at the first issue,” and I'm going to discuss that first in deference to the established policy of the Court even though the constitutional issues are so important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.592" offset="4390348">And the second issue, the constitutional issue, which I will next discuss, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.560" offset="4414171">Is this immunity law which moves and moves in the realm of the First Amendment and which carries with it the extra ordinary sanctions which we are -- have described and will describe?</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.277" offset="4457012">Is this immunity law constitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.174" offset="4468611">And I may say in passing that we are not taking on every immunity law and I prepared to distinguish Brown against Walker even though we think this is an original proposition, it too should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.403" offset="4513541">Now, let me turn first to the construction of the statute if I may.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.859" offset="5611416">This statute was rushed through at 28th century speed, I regret 20th century in a rare way which we now use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.977" offset="5639837">It was on historical period in which the Communist Control Act of 1954 and this one on two or three other statutes were passed, and nobody had a chance to formulate language precisely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1511.745" offset="6046929">S-16 gave Congress complete control over the immunity power with respect to its witnesses.S-16 remained on the books in the matter of -- to remain passed by the Senate but not by the House, and the matter came to the House Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.501" offset="6117982">There, the administration through Representative Keating supported a Bill known as H.R. 6899 referred to in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.795" offset="6727158">Well, that rewriting was to interpolate the words, “He, upon the approval of the Attorney General, shall make application to the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.978" offset="6771879">Those words were not an H.R. 6899.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.733" offset="6798838">And when the full committee discussed the reasons for putting in for changing the Bill, what did the full committee say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.434" offset="6829662">It said, “The full committee amendment requires that application be made to a court, whereas, on the H.R. 6899” -- I'm reading from page 40 of my brief -- “only the approval of the Attorney General was necessary, prior to the granting of immunity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.788" offset="6895073">Is there anything ambiguous in that statement and is there anything ambiguous in the statement which follows, which is, after discussing the fact that before congressional committees, "The approval of United States District Court foreclosed the required,” the Committee Report goes on to say, “In cases before a grand jury or a Court similar precaution exists.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.689" offset="6982740">“In all cases,” and these words are very important here, “where the Bill authorizes a grant of immunity after the privilege have been claimed, there are at least two other independent but interested parties, two other independent but interested parties who must concur in the grant of immunity in order to meet the requirements of the Bill.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.233" offset="8428878">First, of course, the direction to testify, that could not have been intended by Representative Keating or the Attorney General or anyone else but that's an inherent power of the Court in its relationship to a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.451" offset="8477780">The Court only has the power to supervise to the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2125.187" offset="8500663">There must be something else intended and that can only be the grant of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.080" offset="8516232">Now, when the Attorney General said in the speech I referred to will be granted by a federal district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.535" offset="8534100">His preceding sentence next to the last was, “The immunity will be granted under the new law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.030" offset="8556042">And when he talks about this, he said, “it”, the immunity, will be granted by a federal district judge after advised by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.605" offset="8586344">Advice, that wasn't the position they took on -- took in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.660" offset="8602540">Their position was that the Court had to grant immunity if they ask for it in a national security case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.367" offset="8625424">We say their words are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.179" offset="8632633">All they were supposed to do is give advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.871" offset="8643396">Now, I don't want to move too far on this -- on the statutory construction but I'm still concerned about the constitutional aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.039" offset="8680072">Surprising to say, I think whether we take a language of the statute in the reference of the word "application” without limitation, and the reference to the word upon order and that shallow order, either we are correct on our construction of the statute in the court below is an error.</text>

            <text syncTime="2215.548" offset="8862093">Now, I want to turn to the constitutional issue because that is so important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.021" offset="8888007">I said before that we felt that the minority view when there were four justices in that minority in 1896 in Brown against Walker was the correct view with respect to the fact that compulsory testimony could not be required under Immunity Act whatever bargain might be made between witness and Government, whatever voluntary bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.244" offset="8980898">It is a hard -- a difficult burden of course to take on all the regulatory statutes and to argue that all of them are unconstitutional and that is – would be the burden of our arguments that's carried forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.242" offset="9024888">It is not necessary for me to carry that argument here for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.227" offset="9044846">First is that we will indicate Brown against Walker is not really the authority that it appears to be in the Government's brief, because of the peculiar fact situation there and I think it's known to the members of the Court which I will recite briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.608" offset="9094374">Secondly, because we are dealing here not with matters of economic regulations as which there are different standard rules and principles, but we are dealing here with the problem of -- what our First Amendment Rights and whether ultimately, our claim of the First Amendment Rights will be found to move to the level of rights which are subject to regulation – reasonable regulation even upon the First Amendment, then this pose of the fact that they are our First Amendment Right and not economic problems that are under the discussion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.429" offset="9197714">And secondly, that in this particular field, in the year 1955, and I've read even in the years 1947 to 1955, maybe in the years 1959 and 1960, the sanctions which are operative against the political dissent are so severe, governmental private, federal and state, group and organizational, that one cannot say that a guarantee against the immunity from prosecution really protects them if one wants reality to guide decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.801" offset="9315161">Now, I come down to my phrase, what did Brown against Walker involve?</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.403" offset="9329580">As the Court knows, I think it involved an auditor at the Allegany Railroad who was called before a grand jury under the Interstate Commerce Act to determine not whether he committed any crime but whether the railroad got an unlawful rebate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.954" offset="9395722">This -- this Court, the Court here in analyzing his approach who is represented by counsel, a very distinguished for railway order, a James C. Carter of the New York Bar, and Mr. Carter wrote a brilliant brief on the subject of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.873" offset="9475448">There was only one mistake I think in the brief that he somewhat exaggerated when he suggested that this railway order was in any danger, but the examples he took of the danger for the railway order indicates the differences between that case and ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.789" offset="9535112">He suggested perhaps an auditing record divulged by the auditor which showed that the auditor, humble employee was in a certain status at a certain time where there was money embezzled or a murder had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.502" offset="9589969">And so, that might furnish a chain of circumstances leading to his conviction for the state crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.781" offset="9611076">Now, obviously, as the Court pointed out in that case, this was stretching even on a memo which deserves very wide stretching for the protection of -- of defendant and witnesses very far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.142" offset="9656529">There was no danger to the witness in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.347" offset="9669381">It was clearly as the expression that yield protecting the corporation or fronting for the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.812" offset="9695190">And then deal what the Court did to corporation under the Fifth Amendment in Hale against Henkel and the decision which followed, we can understand how this particular case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.431" offset="9733642">Nevertheless, there was this very strong dissent, but I suggest as I do in my hearings as I do in my briefs that this was a terrible case and an unfortunate one for us to have to follow here today and elsewhere in which to decide some important constitutional issue as a privilege, because as the Court knows, the privilege was born in a period of the protection of political and religious defense in Puritans in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.118" offset="9832385">It was carried forward here, almost imperceptibly without even being in various English statutes which contained many other rights because it was assumed to be a necessity for democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.708" offset="9874808">It was carried forth in our Bill of Rights which as the Court know would make a condition to the ultimate adaption of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.227" offset="9900826">And I'm unable in assessing to distinguish here between the Fifth Amendment and the Ninth Amendment, the ultimate repository of the people's rights that all of these things were intertwined as the fight which were the conditions to the adaption of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.087" offset="9948264">Now, in this particular area, what everyone may say about regulation of railroads, or antitrust regulation, when you get a real case of political dissent, are we going to be bound by the statement made in the case like Brown against Walker, or must not the most liberal approach be used to the interpretation of these constitutional provision?</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.019" offset="10024020">Is this is not a case where you have to remember as the Chief Justice pointed out in Queen, the historic argument of the privilege and that the Chief Justice pointed out the same case, are we not to remember that the history of the privilege was intertwined with that of the First Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.681" offset="10090684">Because what everyone may say, there is no question but that the position taken by the Puritans in fighting against the oath ex officio was not a position taken against the tortures which the Attorney General now ascribes the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.112" offset="10144392">It was not a question protecting innocent Puritans as the Attorney General suggests in one of his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.996" offset="10163931">I carry them to which one, whether Puritans were guilty or innocent was not important because guilt or innocence doesn't exist when one discuss talks in the field of politics or political dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.627" offset="10210429">You have not guilt or innocence for the problem of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.410" offset="10221610">The right to political dissent was the right, which lifts the oath ex officio and then the right which must destroy this immunity law today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.617" offset="10254420">Now, I will not go into the detailed history of the privilege which we have given on our brief, which the Court had shown such awareness of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.674" offset="10282632">One may say in a sense that the privilege after being -- after being a mark of dishonor for so many years as a result of the publicity put out by various forces in Government and the press has risen to a new high and the result, I think of two forces in this country, one thing, Griswold, to whom we owe so much for his historical study, and the other that worked for this Court in the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.541" offset="10378136">Here, we have for the first time the privilege lifted to that level of respectability, which is discerned unless history has to be disregarded contrary of the warning by the Chief Justice and Judge Magruder in the Maffie case in the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.299" offset="10433097">And here is our chance to protect the privilege in the area in which it was intended and that as I think is the Court's function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.370" offset="10457443">Now, I have discussed this in terms, not in terms of the sanctions which officers have yet, which was really the burden of our argument in the court below, but in terms of why the privilege prohibits compulsory deals with people when you're dealing with First Amendment rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2965.278" offset="11861055">Are you -- you would ask the Court to reconsider Brown and Walker and refused to read the Fifth and ask the Court to read the Fifth Amendment literally and not to interpolate or ask to it by implication.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="2986.389" offset="11945482">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.513" offset="11949976">In other words, you have inquired -- I do not concede that in any area, immunity can be enforced and a witness compelled to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.195" offset="11984771">I do agree that a witness can make a contract with the Government where they use the term “contract or bargain or arrangement,” under which he testified pursuant to an agreement to immunize him and he thereupon receives whatever the immunity is the great take.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.378" offset="12045479">And now, may I turn to the thought which I have thought was the most important part of my argument but as usual, life moves on in these arguments and that is the point made by the Chief Judge below, the point which we have made now for several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.265" offset="12109009">And that, in a sense, doesn't require -- doesn't require my -- this going Brown against Walker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.064" offset="12140251">And -- and I think that the Court understands that whenever my right may be to criticize a court, this Court and the Court against Brown against Walker, I have indicated a very realistic understanding of why Brown against Walker was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.546" offset="12186122">It was a very bad framework for a decision on this constitutional issue, but I refer to the point made by Chief Judge Clark at page 59 of its opinion when he said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.554" offset="12234188">First, he took our first point which I've just been discussing with Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Reed, when he said that this statute undermines and so far forth nullifies one of the basic differences between our justice and that of resistance we condemn, namely, the principle of the individual should not to be forced to condemn himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.194" offset="12300748">That is the point which I just made well or poorly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.364" offset="12313391">The second point is a distinct point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.807" offset="12323213">Practically, as we know, no formal immunity can protect the minority deviator from society dooms when he departs its norms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.463" offset="12357799">And his third point is, and realistically viewed, there is much in the defendant's contention that at the end of the road is a charge of perjury supported by the oath of the renegade or a paid informer, this is Chief Judge Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.045" offset="12408163">And as to the second of these points, our brief elaborates and I wonder whether it is really necessary to go into it fully, the kinds of sanctions operative today in the area of political dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.714" offset="12458841">We're not now discussing whether they're right or wrong but whether if they exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.489" offset="12473887">The fact that in the areas of government employment, a defense employment, a private employment, people are excluded because of their political views, views which -- which they will be compelled under this statute to reveal publicly and grand jury taken and congressional committee cases privately for the moment in grand jury cases, publicly in court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.789" offset="12555076">We point out that the areas of extending government control are sold many today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.120" offset="12576392">Now, what we really have, almost a close society of the kind we had at medieval days when each man was dependent, not upon his ability as an individual, the old pioneer tradition to this country but was dependent upon his fellows, on his trade union, his housing development, his social club, dependent for his everyday livelihood and for his existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.484" offset="12661864">And the terrible things that we've been through in the last 10 years when we saw a witness before a congressional committee thrown out of a parent-teachers association, and we saw other witnesses their house were stoned, compelled to move with their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.360" offset="12709407">These are the things that we talk about that could not exist in Brown against Walker where the order went back to him desperate cheerfully after he testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.744" offset="12746919">These are the things that have destroyed people today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.404" offset="12757577">This is what we say we need protection against, and the Government has used a marvelous expression here, one that I think will play it for the rest of this policy prophylaxis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.798" offset="12807105">Imagine calling this prophylaxis, destroying people's lives in so many areas that have no place to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.151" offset="12832601">But when they talked about areas to which prophylaxis is applied, that assumes that there is an area in existence where people can go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.395" offset="12873561">Well, if we are to be honest and we must as lawyers and judges and arguers drawn at in many areas in which people who had dissensions can go today, there are not many aspects of life in which even private employment where they can live.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.789" offset="12927060">And I pass over for the moment, the fact that in the end of this road, aside from the point made by Judge Clark, the end of the road is a detention and a concentration camp, called a detention camp, but I must have used other words, under the Internal Security Act of 1950, if the Attorney General, in a period of national emergency declared by the President of the United States says that he believes that a person is guilty of espionage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.214" offset="13024758">Well, can that really be suggested by the Government that all of these sanctions of things we're immunized against, they don't mean that the man who had declared a security risk and who admits it under a grand jury -- a grand jury proceeding that information going to the FBI or a congressional committee proceeding or otherwise that that man is going to go to the passport office on 8th Street and get a passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.293" offset="13113156">They don't mean that that's a privilege he's entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.759" offset="13122978">They don't mean that he doesn't have to register under the Communist Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.677" offset="13138651">They don't mean that he can -- that he can sign an affidavit now even though he's a Communist and be an officer of the labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.576" offset="13166237">All of these sanctions are going to operate regardless of the fictitious immunity given under the statute and the Government knows it, and the term “prophylaxis” is a very term in a way because what happens in prophylaxis, you destroy the bacteria or the germs in the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.857" offset="13235409">Unfortunately, we're talking here of human beings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.786" offset="13243141">We're talking about the people that'll be destroyed, very good term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.983" offset="13259860">Now, we have discussed here incidentally aside from the federal governmental sanctions which they may say are civil but which have risen to such a level and are so multifarious as the word civil is no longer appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.363" offset="13309388">They are destructive whether you call them on civil or criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.143" offset="13320568">Quite aside from that, we have pointed out here that there are state laws that are operative, and that those state laws will apply in the present case and that there's no power on the part of the Federal Government to stop state bodies where there are legislative committees and subpoenaing people after they have revealed their crimes before a federal congressional committee or whether they are -- or whether they are witnesses who appeared before the grand jury who in accordance with the policy now in compliance of cooperation with the -- between federal and state authorities in this period of subversive activities, a high-powered cooperation, there is an intercommunication so that what goes to one place may very well go to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.241" offset="13500918">We have pointed that we have made three points here and time will not permit me to them, first, the Court on reevaluating the case is dealing with state and federal crimes will, I think, agree with my analysis that Murdock not withstanding again because of the facts in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.459" offset="13569776">The double sovereignty rule is not the proper rule in this country and that the Federal Government must take cognizance of the possibility of state criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.244" offset="13604885">Secondly, that it cannot be given to a single state -- a federal prosecutor the power to enjoin a state prosecution of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.819" offset="13643233">Whatever may be the rules of supersedure on the field, you can't give the United States Attorney the right to suspend state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.086" offset="13668310">And thirdly, that the (Inaudible) to where the Congress even intended it here, although I admit that that's an ambiguous aspect to this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.934" offset="13695687">I want to save my few minutes for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.068" offset="13704255">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles F. Barber</label>
            <text syncTime="3441.202" offset="13764754">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.698" offset="13774785">I'd like to address myself first to petitioner's argument that no immunity statute could be valid under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.664" offset="13818567">That is that the Fifth Amendment provides a privilege of absolute silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.235" offset="13844898">In the latter part of my argument, I will address myself to its more particular objections to this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.420" offset="13881678">I'm going to stand back just a moment and look into the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.963" offset="13915847">Petitioner has asked this Court to rethink constitutional doctrine that requires as I think to take a short look at the rules of that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.545" offset="13994109">This case presents a question of the accommodation to be made between two principles of equal dignity, both to be preserved which are here in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.839" offset="14051265">Petitioner's dealt wholly with one of this, the principle in which in our law has constitutional sanction that no person shall be compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.939" offset="14115736">I should say at the outset that there may be no doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.135" offset="14132454">That we embrace that principle in words which are recently had been cited by this Court as one of the great landmarks and men struggled to be free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.843" offset="14187311">The competing principle is at equal dignity, and stands at the foundation of justice under law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.399" offset="14225554">That is that the public has a right to every man's testimony</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.720" offset="14258782">We find evidence that this principle is the more ancient in the declaration of Sir Francis Bacon then the King's Attorney General in the account of (Inaudible) case, which was at trial for contempt, for refusal to answer questions put by the House of Lords.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.496" offset="14333910">All subjects declared by Sir Francis owe to the King, tribute and service, not only of their hand indeed, but also with their witness and discovery, whether it be of their own fact or another's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.615" offset="14406426">When two such fundamental principles come in conflict, the usual judicial method is to seek for an accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.177" offset="14440699">When these two principles presented themselves in conflict in the Aaron Burr trial and the question of the scope of the privileges applied to Willie, Aaron Burr's secretary, Chief Justice Marshall at the onset observed that the principle which entitles the United States to every man's testimony, and the principle by which every witness is privileged not to accuse himself can neither of them be entirely disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.425" offset="14569639">In the Immunity Act of 1954, Congress has worked out an accommodation between these principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.090" offset="14604330">We are not here concerned with the wisdom of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.051" offset="14628153">That was seriously, ponderously debated in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.014" offset="14648007">Our question here is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.291" offset="14665143">Has Congress made an allowable judgment, allowable under our Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.242" offset="14704953">I rely heavily on history for the entire tradition of Anglo-American Law from the earliest times to the present, not including the -- not excluding the formulation of the Constitution itself and without significant precedent to the contrary, teaches that this sort of accommodation is a lawful and permissible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.795" offset="14811115">The -- the tradition of granting immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony has roots, definite precedents nearly as old as the precedents which we rely on to show the emergence of the privilege itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.033" offset="14932114">Thus, in 1725, we find the British parliament enacting a bill to indemnify evidence of all present masters and chancery in order to facilitate an -- an inquiry -- I'll correct myself -- in order to facilitate the trial of Lord Chancellor Makerfield who had lately been impeached, a trial I should add not without political implications in that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.554" offset="15050188">This precedent was cited along with a number of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.155" offset="15072549">A few years later, in 1742, in a memorable debate in the House of Lords, on the question of whether a bill to indemnify evidence should be passed to facilitate an inquiry in to the affairs of the (Inaudible), Robert Walpole unto who, until very recently had been Prime Minister.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.537" offset="15170142">At that time, the Bill failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.884" offset="15179442">It failed on grounds of wisdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.362" offset="15193443">The precedence for such a bill was recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.385" offset="15213505">As with more following review of the early history concludes and his scholarship in this field, I think is undoubted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.248" offset="15248927">The tradition of granting immunity from prosecution as a lawful method of annulling the privilege against self-incrimination is unquestioned in English history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.106" offset="15300336">The privilege as petitioner has noted is found in our colonial history as an essential ingredient of the common law tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.182" offset="15348715">As such, it's found its way into the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.274" offset="15365016">But petitioner's argument that the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution should be read as conferring an absolute privilege of silence, I think is foreclosed by the proceedings in the constitutional convention and in Congress in connection with the enactment of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.871" offset="15443383">Madison's journal of the convention shows that when the President's power to grant reprieves and pardons was under discussion.An amendment was proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.148" offset="15500539">The amendment was this that the language, the power -- the President shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons should be -- that that language should be amended to add the words "after conviction," but his journal shows that this proposal was withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.049" offset="15584131">After James Wilson of Pennsylvania pointed out that and I'm quoting from the journal, “That pardon before a conviction might be necessary in order to secure testimony of accomplices.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3912.454" offset="15649750">James Wilson, who made this observation will be recalled, he's one of the outstanding lawyers at the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.975" offset="15675873">He was the first Professor of Law at the College of Philadelphia, soon to become the University of Pennsylvania, and as Your Honors know, was one of the original members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.866" offset="15731461">We find further evidence that the privilege is embedded in the Constitution in the proceedings in connection with the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.815" offset="15771167">The language of the Fifth Amendment was originally proposed by Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.373" offset="15793424">It read as follows, “No person” -- of development clause -- “No person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.079" offset="15836264">When this provision came on for debate, John Lawrence of New York raised an objection to that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.396" offset="15869492">He said, “It contains a general declaration, somewhat conquer to laws passed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.149" offset="15900526">He thought, from the annals, I'm quoting from the annals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.668" offset="15910661">“It ought to be confined to criminal cases,” and proposed an amendment which was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.973" offset="15939814">And so, the Fifth Amendment as we know it reads, "No person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.831" offset="15983282">It is interesting to note that this refinement of language too came from one of the distinguished lawyers of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.103" offset="16012330">John Lawrence had been aid to camp to Washington, had been the presiding Judge Advocate in one of the most famous state trials in our history, that of Major John André, and was soon to be appointed a United States Judge for the District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.653" offset="16082547">Perhaps, I should mention the citations to the constitutional convention and to the proceedings in the annals because this turned up as we continue to research following the submission of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.903" offset="16135523">I have previously given -- given them to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.984" offset="16151928">The reference from the journal of the convention is from (Inaudible)</text>

            <text syncTime="4053.286" offset="16213055">Petitioner has spoken eloquently of the just grievances of the Puritans and other religious descendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.722" offset="16254851">I suggest that they are forever protected against the rebirth of the inquisitions of the 17th century by the First Amendment, so to the right of political dissent unless and until -- and until that crosses the boundary of protected activity by, for example, incitement of the violent overthrow of constitutional government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.953" offset="16355788">I will not hear it as the one of the Dennis issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.497" offset="16365923">That is a separate difficult problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.298" offset="16381179">My point is that absolute protection against criminal consequences for peaceable and orderly dissent is found in the First Amendment, but I find no evidence and petitioner has pointed to none that the Fifth Amendment was intended to confer on the witness in a lawful inquiry into serious crime, a privilege of absolute silence.</text>

            <text syncTime="4695.947" offset="18783713">In dealing with this argument, I'd like to approach it in the alternative.</text>

            <text syncTime="4722.656" offset="18890606">But I have here a statute where Congress sought to exercise its entire power and to grant such immunity if it could and we think it could.</text>

            <text syncTime="4746.393" offset="18985482">This Court, however, has approached that problem in the context of immunity statutes from every end.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.232" offset="19008888">It has upheld state prosecutions against the argument that the State could not and in fact did not protect against federal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.951" offset="19043788">It is -- it upheld federal statutes against the argument that they did not and could not protect against the state prosecutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4791.440" offset="19165727">The reasoning follows from a long series of decisions expressing the principles underlying our federation then from fact the Bill of Rights is a restraint on the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.021" offset="19220062">And so, the grant of immunity has always been interpreted as a restraint only on the sovereignty which grants the immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="4927.794" offset="19711164">This Court could hardly say that legislation like this designed to develop facts relating to wartime espionage is not reasonably necessary and proper and appropriate to the exercise of that federal power.</text>

            <text syncTime="4983.071" offset="19932264">Well I -- maybe we can look together at the statute and then I will state the rationale on which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.027" offset="19976046">The statute is found at page 54 and 55 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.054" offset="20004153">It says "But no such witness shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty," the bottom of page 54 running over on 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.010" offset="20055980">"No such witness shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty on account of transaction matter or a thing."</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.567" offset="20086178">And then, as to the testimony itself, tracking Brown -- the Adams versus Maryland case, it says "nor shall a testimony be so -- so compelled, be used as evidence against him" the last three words "in any court."</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.836" offset="20159321">We think "in any court” means that this Court held in Adams versus Maryland, any federal or state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.917" offset="20187638">We think that a command that no such witness shall be prosecuted applies the proceedings in federal and state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.099" offset="20252317">Now, the rationale of our power -- the rationale of our argument that Congress has the power to do this, we borrow directly from the rationale used by this Court in Adams versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.183" offset="20312712">The inquiry is necessary and appropriate to the exercise of a delegated federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.271" offset="20344999">The means used is not inappropriate to that end, federal law or federal and state laws conflict is supreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.307" offset="20397140">Well, we have the statute before us, I would like turn to this question of whether the statute places in the District Court a non-judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.763" offset="20478955">I question whether the Court will reach any serious question in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.573" offset="20510198">The statute speaks for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.902" offset="20523572">Looking on page 54, it provides that whenever in the judgment of the United States Attorney, a testimony of any witness and so on, dropping down below the numbers, is necessary to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.032" offset="20592118">He, upon the approval of the Attorney General, shall make application to the Court that the witness be instructed to testify, and upon order of the Court, such witness shall not be excused from testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.362" offset="20661394">To analyze the statute, we think in the first place, it authorizes the United States Attorney to do certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.204" offset="20696816">That is one of his judgment, testimony is necessary to seek the approval of the Attorney General and then go before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.900" offset="20731507">It empowers the Court to do certain things, to issue an order when it determines that the testimony is within the framework of the statute and no legal reason exists for the refusal to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.925" offset="20803605">And finally, the statute itself grants the immunity to those who are compelled to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.595" offset="20834325">I suggest that this talk about the Attorney General granting the immunity or the Court granting the immunity is simply a looseness of expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="6736.266" offset="26944993">In closing, I'd like to flash back on where I started and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6744.677" offset="26978638">Our question is whether Congress has made on allowable judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6750.481" offset="27001835">I think we find that the tradition of our law answers yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6756.106" offset="27024405">But now, much can be said, pro and con on the wisdom of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6761.181" offset="27044676">One of the startling thing in the preparation of this case has been to know that the arguments in Congress in 1952 and 1953, the arguments in Congress in 1895, the arguments in Congress in 1857, the arguments in the House of Lords in 1803, the arguments of the House of Lords in 1742 are all but for style of language interchangeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6799.613" offset="27198380">The question of the wisdom of this sort of legislation when you're forced to make an accommodation between two principles which you hold dear is a hard one to make under our Constitution that judgment in the first instance is placed in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6823.140" offset="27292526">Congress has made a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6828.509" offset="27313946">We think that decision is unallowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6832.761" offset="27330978">And for that reason, we respectfully submit that the decision of the law below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="6842.196" offset="27368699">Whether it is worth, the argument made in Congress, in this session were very different from those historically made and adjust themselves to the point which I've made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6851.118" offset="27404434">Secondly, I don't know if any English immunity law which the Court has upheld as requiring compulsory confession, there may be such, but I don't know of any.</text>
            <text syncTime="6859.885" offset="27439438">That (Inaudible) which is referred to here wasn't as I recall it and defeated after Lord Hardwicke, not making the speech which the Government puts in his brief said, “That the public has not a right to require from any man they should betray himself because every man may plead.</text>
            <text syncTime="6876.045" offset="27504118">He's accepted from that demand by the public faith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6879.406" offset="27517597">The contrary to the argument made by the Government, the Government began by denying that Section (c) is an appeal to the Court's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6889.296" offset="27557094">Today, it almost moved to the point of denying that (a) and (b), the English congressional committees gives the Court any latitude despite the use of the word "approval".</text>
            <text syncTime="6897.320" offset="27589277">Now, I suggest that Congress must have intended that a court have a greater power of discretion in connection with grand juries because historically, that's in the Court's power rather than the contrary with respect to the congressional committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6909.749" offset="27638909">Thirdly, I want to point out that in Burdick against the United States, the case which was referred to by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, a pardon withheld not compellable, 236 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="6921.209" offset="27684780">Fourthly, the question here is not whether Dennis is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6924.373" offset="27697424">The question is whether a compulsory confession can operate to a person's injury not whether Congress has the power by testimony outside of its own to restrict him activities and put him in jail and oppose other sanctions against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6937.510" offset="27749982">Now, finally, I think we have to recognize the reality of the situation which didn't exist in 1896, didn't exist in 1857 or in 1862 where the time of any of the Lords.</text>
            <text syncTime="6948.291" offset="27793136">We have gone through a terrible period here and neither powerful dramatically nor do I have to as the Court knows, whether it's been happening in the last eight years in this country, we're going through a loyalty oath and acquisitions and congressional committee hearing, a terrible thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6963.730" offset="27854890">No matter what side you're on, we all recognize the destruction it's made to men's lives, suicides or many in this area and to men's souls.</text>
            <text syncTime="6975.181" offset="27900656">And I suggest here that this Court which has began the process of stopping the destruction of the First Amendment and the destruction of the Fifth Amendment has an opportunity today not to solve the whole problem, obviously not, but to play an important part in accordance with the historic function in and of the courts under the First and the Fifth Amendment of Article 3 in protecting our civil liberties by saying at least here, we will stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="7000.995" offset="28003892">We will not let a man destroy himself out of his own mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="7006.720" offset="28026880">That's the only function I ask this Court to perform today.</text>
            <text syncTime="7009.890" offset="28039523">Thank you.</text>
