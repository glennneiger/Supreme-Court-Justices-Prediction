          </turn>
          <turn speaker="everett_l_looney" startTime="23.671" stopTime="653.425">
            <label>Mr. Everett L. Looney</label>
            <text syncTime="23.671" offset="94668">I think, if Your Honors please, this case is before the Court in actuality, involves a conflict between the integrity of the law on one hand and the hypocrisy of the law on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.070" offset="208248">In order to properly present that thesis, I believe it proper to say that in about May 1954, the Attorney General said to the United States District Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, the case of George B. Parr for an investigation under Internal Revenue Code Section 145 (b) charging -- with -- with charge an attempt to evade and defeat a large portion of his income for the year 1949, 1950 and 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.880" offset="423497">I think it's well to have in mind that at the time the case was sent to the Houston Division that under the venue provision of the 18 U.S.C. Section 3237 the offense to be investigated could have been investigated and indictment could have been returned if the evidence warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.255" offset="524957">And either the Southern District or the Houston District or the Southern -- Southern District or the Western District says Section 3237 provides that where an offense has begun in one district and completed in another, it may be dealt with in either district.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.176" offset="612624">Now, of course, that limitation is -- there's a limitation put on that by -- by Rule 18 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure that the case must be dealt with finally in the division, in the district wherein the offense was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.306" offset="681169">So, after about six or seven or eight months of grand jury investigation in the Houston Division, attended by somewhat of a production in the way of publicity and not usually attended upon a grand jury investigation, one which cause the trial judge at Corpus Christi to admonish counsel when the case was later called for arraignment that no such publicity would be permitted from thereon, except if it'd be from word spoken in open court.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.253" offset="804989">The grand jury returned the indictment on November the 15th, 1954 and the case was filed in the Corpus Christi Division, that being the division in which it was alleged that the offense had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.727" offset="862877">The indictment alleged that the offense had been committed by preparing and causing to be prepared on the part of the defendant for filing in the Collector's Office at Austin in the Western District, a false return by depositing the same in the sub-office of the collector at Corpus Christi in the Corpus Christi Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.808" offset="959216">The case was immediately, in accordance with local rules, put on the trial calendar on November the 15th.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.553" offset="986175">On December the 1st, the case was called for trial in the words of the judge for arraignment, actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.846" offset="1015327">And the defendant was called upon to plead at which time he plead not guilty, asking secured leave of the Court to -- to have until January the 3rd, 1955 within which he filed such motion as might be thought to be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.871" offset="1087425">Before the expiration of that time, the defendant filed for a motion with the Court -- with the clerk, a motion for discovery, a motion for particulars, a motion for -- for production and inspection of documents, a motion for subpoena duces tecum, and lastly, a motion for change of venue from the Corpus Christi Division in the Southern District to the Laredo Division in the Southern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.260" offset="1188989">The -- the Court had given the Government 14 days within which to reply to such motions as it might be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.475" offset="1213858">Then timely, the Government filed opposition to each of the motions including an opposition to the motion for change of venue, the venue motion being the change of being under Rule 21 (a) on the allegation that there were so greater prejudice against the defendant in the Corpus Christi Division that he could not there secure a fair trial, and with a prayer that it be moved to Laredo Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.090" offset="1312287">The Government countered that motion by saying that there was no prejudism in the Corpus Christi Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.175" offset="1344679">That if there was prejudice in the Corpus Christi Division, there was equally as much prejudice against the defendant in the Laredo, the Victoria and the Brownsville Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.796" offset="1387102">That actually, if the defendant wanted to change a venue where he could get a fair trial, the Government suggested it should go to the Houston or the Galveston Division where they said, “We -- we know more about than you do, about where you -- where you can get a fair trial."</text>
            <text syncTime="362.820" offset="1451259">And so, the Government resisted the motion for change of venue only to the extent that they said -- they -- they chose Houston and Galveston.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.518" offset="1498070">Now, that's important, if Your Honors please, because that's where the indictment that I have spoken of was actually returned in the Houston Division, 30 -- 30 miles between Houston and Galveston, the same news media in -- in both areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.707" offset="1558779">But they only set, if it was to be set anywhere, first of all, it should be kept at Corpus Christi.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.306" offset="1577169">If it was to be set anywhere, it should be set to Houston or -- to the Houston Division or -- or the Galveston Division and so the Government contended.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.401" offset="1605590">And the defendant contended in his motion and it -- and it was supported by numerous, a hundred, over a hundred affidavits although 500 newspaper clippings, that not only could he not secure a fair trial in the Corpus Christi Division, but that every other division in the District had been polluted to perhaps a lesser extent with this news media, this terrific publicity that the Court found had attended upon the defendant for years and years down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.102" offset="1744353">That the only place that, if it was to be transferred, that the defendant wanted to be transferred was to Laredo Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.872" offset="1775386">Now, it's maybe important, if your Honors please, to remember that the defendant's home -- home is about halfway between Corpus Christi, which is where court is held in the Corpus Christi Division, and Laredo where court is held in Laredo Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.771" offset="1835050">There was a contest as I've said.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.924" offset="1843618">The Government severely contested the motion for change.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.667" offset="1858664">Now, the Government never did in their motion contesting them in their reply to the motion for moving for a change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.189" offset="1884682">They never did once say that the Government could not get a fair and impartial trial in Laredo if the case was transferred to Laredo.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.269" offset="1933061">They did in their brief, subsequently, say, not in their contest to the motion but in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.524" offset="1958034">They did say that the Government might be, under a severe handicap in the trial of the case at Laredo, should it be transferred to Laredo.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.540" offset="2002129">Now, that was filed in early January.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.006" offset="2015922">On April the 27th, Judge Kennerly, a retire judged, to whom the matter had been transferred for hearing by Judge Allred, the presiding judge of that division, took up the entire matter and found specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.144" offset="2084571">He said, “It's not only shown about preponderance of evidence, but I have no doubt but that the defendant could not receive at the hands of a jury selected in the matter provided a fair trial in the Corpus Christi Division.”</text>
            <text syncTime="534.803" offset="2139115">He says, “The Government suggested I send it to Houston or Galveston.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.919" offset="2159595">They oppose my sending it to Victoria, Brownsville or -- or Victoria, Brownsville and -- and Laredo.”</text>
            <text syncTime="551.286" offset="2205048">The Government opposes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.958" offset="2211736">Now, I find no -- he says, “I find no support for the charge or the contention made in the Government's brief that the Government would be under any handicap, under the slightest handicap, if this case would be tried to -- transferred to Laredo for trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="570.344" offset="2281326">He said that “I am of the opinion that Rule 21 (a), authorizing a transfer does not authorize and neither transfer it anywhere, except Laredo under the motion because the defendant has only conceded to be tried out of this district in the motion which designates Laredo."</text>
            <text syncTime="587.303" offset="2349140">He went on to say that, “From the evidence that I've heard here, if it was within my power, I would transfer the case to Texarkana.”</text>
            <text syncTime="596.871" offset="2387383">That's on the northern limit of Texas, northeastern limit, or to Amarillo which is on the northwestern limit of -- tip of Texas are as far away from the seat of trouble as I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.594" offset="2438374">But as I can see the rule, I'm -- I'm going to see to keep it at Corpus Christi or I must transfer it to Laredo, and finding no reason -- no reason why the Government would be under any sort of a handicap if it goes to Laredo, I transfer it to Laredo.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.880" offset="2491455">Now, that was on April the 27th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.091" offset="2508278">On May the 3rd, 1955, the Attorney General of the United States sent a telegram to -- to the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Texas in care of the United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas in which he said -- what page is that?</text>

            <text syncTime="711.764" offset="2847033">The indictment was returned by the grand jury between that time in 5 o'clock that afternoon of May the 3rd, or on May -- at 5 o'clock that afternoon, Mr. Wilkey, the District Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, he was in attendance before a grand jury in the Western District of Texas, telephoned long distance to Judge Allred who preside at Corpus Christi and requested that the indictment there pending be dismissed, advising him that -- that the Western District had returned the second indictment, and that he wanted it dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.303" offset="2977123">And, that Judge Allred in the memorandum that was filed, directed him to file a motion in the usual way, setting forth his reasons for it and which motion was found on May 4th.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.716" offset="3022785">And Judge Allred on that day, signing business -- court business at Brownsville and not as if enough time to take it up, transferred the motion to Judge Kennerly to the Southern District at Houston to pass on the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.769" offset="3087047">Now, prior to 5 -- subsequent to 5 o'clock of May the 4th or May the 3rd, the date of the indictment, we learned, I learned of the return of the indictment from the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.281" offset="3133022">And I called Judge Allred and told him that in view of what had happened, I had -- I assumed that they were -- that the Government was planning on seeking an indictment of the -- seeking a dismissal of the first indictment, and advised the judge that the defendant wished to be heard in opposition to that move if that move was made at which time he advised me that the United States Attorney for the Southern District had previously called him from San Antonio and told him that that was the move he has to make, that he was going to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.145" offset="3264575">And so, the order of transfer to Judge Kennerly for hearing gave the defendant the right, required that the defendant be given notice of the filing and he be placed on the motion, tell him to be disposed of in accordance with the local rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.019" offset="8572029">One key fact we submit has not been called to Your Honors attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.256" offset="8612989">No mention of this fact has been made in petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.302" offset="8637127">No mention of this fact has been made in petitioner's reply brief even though the Government's brief puts highlights to this fact by putting it in the headings of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.892" offset="8719464">If Your Honors will turn to page 78 of the record, that is Judge Kennerly's opinion in which he granted the motion, the Government's motion to dismiss the indictment of Southern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.346" offset="8801384">Halfway down the page, on page 78, he states, he makes reference to the order which he entered granting the change of venue from Corpus Christi to Laredo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.304" offset="8885185">And he makes this statement, this is the third paragraph on that page, "In reaching that conclusion, or rather in examining the record, I reach this further conclusion that I gravely doubted whether in the administration of justice, generally, the case should be tried in this district at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.032" offset="8980062">I reach this conclusion not as favoring, either the Government or the defendant, but more from the standpoint of a judge who is charged with the administration of justice in the district."</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.681" offset="9034710">He goes on to state that when he came to examine the law, he was, of the view, he was without power to transfer the case outside of the Southern District of Texas, because petitioner on this Court, the defendant below, stated explicitly, and that is on page 17 of the record, "We wish to be clearly understood that if -- if the case is not to be transferred to Laredo, we prefer that it remained in Corpus Christi."</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.228" offset="9176816">That key finding that the interest of justice would be best served by having the case tried outside the Southern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.569" offset="9214224">We believe it puts a very different light on what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.639" offset="9246511">That is really the key finding and no mention is made of it in either the brief or the reply brief which the petitioner has find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.954" offset="9287784">We assume that petitioner considers this fact immaterial to the -- to his potential, to his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.407" offset="9333551">But we do not see how this case can be consideredother than in connection with this particular fact-finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.149" offset="9376496">Now, what is this fact-finding based on that it was in the best interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.686" offset="9398648">We can go on, on page 78 and 79 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.517" offset="9414008">He said, "If I had authority, I would have sent the case elsewhere."</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.308" offset="9433130">Mr. Looney called that to Your Honors attention, to send it to some of those places as far removed from the scene of the trouble as I could or as I could find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.298" offset="9469179">This is at the top of page 79 of the record, "I would have done that, not as a favor either to the defendant or the Government, but because I feel that justice in the case would be best administered by transferring the case to one of these places."</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.689" offset="9534694">Now, in evaluating, a lot of reference has been made to the extent to which the cards relayed on the table, I think the opposition concedes that the -- know that -- but all the facts were before the Court, the Government filed the Assistant Attorney General Holland's telegram with its motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.927" offset="9627690">It filed written reasons for its motion to dismiss set forth on pages 22 to 27 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.007" offset="9671993">It gave extensive oral reasons at the hearing, which Your Honors will find on pages 39 to 43 of the record, and throughout this, throughout the statement of reasons, it's made very clear that the -- the Government's thinking was highly collared by the decision of the Court to transfer the motion -- to -- to transfer the prosecution to Laredo, a division in which petitioner was reputed to have a very substantial degree of political power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.536" offset="9838132">We have set forth in the appendix to our brief, pages 77 to 82, two interesting affidavits which were filed by Mr. Hayden Head, a leading lawyer in Corpus Christi, one filed by petitioner in which Mr. Head said, “Though I am an opponent, I have engaged in political opposition to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.420" offset="9937607">I, as a lawyer, want to be sure that he has a fair trial".</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.664" offset="9962580">It seems that the publicity which was developed in Corpus Christi makes that a very doubtful whether a fair trial could be held in the Corpus Christi Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.717" offset="10010854">At the same time, he provided the Government with an affidavit that for the same reason -- it's on page 81 -- it is my equally firm opinion that the United States of America could not obtain a fair and impartial trial if the trial of the courts against George B. Parr were transferred to the Laredo Division of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.461" offset="10101760">On page 82, the situation is the converse in Laredo of the situation in the Corpus Christi Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.533" offset="10134047">There's a -- these affidavits were filed after the petitioner had made it clear that he wanted transfer to Laredo only, and if he was content to remain in Corpus rather than transfer somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.350" offset="10221296">We call attention to the Government's position laying all its cards on the table, page 124 of the printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.790" offset="10259122">This was the Government's reply to petitioner's application for change of venue, in which on page 124, the reply analyzes the basis of the prejudice which -- on which petitioner was claiming the right to transfer, the prejudice being alleged to arise principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.592" offset="10434351">That is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2629.313" offset="10517211">Now, Judge Kennerly did say on page 19 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.271" offset="10545006">That was in his opinion when he transferred the -- the case to Laredo, "I do not think that the evidence shows that the Government either will or might be under a severe handicap in the prosecution of this case as claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.077" offset="10620238">I find to the contrary, although, such lawyers as Mr. Hayden Head whom I have cited, Mr. (Inaudible), a leading trial lawyer in Corpus Christi who has tried cases all over the Southern District, made similar affidavits."</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.568" offset="10682201">I think on balance, if there was only a choice between two districts, as Judge Kennerly thought, that in fairness to defendants, should perhaps if there's any doubt, the advantage should be given to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.929" offset="10743641">But the position the Government took, as I was calling to Your Honors attention on page 124, we do not oppose transfer to secure a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.100" offset="10788362">That's at the bottom of page 124, a transfer to secure a fair trial the Government does not oppose and suggested this Court should be transferred to Houston, Galveston or some point outside the Southern District where according to defendant's own facts and theory, a fair and impartial trial may be held.</text>

            <text syncTime="2758.573" offset="11034227">The note on Rule 21, it was stated by the Advisory Committee by making a motion for a change of venue, however, the defendant waives the constitutional right to be tried in the district in which the crime is alleged to have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.207" offset="11104758">Now, that must be solved because all you would have to do in order to -- all the defendant would have to do in order to pick a -- a very favorable place for trial, it's relatively easy to, in any crime, which gives rise to a lot of emotions, to establish a probability of prejudice where a lot of publicity is given to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.136" offset="11216457">It would invite shopping, venue shopping by defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.839" offset="11235265">It's -- it's known that certain judges have very disparate views of what a proper sentence within legal limits says on a particular type of offense to suggest an invitation to a defendant to -- if he can establish a real question that he might get a fair trial, that he might be unable to get a fairly chosen jury in a particular district, choose a district in which a judge had a reputation for being a relatively easier sentencer than in some other districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.603" offset="11374341">You have different views on -- in different parts of the country on the seriousness of particular crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.986" offset="11411853">In my own State of Texas, the crimes involving where there has been a fight over a lady and a killing results, the jury is a notoriously very lenient, and the prosecution for -- though I don't see a federal offense there, a prosecution for that in one district might be very dishonorable from the defendant's point of view if he could select his district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.965" offset="11535778">In other words, we don't believe that the rules over contemplate selecting one district and say, “We established a possibility or probability of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.386" offset="11577469">We want to be tried in one district and this is the only one,” and that's what Judge Kennerly's interpretation of his power was.</text>

            <text syncTime="4935.552" offset="19742198">So, there could be a review of that question, following a subsequent conviction, not in this case, but in a subsequent case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5674.299" offset="22697169">And that the basic error, which caused all these diffulties was Judge Kennerly's error in thinking that he could only transfer to Laredo, but the defendant could shop for a -- a specific venue when he was able to establish a degree of prejudicism.</text>
            <text syncTime="5693.259" offset="22773029">Since my time has officially expired and the elements on the merits have been fairly well developed in this discussion of the -- of the facts, we respectfully submit that the District Court's order which the District Court found was entered in the interest of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.088" offset="22860278">That the interest of justice justified this dismissal to do what it felt it couldn't do otherwise, that that order should be left understood.</text>
