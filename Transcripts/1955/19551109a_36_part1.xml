            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Next case is Number 36, Clifton Alton Poret verus -- and Edgar Labat, Petitioners, versus State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.946" offset="75755">Mr. Lozes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felicien_y_lozes" startTime="19.851" stopTime="400.290">
            <label>Mr. Felicien Y. Lozes</label>
            <text syncTime="19.851" offset="79308">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.700" offset="102713">I represent the defendant, Edgar Labat, whose codefendant with Clifton Poret in Number 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.585" offset="154331">At the outset, let me say that I feel that I am somewhat in agreement with Mr. Hubert and Mr. Justice Frankfurter and others with the general approach towards Article 202.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.614" offset="218384">However, it is my contention that the proper interpretation of Article 202 by this Court, so as to ascertain if due process has been afforded, the petitioner depends upon all of the circumstances surrounding the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.524" offset="330083">And this Court might consistently say in one case of Article 202, deprived him of due process because of the manner, the circumstances surrounding the administration of Article 202, either through a design of the state officials or possibly through negligence or over side of the state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.118" offset="436454">I think the important point and the real point before this Court is whether in fact, in fact, based on all of the circumstances surrounding the case, the administration of Article 202 by the Court, the lower court, by the state officials, the district attorney and by the Supreme Court, and by everyone who had anything to do with the case, whether in fact the defendant and petitioner here was denied the right of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.519" offset="610011">That, may it please the Court, is what gives this Court its strength, its power and its validity, the right to inquire and the right to say, “We have seen discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.804" offset="667167">We have seen a refusal of due process and we will strike it down.”</text>
            <text syncTime="173.759" offset="694962">Now, gentlemen of the Court, the facts of the case of Edgar Labat insofar as they applied to the motion to Article 202 are relatively simple and on page 1 of the transcript of the record, and two, they're clearly indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.115" offset="780434">The record shows that Edgar Labat was arraigned on January 3rd, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.892" offset="827559">The record shows that the above name, defendant in person, was placed at the bar of the Court to be arraigned on charges filed against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.913" offset="867579">And after hearing the indictment, together with the endorsements thereon read, the defendant, unattended by counsel, at arraignment, the defendant unattended by counsel pleaded not guilty thereto, circumstance number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.569" offset="942184">The Court informed the defendant of the seriousness of the charges and inquired that he was in a position to employ counsel by his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.929" offset="987638">The defendant notified the Court that his family was in the process of hiring counsel for his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.826" offset="1027239">The Court notified the defendant to let the Court know on Friday, January 5th, if he had retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.755" offset="1059004">That's two days to give to a full ignorant Negro and the record shows that the hospital orderly right to employ counsel -- time to employ counsel in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.769" offset="1123056">And I might say, parenthetically, a case in which it is difficult sometimes to get counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.601" offset="1166315">So, he then see January 5th, two days later, Edgar Labat is brought before the Court and the record says, “The Court this day appointed E. I. Mahoney as counsel to represent the accused, counsel notified.”</text>
            <text syncTime="313.535" offset="1254087">And then, the record speaks with an eloquent sounds for one year and 24 days and the next minute entry is January 29th, 1952, trial continued withdrawal of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.048" offset="1360144">And turning over, we see the pertinent part, E.I Mahoney, Esquire, moved the Court to allow him to withdraw his name as counsel of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.177" offset="1412702">And then, later on through the record, we find that the defendants' employed attorney came into the case either in March or in June.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.046" offset="1456170">And I have studied the record as carefully as I can and I'm unable to ascertain just when Mr. Gill, the defendants then employed counsel, came into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.145" offset="1508519">It -- the record does indicate that Mr. Gill was sitting in the courtroom at the time, here.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.346" offset="1537358">But later, there is testimony indicating that maybe Mr. Gill came in, in March, and maybe he came in, in June.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.153" offset="1568601">Incidentally, I might state that I did not come into this case until after rehearing was refused by the Louisiana Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.148" offset="1640490">I do know that for a substantial part of that time, I personally know because I knew Mr. Mahoney.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.947" offset="1663687">And I think that everyone knows that is around the Court that Mr. Mahoney was in bed for some seven months of this period of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.076" offset="1704229">Now, just what exactly Mr. Mahoney was doing from the time he was appointed until after the three days, after the end of the grand jury time run out?</text>
            <text syncTime="440.428" offset="1761698">I do not know.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.052" offset="1836199">And when the grand jury expired on March 5th, and the three-day period would be March 8th, as I count.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.252" offset="1876950">Now, what Mr. Mahoney did from January until March because I see by the record there's nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.635" offset="1922508">Mr. Mahoney is dead now, so he can't even be of any help.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="486.971" offset="1947794">Well, how can he -- how can we tell from this record whether he just made a deliberate choice not to make a motion?</text>

            <text syncTime="495.318" offset="1981231">We cannot tell from the record, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.427" offset="1997636">And of course, I -- I took the record as it -- as it came to me, but I think it is significant that the only thing that Mr. Mahoney did in this case was to withdraw from it when apparently, a year later, this defendant family apparently got to gather some money to employ Mr. Gill and at about that time, Mr. Gill seems to be hovering in the background of the case because the minute entry says Mr. Gill was in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.498" offset="2149982">So, it can only be my conclusion from this record that this defendant, during all of the time that his rights were running out of -- was represented by virtually no counsel, counsel who did nothing whatever for him and there was no way of course of getting that into the -- into the record other than, “Here is the record,” at the time that we took up the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="960.290" offset="3841149">And that's just a standard phrase that they say, “Well he had represented by able counsel.”</text>

            <text syncTime="990.926" offset="3963611">Under the circumstances, when a lawyer was appointed and they said, “Well, we're going to hire a lawyer,” and nobody does anything for him, the State doesn't do anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.321" offset="4109270">He didn't have anything and the complex situation of whether Article 202 applies, whether Article -- the other various articles that have been quoted in here apply, whether he had a right to go in and file it before a later arraignment and I might say on that score, I know in -- and I've been with the exception of the war years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.070" offset="4752196">May I go to the -- the next point in the case that I have argued and submitted on the brief and that is, that again, where this Court should assume the jurisdiction in the case of this type to a right or to permit a defendant, to assert his federal rights in these two well-known instances and I submit that they both apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.234" offset="4888869">And I give the well-known instances that were given by this Court by the minority in the recent case of Williams versus Georgia at the last term of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.624" offset="4938397">And that is, first, where the circumstances give rise to an inference that the state court is guilty of an evasion, namely, an interpretation of a state law with the specific intent to deprive a litigant of a federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.934" offset="5019690">And I submit that a clear, accurate analysis of the Wilson case in all of its circumstances and all of its surroundings will show that the Court took the plain meaning of a law which said, “You've got to -- you've got three days here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.495" offset="5109969">The motion was filed sometimes after that and they reinterpreted that so as to put a new time limit on it and say, “Ah, we got a new time limit on it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.177" offset="5160647">Three days after the time, you're still too late so you're electrocuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.476" offset="5181858">Now, I submit that that was an interpretation which later the Court itself said, “He's trained judicial legislation, all of the circumstances surrounding that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.405" offset="5233580">But we got -- we've got an interpretation here on the Wilson case, the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.842" offset="5255314">Now, the law review writer, Dr. Bennett of Louisiana State University, an outstanding authority says, “This Article 202 as interpreted in the Wilson case provides a very complex situation especially when defendants are not represented by counsel at arraignment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.955" offset="5351758">And the Louisiana -- I mean the Tulane University commentator says, “This is one of the devices used by the Courts of Louisiana to sidestep the issue of racial discrimination in criminal cases.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.456" offset="5429812">Now, gentlemen, you've held further and secondly that where a state law honestly though applied, and this is a ground that I would prefer to go on, honestly, though it may be and even dictated by presidents, throws such obstacles in the way of the enforcement of federal rights that it must be struck down as unreasonably interfering with the vindication of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.366" offset="5553424">Now, we submit that it has been judicially admitted here that for the -- since the time of men, the memory of men run, not to the country of Louisiana has never released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.423" offset="5609639">The Parish of Orleans has have -- never had a Negro on the grand jury until just about a month ago or month and a half ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.360" offset="5645375">We submit that that shows a prime facie case of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.189" offset="5672751">We submit that we -- this defendant should have a right, having a prima facie case before the Court should have a right to show it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.699" offset="5710785">We submit that it is a result, either of deliberate evasion or even though they are honestly applying it, the obstacles placed in the way of these defendants or actually asserting the right mean even getting a day in Court as set up and as -- as modelled up by Louisiana with Article 202 is such that it should be struck down by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1476.938" offset="5907749">And I submit that, Your Honor, in Smith versus Texas, this Court very amply expressed the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.123" offset="5948395">It's -- this Court said in the last lines of that case at 311 U.S.on page 128, “If there has been discrimination, whether accomplished ingeniously or ingeniously, the conviction cannot stand.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.660" offset="6022583">Finally, Your Honors, I submit that since both Labat, my client, and Poret, Mr. Becker's client were indicted by the same grand jury and under the same indictment itself that if for any reason, Your Honors, should find that a new trial should be granted to Poret, Mr. Becker's client, then the same new trial should be granted to my client because the Louisiana law has held for some 80 years that if the grand jury falls, the indictment under is -- is illegal.</text>
