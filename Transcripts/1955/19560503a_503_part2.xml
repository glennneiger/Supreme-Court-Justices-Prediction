            <text syncTime="11.534" offset="46080">A question was raised just before the recess as to whether or not a hearing is mandatory under Section 244 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.054" offset="108147">Whether or not a hearing is mandatory, we submit that there -- it is contrary to the expressed intent of Congress to permit the use of confidential information in connection with the suspension proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.805" offset="191216">When Congress intended to authorize the use of confidential information, it had no difficulty in expressing its intent unmistakably as witness Section 235 (c) of the Immigration Nationality Act, which is referred to on pages 37 and 38 of the Government brief, which relates to the question of exercise of discretion on the admission and that is on the exclusion of persons applying for admission and Congress explicitly stated that in such proceedings without any inquiry or without any further inquiry by a special inquiry officer, the Attorney General is authorized to use confidential information and not disclose it to the alien applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.473" offset="441887">On the contrary, as is already been pointed out, Section 244 of the Act which authorizes suspension of deportation specifically requires that Congress be furnished a -- with the reasons that suspension of deportation is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.482" offset="529868">The regulation challenge here, however, without differentiating says that whether it is granted or denied -- whether it is granted or denied it may be based upon confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.004" offset="579918">Now, this violates a -- the other section of the statute which is -- the other section of regulations which we contend specifically are nullified --</text>

            <text syncTime="225.812" offset="903210">Our position is that Congress did not authorize the use of confidential information and the language of Section 244 (c) which requires a report when it is granted indicates that in such cases, certainly, Congress did not intend that the granting should be based upon confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.899" offset="995579">That is it didn't intend the use confidential information in a suspension hearing where suspension is granted because if confidential information is used, Congress isn't being given the reasons that the suspension is granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.865" offset="1107383">Now, let's assume that there was no hearing provided for by the Attorney General then wouldn't he be free to act in his discretionary capacity on any information that he might have from any place as he would in the clemency proceeding?</text>

            <text syncTime="948.053" offset="3792144">Now, it is true that in approximately four-fifths of the so-called deportation cases that are heard, deportability is not contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.286" offset="3841045">The question is whether or not to give the alien voluntary departure which is quite different from suspension of deportation or suspension.</text>

            <text syncTime="976.217" offset="3904784">There were -- there was one hearing, it was closed and then reopened again to consider the question of suspension of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.287" offset="3933100">But in most cases, there's no question about deportability and in most of the cases in which there's no question about deportability, the issue is whether or not the aliens to be given voluntary departure, that is to say allowed to leave the country freely without being deported in order that he will not be barred if he tries to reenter at a later date because he has been deported in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.694" offset="4018678">Suspension does not require the alien to leave the country at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.227" offset="4516885">But when it comes to the operation of the discretion, bear in mind that this discretionary power and this is the Government's position is so broad and so unique and so much of a blank check that the Congress has provided that it does not even become operative until the alien can show that he is eligible for this relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.067" offset="4624196">The reason -- and when the discretion does become operative, then it is the Government's position that the -- it is entirely within the legislative purpose that the Attorney General can take into consideration in making his decision any information that he deems appropriate and necessary providing he stays within the limits of the applicable regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.428" offset="4713639">Now, this might include hearsay evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.244" offset="7212931">As I read Section 244, the suspension provision, it provides as follows that as herein after prescribed in this Section, “The Attorney General may, in his discretion, suspend deportation et cetera of an alien who is deportable for various reasons.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.341" offset="7285342">And then it goes on and it gives the list of qualifications which are very stringent qualifications that must be met before this discretionary power becomes operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.392" offset="7337482">In other words, if you turn to (c), subparagraph (c) on the following page, “Upon application by any alien who is found by the Attorney General to meet the requirements of (4) or (5) of subsection (a), the Attorney General may, in his discretion, suspend deportation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.236" offset="7424940">In other words, Congress had a purpose to deport deportable aliens and it very carefully withdrew all discretion from the Attorney General when it came to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.234" offset="7476872">Section 241, the deportation section says that the Attorney General must deport and then list section after section of the most carefully spelled out provisions hitting aliens who the Congress has decided, whether or not we agree with the substantive grounds and as -- is not any of my business or the Court's business at this point, must be deported and it then goes on after saying in Section 241 that deportation must be affected of these aliens, it prescribes in Section 242 of the Act very careful procedures to effect this deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.377" offset="7661505">Now, I'm referring to page 15 of the Government's brief in Footnote 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.613" offset="7690449">Note what the statute provides, “That the special inquiry officer shall conduct proceedings that determination of deportability in any case shall be made only upon a record at which the -- the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to be present.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.368" offset="7761398">Turning the page, “The Attorney General may prescribe regulations which shall include requirements that the alien shall be given notice of the charges, shall have the privilege of being represented, reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him, to present evidence on his own behalf, cross-examine and that this procedure so prescribed should be the solemn exclusive procedure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.687" offset="7854707">Now, this is deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.777" offset="7863066">When it comes to suspension, the only thing that the Congress saw fit to say was that the Attorney General in four words “may, in his discretion,” suspend deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.781" offset="7911027">The alien in order to be even qualified for this extraordinary relief is required to show that he meets these most stringent requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.868" offset="7955435">Now, there may be lots of other aliens who have done -- committed no worst substantive offense perhaps less, who have got to leave the country but they can't meet these requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.136" offset="7996500">My point is this then that Congress, knowing that it was giving the Attorney General a blank check and that it had to give the Attorney General a blank check in order to make this power useful or effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.321" offset="8045192">It -- it's no good unless it's as broad as it can possibly be for this reason, but you can't categorize cases where the Attorney General should grant the armor of clemency anymore than you can categorize the cases in which the Congress has seen fit to enact special bills.</text>

            <text syncTime="4391.865" offset="17567451">First, the meaning of Section 235 (c) and second the claimed analogy between the power to suspend and the power to pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.006" offset="17599948">Section 235 (c) relates to the exclusion of immigrants aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4405.450" offset="17621786">That is the class which for all practical purposes has no rights under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.214" offset="17648849">This class here is not a deportee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.955" offset="17663791">It's an alien who is deportable because under the statute suspension cannot be granted if a final order of deportation has been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.974" offset="17699840">At the moment, therefore, when his application is considered, he's not a deportee, he's a person against whom a deportation proceeding is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.891" offset="17735471">Now, when Congress authorized the use of confidential information and by the way this Court has not yet upheld that use and Knauff and Mezei cases dealt with the war time or emergency statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.574" offset="17794194">Section 235 (c) is the statute that has nothing at all to do with emergencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.289" offset="17817078">But assuming that 235 (c) is valid, Congress said, "You don't have to give him a hearing if you use confidential information," because it recognized that you can't have both concepts, a hearing and confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.042" offset="17872144">Mr. Lindsay has said that half a loaf is better than none.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.567" offset="17886250">I think that the half a loaf is poisoned, it is not better than none.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.954" offset="17899729">The alien who comes to the hearing, thinking that he is getting a right of some kind and as said walks into a snare, he's no better off and that there were no hearing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.512" offset="17946018">As a matter of fact, he may be worst off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.474" offset="17957825">Now, as to the analogy to pardon, the action of a president in refusing to issue a pardon is absolutely non-reviewable, no matter how arbitrary it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.768" offset="17998994">The acts of the President or those of an independent branch of the Government and this Court cannot review them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.112" offset="18024385">But this Court can review and the Government has conceded that this Court can review a manifest abuse of discretion by an attorney general and there are cases where the lower courts have made this reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.953" offset="18083736">I want to point out other distinctions in the pardoning power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.413" offset="18097633">The pardoning power, unlike the power here, is not divided among the whole hierarchy with a special officer, Board of Immigration Appeals, the Attorney General and Congress, it's the act of a single man who in private, according to his own conscience, decides to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.641" offset="18162521">Secondly, there is a vast difference in the power to review the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.918" offset="18187598">Now, Mr. Lindsay was asked by several members of the Court as to where the judges -- where the Attorney General's discretion ends and the Government's brief concedes that where it appears in someway that there's been abuse of discretion, this Court can review them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.752" offset="18262936">Now, it doesn't have to appear on the record if we can show by independent means that the Attorney General has been bribed or is corrupt or is actuated by racial or religious prejudice, the Court would still review it whether it appeared on the record or in his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4584.343" offset="18337332">I'd like to emphasize as well that this Court in McGrath against Kristensen stated that the alien had a legal right to be considered for suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="4599.132" offset="18396473">That's the right that granted him by the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.674" offset="18414655">That's a far different situation from the criminal -- convicted criminal, who as of matter of grace, entreats the President to pardon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.493" offset="18449972">He has no rights at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.277" offset="18457078">This alien has a right to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.291" offset="18465123">And in the McGrath case, this Court reversed the Attorney General when he found that the alien was not eligible for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.275" offset="18497097">I'd like also to quote, because I think the language is apt, the paragraph from a decision in this Circuit -- in this District, the decision of Judge Morris involving the use of confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.810" offset="18563239">He said there is no place in this government for arbitrary actions and there is no way to know whether such action is arbitrary or not, unless the basis upon which it is taken is revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.465" offset="18625829">If -- when Congress gave the Attorney General the power to act in his discretion, it didn't intend that he would have an absolute and limitless power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.678" offset="18670655">The term discretion is a word that means implicit in it that the discretion will not be arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.492" offset="18701897">Thank you.</text>
