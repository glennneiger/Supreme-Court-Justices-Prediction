            <label>Mr. Manfred W. Ehrich, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="84.197" offset="336771">This case presents the question of whether the Federal Arbitration Act applies or whether under the Erie doctrine, the state law applies as to the enforceability of an arbitration agreement in a contract which had to do with an intrastate matter and which is before this Court purely because of the diversity of this -- of citizenship of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.046" offset="480131">The contract was a contract by which Mr. Bernhardt, the petitioner here, was employed by Polygraphic Company as a plant manager in Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.010" offset="555990">The contract was drawn in New York by the attorneys of the company and included an arbitration agreement drawn with the New York law in mind and so it provided that it should be interpreted according to the New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.983" offset="655882">Suit was brought in Vermont because Mr. Bernhardt was fired before the contract had ran and it was brought in the state court and was removed to the Federal District Court on the ground of diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.925" offset="735608">Then the company asked for a stay until arbitration had been had.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.293" offset="773120">And the District Court ruled with us that they would not grant a stay basing their decision on the Erie doctrine and then the Circuit Court reversed and we appealed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.775" offset="843024">There was -- arbitration was put into motion by the company, and now before we got to this Court, we had to have the Circuit Court stay the arbitration pending the decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.530" offset="926093">We -- we feel that this is a plain case for the application of the Erie doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.826" offset="991295">And we feel that the Circuit Court was in error in holding that there was no substantive right here in the Erie sense of which of course is different from the normal sense of substantive as against procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.022" offset="1095993">And we feel that the cases relied on by the Circuit Court do not support the decision because they do not involve our situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.515" offset="1181989">The Erie case established the doctrine that under the Judiciary Act, the unwritten law as well as the statutory law of the State must be applied in a diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.849" offset="1259311">And the law of Vermont is the common law which, as we have briefed and as the other side has conceded below, would not involve the enforcement of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.253" offset="1312914">By Vermont law, an arbitration contract is not illegal, is not invalid but is unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.802" offset="1351158">So that if the parties come willingly before the Arbitration Board then arbitration will be had and will be binding but neither party can force the other party to arbitrate and either party can withdraw at anytime until the award is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.130" offset="1456483">The company seems to rely now on the Federal Arbitration Act and the question is whether the -- one of the questions is whether the Federal Arbitration Act applies in a purely diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.234" offset="1556898">The cases were the Federal Arbitration Act has been applied or none of them were diversity cases in the sense that the parties were before the Court purely because of diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.452" offset="1637773">Guaranty Trust Company against York which was a very able explanation of what the Erie case intended of -- involve the New York statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.224" offset="1704856">And it was held in that case that although the statute of limitations is considered to be procedural under the common law definition of substance and procedure, yet it must be applied because its application would substantially affect the result of the case.</text>
