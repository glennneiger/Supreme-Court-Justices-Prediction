            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="14.337" offset="57260">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.144" offset="88503">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.588" offset="102296">This case brings here for review a decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, Judge Bazelon dissenting, which affirmed an order of the Subversive Activities Control Board ordering the petitioner to register as a Communist action organization under Section 7 of the Subversive Activities Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.424" offset="217652">The order of the Board was issued after a hearing held pursuant to the Act and was accompanied by a report in which the Board set forth its findings as to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.756" offset="275017">The case in our view presents questions of the highest public importance as to the constitutionality of the Act, and also as to the Act's application by the Board and the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.534" offset="346070">The Act was passed over a Presidential veto in September of 1950 during the early months of the Korean War.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.947" offset="391732">The first point that I shall argue here today is that the Act, on its face, and as applied, violates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.247" offset="440947">I shall show that under the guise of a registration statute, the Act, in fact, represents an attempt, I submit, without precedent in this country to -- to coerce conformity by suppressing advocacy, association and collective activity for wholly legitimate purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.791" offset="563096">The Act provides for proceedings before the Board to be initiated upon petitions of the Attorney General, to determine subject to judicial review whether an organization is a Communist action, a Communist front, or a Communist infiltrated organization, all three of these organizations being collectively referred to as Communist organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.162" offset="680647">A Communist action organization is defined in Section 3 (3) of the Act as an organization which, and I quote, "(1) is substantially directed, dominated, or controlled by the foreign government or foreign organization controlling the world Communist movement referred to in Section 2 of this title, and (2) operates primarily to advance the objectives of such world Communist movement as referred to in Section 2 of this Title."</text>
            <text syncTime="203.647" offset="814498">Section 2 finds that the world Communist movement referred to in this definition is directed and controlled by a foreign power, operates through the medium of world -- of a worldwide Communist organization composed of Communist action organizations in the various countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.407" offset="897567">And has as its purpose the establishment of Communist totalitarian dictatorships throughout the world by means of espionage, sabotage, terrorism, treachery, deceit, infiltration, and any other means deemed necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.041" offset="972069">Communist-front and the Communist infiltrated organizations are defined by the Act in terms of their control by a Communist-action organization and their purpose or objective of effectuating the purposes of a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.677" offset="1050645">Communist action and front organizations are required to register as such with the Attorney General when a registration order issued by the Board becomes final as it does upon the exhaustion of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.158" offset="1116578">Communist infiltrated organizations are not required to register but are deprived of the benefits of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.532" offset="1162031">The registration statement of a Communist-action organization must list the names and addresses of all of the officers and of all of the members of the organization, give a detailed financial accounting, and list of printing, mimeographing and other duplicating equipment in the possession of the organization, its members or other organizations in which it has an interest.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="318.817" stopTime="322.834">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="318.817" offset="1275193">Is there in the record a sample registration form?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_abt" startTime="322.834" stopTime="625.750">
            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="322.834" offset="1291285">Not in the record, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.212" offset="1296823">The Attorney General has prepared and publicized and has available such forms, and I'm, if the Court, of course, may take judicial notice of those forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.801" offset="1343112">Members whose names are, let me say it first, the registration statements are open for public inspection and they must also be kept current biannual reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.833" offset="1391282">Members whose names are not listed in a registration statement filed by the organization must register themselves after a -- an administrative determination of their membership in the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.159" offset="1448542">Now, in view of the definition of a Communist action organization in the Act, it is clear that a registration order requires the organization to stigmatize itself or the members that they require to register to stigmatize themselves as participants in a foreign controlled seditious conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.333" offset="1545300">The failure of the officers to comply with this requirement by registering the organization, or the failure of the members to register themselves, if they are required to do so, is punishable by five years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine, both cumulative for each day that the failure to register continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.100" offset="1640385">So the penalties may become almost astronomical.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.456" offset="1661806">A final registration order also automatically invokes a series of crippling sanctions against both the organization and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.234" offset="1708931">All of these sanctions, it's important to note and should be emphasized, become operative whether or not the organization registers or whether or not the members register.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.357" offset="1765355">In other words, compliance relieves neither the organization nor the members from these sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.052" offset="1792104">Sanctions are the following, first, the organization must label all literature and publications which it distributes in the mails or through interstate commerce identifying them as disseminated by a Communist organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.049" offset="1864098">Its broadcasts and telecasts must be preceeded by a similar identifying announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.517" offset="1898057">This requirement of self-stigmatization applies to all of the organizations, publications and broadcasts regardless of their content.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.398" offset="1945496">Second, it is unlawful for members of the organization to hold non-elective federal office, any office, whatsoever, or employment in any labor union or employment of any kind in an enterprise which has been listed by the Secretary of Defense as a defense facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.611" offset="2050403">These provisions virtually closed the door to all employment opportunities for the members of a condemned organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.775" offset="2091050">Third, it is unlawful for the members to apply for or to use passports for any purpose, no matter how innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.189" offset="2136712">Fourth, it is unlawful for employees of the Government or a defense facility to contribute funds or services to the organization irrespective of the purpose for which the contribution is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.216" offset="2196793">And finally, naturalized citizens who joined the organization within five years after naturalization are subject to the revocation of their citizenship, alien members are to be excluded, deported and are ineligible for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.903" offset="2279549">The sanctions with reference to labeling of publications in literature and broadcasts, employment, passports, and contributions are all enforceable by very onerous criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.442" offset="2345691">In addition, it is important to note that all of the sanctions on the members are imposed solely because of their membership without regard to their personal innocence and also without regard to their lack of personal knowledge of any wrong doing by the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.602" offset="2438374">Sanctions imposed by the Act on the so-called Communist-front organizations and their members differ from most that I have just described only in a few ameliorating details.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.497" offset="2497933">Moreover, --</text>

            <label>Justice Stanley Reed</label>
            <text syncTime="625.750" offset="2502949">Their -- their provisions for destroying your name in the list if you're a member.</text>

          <turn speaker="stanley_reed" startTime="631.590" stopTime="635.572">
            <label>Justice Stanley Reed</label>
            <text syncTime="631.590" offset="2526354">No, I mean, instead of the statement putting your name on the list.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_abt" startTime="635.572" stopTime="891.378">
            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="635.572" offset="2542237">There has been a mistake, there's a lengthy procedure through which you can get your name off the list, yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.371" offset="2577450">In the case of the petitioner, the sanctions on members are not confined to persons who are members by any conventional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.206" offset="2616738">They extend instead to an undefined multitude of individuals who may be found to be members, and I used to put that term in quotes, under Section 5 of the Communist Control Act which establishes such vague and comprehensive criteria for membership in the Communist Party that almost anyone can be found to be a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.026" offset="2724049">Furthermore, a registration order has consequences beyond those I've already described.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.621" offset="2754456">Any person who signs or whose name was listed in a registration statement becomes an obvious candidate for prosecution under the Smith Act or under the extravagantly vague provisions of Section 4 (a) of this Act which denounce a conspiracy and I quote, "to perform any Act which would substantially contribute to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship under foreign control."</text>
            <text syncTime="718.120" offset="2872424">In addition, by branding the organization and its members as reasonable conspirators, the registration order brings down upon them all of the consequences of defamation recently characterized by Mr. John Lord O'Brian as historically the most foul of all weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.084" offset="2964271">Making the members and the organization social outcasts and threatening the members with economic restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.645" offset="3006485">Finally, a registration order makes it prohibitive for other groups and individuals to associate with the condemned organization and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.899" offset="3047549">Or even to advocate legitimate, social or economic views which the latter supports or an addition to the threat posed by Section 5 of the Communist Control Act, any group which engages in such association or advocacy risks condemnation as a front organization or infiltrated organization under the Act's evidentiary criteria for organization to this character.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.415" offset="3169593">Thus, the registration order completely quarantines the organization and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.833" offset="3195298">Worst than that, it effectively deters the whole people from even considering let alone espousing any views which the organization advocates.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.729" offset="3250887">In the light of all these consequences of a registration order, we submit, if the court pleases, that it's idle to pretend as the respondent here does that this Act is a civil disclosure statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.402" offset="3313580">No legitimate disclosure statute imposes disrupted penalties on those who comply with it, nor does a legitimate disclosure statute expose the registrant to criminal and civil liabilities created by the registration statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.532" offset="3406054">The Court has recognized, or did recognize, in the Joint Anti- Fascist Refugee case, that an adverse listing by the Attorney General unaccompanied by any of the sanctions contained in this Act virtually destroys the listed organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.180" offset="3488705">In the context of the provisions and penalties of this Act, we believe it clear that a registration order is tantamount to outlawry.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.364" offset="3541368">But the organization registers as a criminal conspirator that destroys itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="972.891" offset="3891513">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.236" offset="3904888">As I stated, if the organization registers as a criminal conspirator, it not only destroys itself but it jeopardizes the livelihood and the liberty of its members, its contributors, and even those with whom it does business by listing their names for public scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.012" offset="3983987">If a member registers as a criminal conspirator, he destroys himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.289" offset="4009064">Hence, the Act makes and we think was obviously intended to make registration impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.226" offset="4044904">On the other hand, non-registration exposes the officers and members to astronomical criminal penalties for non-registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.402" offset="4085551">The order does offers a Hobson's choice between suicide by registration and governmental execution for non-registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.894" offset="4131527">Far from accomplishing disclosure, the Act compels concealment, the only sanctuary left to the organization and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.433" offset="4177711">The registration order thus results not in information, but in proscription.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.080" offset="4204251">Its function is to outlaw the petitioner, lay a foundation for the mass prosecution of its members and establish a basis for proscribing other organizations including trade unions as Communist-front or Communist infiltrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.722" offset="4282828">In the light of this, the true nature of the Act, its destruction of First Amendment rights, we think, becomes obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.747" offset="4318981">The Act is a crass infringement of the principle that legislation affecting the area protected by the First Amendment must be narrowly limited to some substantive evil that it is -- it is within the competence of the Congress to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.382" offset="4397453">The (Inaudible) of the Act are not limited to the seditious and criminal activity and advocacy described in Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.459" offset="4437786">Instead, the Act proscribes organizations as a whole including all of their innocent advocacy and activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.312" offset="4481149">Thus, in this case, whatever else may be charged against the petitioner, it concededly employs association and advocacy for legitimate, political, economic, and social objectives, many of which are shared by other political parties, trade unions and groups but the Act supresses all of these legitimate activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.030" offset="4596088">It doesn't do so as an incident to the control of deleterious or injurious conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.615" offset="4622420">On the contrary, it is legitimate activity that the Act was designed to reach, for there's already a clutter of criminal statutes on the books which penalize espionage, sabotage, seditious advocacy and provide for the registration of foreign agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.646" offset="4710504">And if Congress per chance has overlooked any conduct injurious to the national security, it could easily make it punishable by legislation narrowly drawn for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.673" offset="4766616">As President Truman stated in his veto message, the Act attempts and I quote, "To proscribe for groups such as the Communists certain activities which are perfectly proper for everyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.841" offset="4827324">In so doing, the Act not only violates the economy principle of the First Amendment, it also violates the proposition that the Government may not intervene in the political process by imposing special disabilities on any one political group and thus perpetuated self in office by handicapping its rivals."</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.286" offset="4937143">The respondent argues that the Act is valid because it strikes at a great evil and Congress could reasonably find that the Communists, the alleged source of the evil are a danger to American Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.909" offset="4995553">The inference from that argument is, that once an organization like petitioner has legislatively and declared to be a danger, all of its advocacy, intellective activity may be suppressed including the concededly non-dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.715" offset="5074860">This justification of the Act rests on an H-bomb theory of congressional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.227" offset="5104849">The theory is, that whenever Congress finds the existence of a danger, it may throw an H-bomb in its general direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.411" offset="5145600">That, of course, is a very easy way to get rid of the danger if one isn't squeamish about the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.897" offset="5187500">The Court, however, putting the Constitution first, has flatly rejected this H-bomb theory in cases which dealt specifically with the Communist Party and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.960" offset="5251762">De Jonge versus Oregon holds that a member of the Communist Party may not be punished for making a lawful speech under the auspices of that organization, not withstanding that as this Court assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.962" offset="5311843">The organization and its members advocate the violent overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.565" offset="5334204">De Jonge, as well as Herndon versus Lowry, established that the right to speak or assemble for lawful purposes may not be abridged not withstanding the fact that the speaker or the sponsor of the assemblage may also be engaged in some illegitimate activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.924" offset="5983608">Although the case arose in a different constitutional setting, we think that the action of the High Court of Australia in striking down the Australian Act to outlaw the Communist Party of that country, demonstrates a sound awareness of the minimum requirement for the protection of a free society against serious appeals to the national security.</text>

            <text syncTime="1527.885" offset="6111504">I said, Your Honor, it arose under a different constitutional setting, but we believe that the Act and or of the opinions, rather, and the opinions occupying an entire volume of the Australian reports are most pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.286" offset="6157061">The respondent does not contest our demonstration that the Act and the order to proscribe advocacy by and association with the petitioner for legitimate purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.359" offset="6201365">Nevertheless, that proceeds to defend the Act as though it were a genuine disclosure statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.467" offset="6225816">In doing so, it simply ignores all of the features which make disclosure by registration impossible and show that it was never intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.597" offset="6270328">In a further effort to escape a defense of the Act, as written, the Solicitor General suggests that the Court disregard the sanctions entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.606" offset="6322364">The respondent urged this position on the court below which rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.123" offset="6340441">For the reason stated in the opinion below, we believe that the suggestion is unrealistic and plainly sound -- unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.432" offset="6385685">Recognizing that the sanctions of the Act are incompatible with the theory of the Act as a disclosure statute, the respondent also discusses them as though they were fully unrelated to the registration requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.827" offset="6439288">We think that this approach is also unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.943" offset="6455693">Nevertheless, our brief analyzes the sanctions individually and shows that each is invalidated by the same advise that condemns the Act as a whole, or none of the sanctions is limited or even reasonably related for the control of injurious activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.713" offset="6550779">Their function individually and collectively is not to protect the national security, but to place a heavy deterrent on the right of association by making the cost of membership and the petitioner completely prohibitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.266" offset="6629042">The Act is condemned by the First Amendment, not only because it proscribes feasible advocacy and association, but also because on it's face and as applied by the Board and the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.228" offset="6692885">Its sanctions are imposed as penalties for the exercise of rights protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.474" offset="6725799">This is apparent in the first place from Section 13 (e) of the Act which instructs the Board to consider eight criteria in determining whether or not an organization is a Communist action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.247" offset="6788911">As appears from an inspection of that Section, a majority of the criteria focused on views, policies and their expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.137" offset="6832483">None of these criteria requires proof of any of the criminal activities attributed to Communist organizations by Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.980" offset="6875847">For example, Section 13 (e) (2) of the Act required the Board to consider the extent to which petitioner's views and policies did not deviate from those of the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.228" offset="6936869">These views and policies need to be neither seditious, dangerous or even false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.241" offset="6960901">They may be patently valid and in the best interest of the American people, yet they provide one of the bases for the imposition of the liabilities and penalties of the Act simply because they are similar to Soviet views and policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.704" offset="7030805">In applying this criterion which the court below characterized and I quote as "furnishing one of the chief items of evidence in the case."</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.074" offset="7068212">The Board rested its finding against petitioner impart on the fact that the petitioner and the Soviet Union advocated such legitimate and widely held views as that the Chiang Kai-shek Regime while on the mainland of China was reactionary and corrupt, that the People's Republic of China should be admitted into the United Nations, that the United States and the United Nations should not have intervened in the Korean War, or that prohibition of the use of atomic weapons as proposed in the Stockholm Resolution was in the interest of world peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.972" offset="7231843">Now, if the Court please, we submit that if the heresy of non-deviation from Soviet use, such as these, can be penalized, then indeed, governmental control over political association and expression is completely unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.821" offset="7303210">In fact the Act's provisions concerning front and infiltrated organizations as well as Section 5 of the Communist Control Act already penalize non-deviation from the views of the petitioner, the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.352" offset="7373322">And it is a common place of current politics to brand as Communist any views of your political opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.700" offset="7414700">This is a technique which was refined and perfected by McCarthyism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.569" offset="7438211">What the Act does is to enshrine it, freeze it into law and arm it with the intolerable sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.229" offset="7476872">Not long ago, President Eisenhower eloquently stated one of the tenets of the democratic creed as applied to the Communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.322" offset="7525251">They are a part of America, he said, and even if they think ideas that are contrary to ours, they have a right to have them, a right to record them, and a right to have them in places where they are accessible to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.653" offset="7590557">It is unquestioned or it is not America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.364" offset="7613440">We submit that in depriving Communists of these unquestioned rights, the Act does and must of necessity deny them to every American.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.080" offset="7668297">Indeed, we believe that validation of the Act and the order of the Board would be a signal to the world that our America has lost its faith in the democratic process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.365" offset="7729424">I come now to the Act's violation of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.608" offset="7762338">The registration order requires petitioner's officers to perform an act, the signing and filing of a registration statement which constitutes an admission of their membership and officership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.890" offset="7835481">The Court has held, however, that such an admission cannot be compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.481" offset="7861917">The registration requirement therefore is a crass violation of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.320" offset="7889189">A majority of the court below held and the respondent argues here that adjudication of the privilege is premature in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.858" offset="7951360">Respondent urges that the privilege must be claimed to be enjoyed, that the officers may never claim it and that those who desire to do so will have an opportunity to assert on the registration form to be filed with Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.056" offset="8028160">This argument overlooks the crucial fact which makes the situation of the officers unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.540" offset="8054073">That fact is that a claim of privilege to the Attorney General is itself an incriminating admission that the claimant is an office of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.661" offset="8102557">The respondent's suggested procedure would give the officers the illusory choice of incriminating themselves by signing and filing a statement or -- or making the same incriminating admission by asserting their privilege not to sign and file a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.702" offset="8190746">Since, under the circumstances of this case, to assert the privileges to surrender it, its assertion cannot be made a condition to adjudication that the privilege protects the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.445" offset="8249678">The respondent also contends that adjudication of the privilege question is premature because if and when the privileges are asserted, it might have be found to have been waived by some of the officers by virtue of prior admissions made by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.478" offset="8321881">We show in our brief, in the first place, that none of the factors suggested by the respondent even if it -- even if they should apply to the particular officers of the petitioner, at the time that registration is required, would constitute a waiver of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.724" offset="8390844">But beyond that, and perhaps more important than that, hypothetical possibilities of waiver cannot be a bar to adjudication of the issue at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.253" offset="8432953">The question of waiver by a particular individual can arise only at the time that that individual asserts the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.725" offset="8470883">But the Act deprives the officers here of any opportunity for its assertion, so questions of waiver can never arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.955" offset="8507768">The respondent also argues that if claims of privilege should be made by the officers and should be honored, the only result would be to make the registration order unenforceable, not void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.122" offset="8568477">This argument rest on the same false premise as the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.201" offset="8588748">Since the Act and the order necessarily violate the privilege by making its assertion incriminating, the Act does not only unenforceable in a particular case but is void on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.059" offset="8652173">We believe, if the Court please, that the decision in United States versus Boyd decisively refutes all of the respondent's contentions and supports the propositions that I have just advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.376" offset="8713404">The statute in that case confronted a suspected tax evader and a forfeiture proceeding with the choice of producing his books to refute the charges against him or suffering the charges to be taken as confessed against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.662" offset="8786547">The Court held that the statute necessarily conflicted with the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.911" offset="8807549">Accordingly, it held the statute not merely unenforceable in a particular case before it but void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.555" offset="8838165">And for the same reason that reached this conclusion without consideration of the doctrine that the privilege must be asserted in order to be availed of and also without any consideration of questions of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.028" offset="8904098">The respondent contends finally on the -- the authority of United States versus White that the privilege is not available to the petitioner's officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.550" offset="8942132">The White case is completely inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.904" offset="8955611">All that that case held was that the officers of an organization are not privileged or not protected by the privilege from producing the books of the organization on the grounds that the contents of those books might incriminate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.438" offset="9025724">Here, we're dealing with a situation where it isn't the contents of the books that are incriminating, but the fact of the officer's position with and membership in the petitioner, and those facts are facts which this Court has held that cannot – admission of which cannot be compelled.</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.736" offset="11446857">Of course, it's true that the Section 2 findings were intended to support the policy of the Act and with no doubt about that, but Congress didn't stop there, it went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.589" offset="11494296">It incorporated those findings into the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.864" offset="11515402">By doing so, it made the liability of a particular organization to register dependent upon the existence of facts which have found legislatively and legislatively only and which the organization is foreclosed from litigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.579" offset="11586247">It does make findings of adjudicated facts and I take it that the respondent concedes that we have a right, that is the petitioner in this proceeding, had a right to litigate all adjudicated facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.848" offset="11643298">If those facts, therefore, are adjudicated facts, the Act violated due process by denying the petitioner the right to litigate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.337" offset="11685303">The Act implies a second device to predetermine the case against petitioner by making the identical findings in Section 2 which -- as it turns up, ostensibly found by the Board in the hearing determine the petitioner's liability to register the Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.246" offset="11788957">I don't have time to analyze Section 2 in order to demonstrate that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.284" offset="11813094">We do it in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.783" offset="11823125">We say that it's perfectly clear from Section 2, from the legislative history and indeed from this Court's opinion in Carlson versus Landon that Section 2 makes all of the findings against the petitioner, the Communist Party necessary for a registration order requiring it to register as a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.504" offset="11925943">It's true that those findings, as distinguished with the -- from the findings with reference to a world Communist movement are extensively to be adjudicated by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.254" offset="11972963">We say that it would be factious to suppose that the Board would make findings contrary to those made by Congress on the identical subject and particularly where the findings themselves are preceded by the statement that they were based on evidence adduced before congressional committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.035" offset="12072124">We say, therefore, that in both aspects, the Act, by predetermining the result against petitioner by fiat violates due process and invalidates the Act as a whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="3824.855" offset="15299396">As the Act was originally written and as it existed throughout the administrative proceeding against the petitioner, the Board's sole function was to identify Communist-action and front organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.551" offset="15358119">Since the amendments inserted by the Communist Control Act, it also has the function of identifying Communist infiltrated organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.166" offset="15400647">Now, Communist-action and Communist -- I mean, Communist-front organization, by definition, depend on the existence of a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.473" offset="15445891">But by definition, the front is controlled by the action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.899" offset="15467520">And it's obvious that you can't have a front without a back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.894" offset="15487478">Now, as the Act was written, as Congress meant it to be written and as -- as it's clear from the whole history and scheme of the Act, there was only one organization that can be held that they -- or that Congress ever contemplated would be a Communist-action organization and that's the petitioner, the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.771" offset="15582981">Certainly, it is beyond dispute that if the petitioner, the Communist Party of the United States, is not a Communist-action organization then there is no other organization that is or can be found so or that as ever been accused of being so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.550" offset="15662184">Now, it follows that if the Board decide and -- decided in favor of petitioner, the first case of the Board, the one case that it -- that was its entire business until it disposed of the case against petitioner, if the Board had decided in favor of petitioner, it would have made the Act inoperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.732" offset="15746926">It would have in effect repealed this because there could be no organization which could have been accused under the Act once petitioner had been cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.901" offset="15791543">The Board, thereby, by deciding in favor of petitioner would have eliminated this entire jurisdiction all future business for itself and with it, the jobs and salaries of the board member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.374" offset="15845460">The Act, therefore, put the Board under irresistible pressure to decide against petitioner and the temptation of self interest to solve this out because it was only by deciding against petitioner that the Board could preserve the Act, could preserve its own existence and could preserve the jobs, the salaries and the patronage power of the board members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.975" offset="15959876">The Board and the Attorney General have always recognized and we cite the evidence of that effect in our brief that a decision by the Board in favor of petitioner would have eliminated the Act, the Board and the jobs of the board members.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.972" offset="16035840">The facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.840" offset="16047334">Now, in Tumey against Ohio, and many cases since, and as recently as the Murchison case at the last term, this Court repeatedly rule that due process requires an impartial tribunal, one that is not subjected to pressure and one that that does have an interest in the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.077" offset="16148271">Clearly, the Act violates this principle for the reasons that I have just stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.913" offset="16171572">Now, the Government doesn't dispute our cases anymore than it disputes our facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.336" offset="16197277">Instead, it tries to slip away from the point by saying that it cannot be assumed that the board members will violate their oaths of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.307" offset="16241162">That's beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.429" offset="16249626">Violation of the oath of office is a standard for impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.545" offset="16266136">It's not the standard for disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.186" offset="16284735">I want to turn now to various questions arising out of Section 13 (e) of the Act and its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.957" offset="16355788">The ultimate issue before the Board was defined by Section 3 (3) of the Act which gives the definition of a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.354" offset="16401345">As Mr. Abt's argument has indicated, this definition has two components, both of which must exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.679" offset="16438648">Stated briefly, the first component is controlled by the Soviet Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.854" offset="16463412">The second component is that the organization operate primarily to advance the sinister and seditious objectives attributed by Section 2 of the Act to the world Communist movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.395" offset="16521509">Mr. Abt has described the findings made by Section 2 on those objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.537" offset="16550139">Now, Section 3 is quite obviously a reasonably clear standard for adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.599" offset="16586292">Nevertheless, Congress set forth in Section 13 (e), eight separate subjects which had directed the Board to consider in making this determination under the clear ultimate standard of Section 3 (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.515" offset="16657972">Now, we analyzed each of these eight criteria in detail in our briefs in a way that I can't attempt to duplicate in our log.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.790" offset="16715128">Our conclusion is that these criteria and the only function that they have is to authorize the ultimate finding under Section 3 (3) to be made on the basis of the irrelevant evidence and criteria authorized by Section 13 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.016" offset="16792033">In other words, to permit the petitioner to be convicted of one thing on proof of another, if this is true, it is clearly a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.117" offset="16840411">We think that we have demonstrated that it is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.632" offset="16858488">In the first place, our analysis of the 13 (e) criteria shows first that the criteria have no relevancy of any kind to the second component of the ultimate definition of the Communist-action organization in Section 3 (3) that is the seditious objectives component.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.322" offset="16953260">The Government points to only one of the criteria, the first as involving objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.783" offset="16987115">But that criteria is not limited to the seditious Section 2 objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.249" offset="17016895">It includes the advancement of any objectives of the alleged foreign principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.383" offset="17045525">It could include the advancement of the objective of cultural interchanges such as working, say to bring the Soviet chess team here or the Soviet pianist Gilels.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.715" offset="17110831">Those things would -- could be evidence under Section 13 (e) of promoting the lurid, terror, rustic objectives described in the ultimate -- and described in Section 2 and incorporated in the ultimate definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.674" offset="17190661">Accordingly, the use of Section 13 (e) permits and authorizes a finding that the organization advances the specific evil objective described in Section 2 without any evidence that it advances these or any other pernicious objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.342" offset="17277283">When we come to the other component of Section 3 (3), the situation is not much better.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.390" offset="17309466">The criteria are either irrelevant to that subject, the subject to foreign control or at most referred to tenuous circumstantial indications of foreign control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.642" offset="17362547">At the same time, they deliberately omit circumstances which might really be material to the question of foreign control, to give one of the easier examples and not to cause for too great analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.463" offset="17429838">One of the criteria of Section 13 (e) is receipt by the accused organization of foreign financial aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.566" offset="17466201">I might say that it's admitted on this record that that criterion was improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.696" offset="17490756">But I'm talking now about the Act on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.915" offset="17503608">Now, obviously, the bare fact of financial aid doesn't have much tendency to prove that the donor controls the donee nor does it prove that one or the other is necessarily bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.316" offset="17557211">Everybody knows that good people give -- sometimes give money to bad causes and even more frequently, bad people give money to good cause, but you can't say that one -- the donor necessarily controls the donee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.873" offset="17619487">Now, both the court below and the respondent acknowledged our argument and they say they agree with us that the really significant circumstances are the terms and conditions, the strings attached, if any, on which financial aid is given and accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.190" offset="17692735">But that is the scheme of 13 (e), it leaves out the really significant question of the terms and conditions of financial aid and just leaves in something that Congress thought might be provable although it wasn't true of the bare fact of financial aid.</text>

            <text syncTime="4446.676" offset="17786671">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.161" offset="17792627">The Government argues that it isn't exclusive and it says that the Board can consider matter outside of the eight criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.389" offset="17829512">Now, I don't know if that's true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.970" offset="17839856">But if it is true, the use of some unlisted rational standard can't cure an Act which directs and authorizes the use of irrational standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.612" offset="17898371">In other words, the most you might have is a decision on a mixture of rational and irrational standard and such a mixture is just irrational as if you left out rational elements altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.256" offset="17953019">Moreover, to the extent that your suggestion that the -- and that the Government suggestion, to the extent that that answer our suggestion that saves the Act on its face, it condemns the application of the Act by the Board, because all you have to do is to examine the Board's report to discover that the Board did treat Section 13 (e) as exclusive and that it did not use the escape hatch which the Government says now is a -- the report takes up each criterion of 13 (e), each of one of the eight separate critera.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.985" offset="18103902">It makes a finding adverse of petitioner in each one and then on this basis and without more, it says petitioner is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.885" offset="18143504">In other words, the Board did convict petitioner of one thing, in Section 3 (3) definition on proof of another on what was utmost proof of another the criteria of Section 13 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.275" offset="18209019">Now, I want to go further, because it happens at -- even 13 (e) was improved, let alone 3 (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.357" offset="18253427">What the board did for lack of evidence relevant even to the irrelevant standards of 13 (e), it had a torture, twist, misapply and misinterpret each of the 13 (e) criteria in making its findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.254" offset="18325002">Now, in the first place, I want to call to your attention that the court below struck two of these eight key findings in basis of the ultimate findings by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.191" offset="18380696">The court below struck two of these eight key findings because they were not supported by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.898" offset="18403579">Those are the findings that the Board made upon reporting and secret practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4606.554" offset="18426149">And the Government's brief makes no attempt, now, to say to justify these two findings which the court below struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.847" offset="18467318">Actually, they all go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.990" offset="18475886">They actually only briefed four of the eight findings, but I'll come back to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.214" offset="18496784">Now, the Board's order was based not on six findings but on the totality of the eight key findings under Section 13 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.377" offset="18537430">Since the court below invalidated two of these key findings, it follows that the order cannot be sustained on the grounds on which it rested and the grounds which the administrative agency made its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.095" offset="18596362">Now, it seems to me perfectly clear, therefore, that under these court's decisions in the Virginia Electric and Power Case and in the Chenery case, the court below erred in affirming the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.491" offset="18649861">At a minimum, it was obliged to remand the case for administrative predetermination and the light of its holding that two of the key findings on which the Board acted were erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.512" offset="18705972">But it's also apparent and this made a remand, although more vital, that the Board misapplied the six remaining criteria of Section 13 (e) even if we forget the fact that the court struck two findings under two of the criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.752" offset="18786952">The Board no longer defends two of its findings under the six remaining after the court's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.928" offset="18815687">Those are the findings on financial aid and on instruction and training.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.235" offset="18836898">Concededly, the practices to which those findings refer, if they ever existed or discontinued years before enactment of the Act, that is clear from the base of the report and that is the reason why the Board no longer attempts to brief the sufficiency of the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.647" offset="18922580">So, now, the Board, having decided against petitioner on the basis of eight key findings is able to defend only four.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.468" offset="18957793">Now, in our brief, we show that these four also were improperly made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.645" offset="18978482">I can't take time to examine all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.200" offset="18992797">I just will briefly examine two of it.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="4751.086" offset="19004291">Which were the four?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="4752.702" offset="19010769">The four was defining on directives and policies which is the first criteria, the finding on non-deviation which is the second criteria, the finding on discipline which is the sixth criteria and the finding on allegiance which is the eight criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.060" offset="19088196">I may say in passing that the common attribute of all those four policies is views and opinions, policies, non-deviation from views and subjective attitude, because the discipline and allegiance standards, as written, referred a subjective attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.416" offset="19165623">Now, I don't want to -- I can't, in my time, cover in detail of all those findings than to all that we've tried to pick up with perhaps one or two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.331" offset="19221316">The first of the surviving findings, the four that the Board defends was that the petitioner acts pursuant to Soviet directives and to effectuate Soviet policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.287" offset="19273143">Now, the Board here met with the difficulty that it couldn't find anything which resembled a foreign directive at any time after 1940 which is the date when the petitioner disaffiliated from the Communist International which in turn dissolved in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.160" offset="19360601">The Board, to compensate for the lack of any evidence of directives in the last 15 years, therefore, invented a theory of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.206" offset="19404800">It said that the so-called Marxist classics, the writings of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, most of them were written before there was a Soviet Union or a petitioner and some written as far back as 100 years ago show from their texts, from their texts that they are Soviet directives promulgated by the Soviet Union to the Communist Party of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.658" offset="19522560">Then it said, since petitioner admits that it thinks these are great books and that it is guided by these books and that it is guided by Marx and Engels and so forth, then, by agreeing with those principles, it is accepting both Soviet directives which are embodied in those books.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.917" offset="19607615">Now, this is obviously a wild distortion of the first criterion of Section 13 (e) that, if it is to make any sense, if it has any constitutional validity at all, must refer to real directives, not to some voluntary adherence to the 100-year-old principles of communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.910" offset="19707611">I might mention the second, the non-deviation criterion, that's the second of the fourth key findings, that criterion, the finding on that was based on testimony that the petitioner and the Soviet Union hold similar views on 44 different issues in international affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.247" offset="19796950">Well, on -- in using the testimony on these 44 different issues, the Board made at least four mistakes of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.425" offset="19833626">By definition, non-deviation is and must be a failure to depart from an already existing standard, the already existing or already established position of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.954" offset="19883781">The Board, however, ruled that it was irrelevant whether the petitioner's view came first or whether the Soviet review came first.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.658" offset="19922547">Obviously, this in itself converted the concept of non-deviation from mere similarity and prevents the concept from having any tendency to prove foreign control or the advancement of another's objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.901" offset="19983569">The second error of the Board in applying non-deviation was its refusal to consider whether the views in question were true or reasonable or accepted by many non-Communist or even that it was accepted as the official policy of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.051" offset="20052114">Now, if non-deviation does have any tendency to prove foreign control, it must be limited to views which are at least distinctive of the alleged foreign principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.684" offset="20102687">Yet, as Mr. Abt pointed out, the Board in making this finding, took into account such widely held and reasonable views -- I see that my time has expired now.</text>
