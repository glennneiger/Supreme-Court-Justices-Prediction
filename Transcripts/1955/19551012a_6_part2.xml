            <label>Mr. Marvin E. Frankel</label>
            <text syncTime="6.539" offset="26122">If the Court please, before lunch, I was reviewing these studies that played an important part in the Commission's decision, studies showing undetected imperfections in eggs given to the carrier for shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.766" offset="94981">I pointed out that in one study there was 3.4% of such imperfection made up of check, stains and only one tenth of one percent eggs was designated as loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.739" offset="150883">I also pointed out that more than half of this 1.9% was a kind of imperfection that could not be discovered by the kind of inspection made at destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.286" offset="209084">And I said that other study showed varying percentages of this kind of imperfection.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.199" offset="236774">Please review it at pages 31 and 32 of the record in the Commission's finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.654" offset="262583">Now, the inspection at destination does not include candling and clicking.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.868" offset="287451">It's a joint inspection by the carrier and the consignee which is purely visual and the Commission's findings also show that at least equal or greater amounts of imperfections of the same kind as those shown in the other tests are undetected at the destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.006" offset="371984">That is to say, after eggs are accepted as being in good order by the consignee with the bad eggs put aside, studies by the Department of Agriculture showed imperfections of the same kind check, stains, dirty, and lost eggs totaling from 3.9% to 7%.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.841" offset="467278">But more the materials before it, the Commission concluded that for eggs packed at points other than the rail point of origin, the 5% tolerance would be reasonable because the damage for which the carrier is not responsible averages that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.720" offset="546795">Now, I emphasize the word averages because it plays a critical part in our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.314" offset="573231">Similarly, the Commission held that the 3% tolerance for eggs packed at the rail point of origin would also be reasonable because of the same theory of averages.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.490" offset="633940">The District Court majority found that this problem of damage and the tolerance regulations issued because of this was a part of the whole problem of rate regulations, and the kind of problem confided to the expertise and judgment of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.643" offset="714501">It found that the Commission findings were supported by substantial evidence and that the decision and the carriers regulations it approved must therefore be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.846" offset="759327">Judge (Inaudible) dissenting, concluded that these regulations were limitations of liability and were therefore prohibited by section 20 (11) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.879" offset="815438">Now, as I've said, we agree with Judge (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="208.807" offset="835187">20 (11) is set out at pages 20 and 21 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.653" offset="862563">And since we think that the statute almost by its terms, decides this case in now favor, if the Court will be indulge me I'd like to read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.151" offset="904568">It says that any carrier subject to the Act receiving property for interstate transportation shall issue a receipt or Bill of Lading therefore, and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.441" offset="969665">A no contract receipt rule regulation or other limitation of any character whatsoever, shall exempt such common carrier from the liability hereby imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.011" offset="1011984">And then, in language which may almost be somewhat repetitious for our purposes, this point about limitations of liability is reemphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.776" offset="1055033">The statute says that the carrier shall be liable to the lawful holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.518" offset="1069976">It said receipt or Bill of Lading of any party entitled to recover thereon for the full actual loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it, again, not withstanding any limitations of liability in any form and then it goes on to say that any limitations of liability in any form in regulation or another form is unlawful and void.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.256" offset="1376967">And Interstate Commerce Commission has so treated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.580" offset="1390237">The Commission has taken as we presented it, the problem whether these regulations issued by the railroad are lawful under section 20 (11).</text>
            <text syncTime="358.934" offset="1435690">It held that they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.863" offset="1443422">And it recognized that the question is, are they?</text>
            <text syncTime="364.823" offset="1459200">And the statute as it's just been pointed to me refers expressly to any rule or regulation or any tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission as not being permitted to contain any limitation of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.837" offset="1535269">And that's exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.620" offset="1542478">They've been variously referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.012" offset="1548016">These are regulations, a pair of regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.187" offset="1560660">They're part of the consolidated freight transportation and nobody has doubted and anytime in this litigation that it if these regulations can't be squared with 20 (11), they are void.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.735" offset="1610919">The whole issue has been, can they be held valid against this sweeping language of 20 (11) outlawing any limitation of liability in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.722" offset="1666821">As a matter fact, two effects of section 20 (11) are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.402" offset="1689600">First, it codifies the common law rule that carry a liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.664" offset="1710602">I think our friends on the other side have some ambiguities in there briefs with their emphasis on the words in 20 (11) "caused by it".</text>
            <text syncTime="437.780" offset="1751040">But there's no dispute really about what "caused by it" means.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.211" offset="1768803">The Commission itself sets it out in its report at page 40 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.921" offset="1791582">That "caused by you", refers to the familiar standard of the liability form carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.997" offset="1823974">That is, the carrier's liable -- I'm reading the Commission's word at page 40 at the record -- for failure to transport safely goods entrusted to its care, unless the loss or damage was due to one of certain causes such as acts of God, the public enemy, the act of the shipper or the nature of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.664" offset="1906625">It is undisputed that when the carrier, when the shipper in a suit for damage to its goods proves that the goods were given to the carrier in good order, that they would deliver in that order and proves the amount of his damage, then the burden is upon the carrier to bring himself within one of these exceptions, acts of God, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.067" offset="2008189">Now, the second point which has been undisputed of which I should emphasize is that section 20 (11) outlaws any limitation of liability in any form whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.525" offset="2062002">And it's been undisputed that if regulations of this kind contain limitations of liability, they are void.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.164" offset="2216647">And there are causes of damage in the transportation of goods for which a carrier is not liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.459" offset="2253740">One of those is the inherent nature of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.014" offset="2263980">If the carrier can show in the particular case against a particular holder of the Bill of Lading that in that case, the damage of that holder of Bill of Lading is claiming compensation for was caused by the inherent nature of the goods, then of course we can see that the carrier is not liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.235" offset="4892839">Therefore, if you left this exception to stand, and if it had any function at all, it would place on the shipper's shoulders, not only the ordinarily undetected origin damage, but also the same kind of damage which is undetected by consignees at destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.779" offset="4987089">Now, the shippers in this case, and their testimony pointed out that it would be agreeable to them, if you could have a system of comparable, fair inspection at both ends of the trip.</text>

            <text syncTime="1598.627" offset="6394462">At page 1165 -- 1165, there is a table showing over the years involved in this case, the net income of railroads from carrying eggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.974" offset="6463843">And very interestingly, it shows with index figures that between 1939 and 1948, when this eastern seaboard problem was drawing and egg damage claims on the eastern seaboard were rising, the net income of the railroad from the carriage of eggs after payment of the claim was 60% higher in 1948 than it had been in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.516" offset="6585992">Now, I don't feel that we have to argue, that we're really equipped to argue in this case that the railroads are getting rich, or going broke on the carriage of eggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.833" offset="6627265">The important thing is that this is not a rate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.376" offset="6641476">You can't answer those questions on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.127" offset="6656418">And if as the Commission says, these averages are valid in rate proceedings, and we agree, then they ought to be presented in rate proceedings, and if the carriers as we think the record makes doubtful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.886" offset="6887445">It cannot be solved, we say, by this use of averages to control every single case, no matter what any shipper can show and preclude every shipper from collecting 3% or 5% of the damage even when he shows in a particular case that his eggs were smashed up by the utter carelessness and negligence of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.807" offset="6987128">Now, this is not a problem for abstract study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.692" offset="7006668">The fact is that the railroads who've been paying these claims before this regulation, that is, recognizing their liability on it, are well able to distinguish between the various causes of damage to particular shipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.707" offset="7150759">And their investigation showed that in such and such a percentage of cases, the damage was due to bad equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.200" offset="7360784">Now, that it seems to us is in its barest and most obvious point a reduction of, a limitation of liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.058" offset="7400176">And in fact, the evidence shows that these tolerances cut the claim by 35% to 40% because the tolerances applied which you see, not as a percentage of the whole shipment but as a percentage of the eggs in the damaged cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.352" offset="7465378">So that if a shipper's claim let's say for 10% of the eggs in the damaged cases, a 5% tolerance doesn't cut the claim 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.837" offset="7511249">It cuts it in half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.467" offset="7517832">And experience working under this kind of tolerance had shown, according to the railroads on their testimony, that the face amount of claim is to cut about 35% or 40% by the application of -- of these tolerances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.930" offset="8035683">Then a few pages later at 884, he said, “So we get down, don't we, to a question of what shall we do as to New York rather than shall we penalize the whole nation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.014" offset="8079987">Well, Commissioner Mitchell never got any answers to his question before this report showed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.406" offset="8101616">And for reasons that we can't explain, the report he wrote to the Commission does penalize the whole nation for a situation concentrated in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.050" offset="8700134">And the railroads experience has shown that the effects of the 5% tolerance is to cut without consideration of liability, the base amount of claims some 35% to 40%.</text>

            <text syncTime="2197.030" offset="8788114">And that this use of the averages to cover every case regardless of what the shipper can show is unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.864" offset="10083370">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.858" offset="10107402">Counsel for appellee railroad and I have agreed upon a division of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.816" offset="10127256">I shall argue the issue of the Commission's jurisdiction to approve the tolerance rules that are here on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.249" offset="10168947">Now, the -- the damage claim problem to egg is not a new problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.214" offset="10192771">It didn't just arrive during World War II, when this counsel says that there was a source of equipment and they were overcrowding the cars, but this is a problem that has confronted the Commission for over 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.068" offset="10244180">As a matter of fact, back, in 1911, the Commission conducted an investigation involving the same questions that's raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.728" offset="10274900">How to reduce the damage claims or to make it possible for the railroad to -- to avoid having to pay claims on property that it didn't damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.611" offset="10318367">And that was the New York Mercantile Exchange Company versus the B&amp;O Railway decided in 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.209" offset="10356820">And then in 1919, the Commission again considered the question of claims on damages to shelled eggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.375" offset="10393496">And that was the case of the National Poultry, Butter and Egg Association versus the B&amp;O Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.195" offset="10420767">And that's reported in 36 I.C.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.092" offset="10432366">And there it prescribed a 5% tolerance rule which is -- is -- which is very similar to the rule that's involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.390" offset="10465489">And that stood the test of time until 1948 when the railroads filed another (Inaudible) with the Commission and -- and proposed to change that rule and so as to include a -- a rule that would cover the damage that occurred during transit due to the inherent nature of these, of the eggs and also to cover the pre-existing damage to eggs before the railroads ever receive them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.501" offset="10577920">Now, that is the history of this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.946" offset="10583771">It isn't something new.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.507" offset="10589936">The carriers that applied their best to solve this problem as is shown in the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.386" offset="10613447">And the Commission's found that despite all of the efforts of the railroad has made where the -- wherein it had used, made test -- tests in -- in connection with the unloading of the eggs in the cars, putting the eggs, placed them crosswise and lengthwise and there were other sets of -- of combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.889" offset="10695471">And but using rubber pads for bunkers and taping the eggs together with -- with adhesive so as to make them a compact unit so as to prevent any vibration or shaking or jolting that would cause them to break.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.107" offset="10748343">So, the -- the Commission found that the -- although that the railroads have -- have done their utmost to eliminate damage to eggs at destination, little improvement could be expected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.383" offset="11937437">Now, of course, the Commission does have that power and it is to be found in Section 1 (6) of the Interstate Commerce Act which requires the railroads in the first instance to publish reasonable rules, regulations and practices designed to cover the -- the delivery, receipt, the transportation and the -- the handling of -- of freights -- of freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.351" offset="12037329">And Section 15 (1) empowers the Commission to investigate any such rule, regulation or practice as is filed by the -- by the railroads to determine whether or not they are reasonable and just.</text>

            <text syncTime="3043.908" offset="12175569">Now, with the -- with this in mind, these provisions in mind, the question is presented whether they are affected by the provisions of Section 20 (11), particularly the clause which prohibit the carrier from limiting his liability in the connection with the safe handling of freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.137" offset="12252473">Now, there was no rule at common law in the first place, that made the carrier liable for damages to goods which the carrier didn't cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.985" offset="12287896">And in order for that damage which occurred during the course of transportation due to the inherent of the goods.</text>

            <text syncTime="4561.993" offset="18247889">The Department took 150 -- 150 carloads of eggs.</text>

            <text syncTime="4587.430" offset="18349662">It refers to Exhibit Number 22 in the record and is at page 1130 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="4606.793" offset="18427089">Now, this same witness conducted another investigation with respect to 737 other cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.580" offset="18458227">And he found that practically substantiated what he had learned from the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.515" offset="18482051">Now, in addition to that, the -- the witness ascertain -- that is, made a comparison of what the damage was, that there were 115 cars at destination as contrasted with what they were at point of origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.252" offset="18544953">And he came up with the difference of additional damage of one decimal 7%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.111" offset="18568359">And I might state that those eggs were all examined in the same way at both ends of the movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.312" offset="18597198">They were both -- there were candled at origin, they were candled at destination.</text>

            <text syncTime="4774.765" offset="19098958">Now, here is a colloquy appearing at page 343 of the record between Mr. Hyman's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.544" offset="19122155">This question that said, asked, you say that it is impossible to eliminate every check in cracked eggs from the case of eggs in the process of creating eggs?</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.814" offset="19223197">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.443" offset="19223092">And then later, Question - You pointed out it was humanly impossible or at least impractical to pack a perfect car -- you have never seen a perfect car have you?</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.153" offset="19222988">No, I haven't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.628" offset="19222883">Question - Then there was a normal expectancy of shell damage in every car that is loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.055" offset="19222779">Is there not?</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.968" offset="19227794">Now, the point before to add about this is that the impression seems to be that -- that there are some perfect shipments of eggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.036" offset="19268127">As a matter of fact, the Department of Agriculture itself allows a certain amount of tolerance in connection with the various grades of eggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.349" offset="19317342">For the double A grade, I believe they allow about 11% and for the so-called A grade about 7.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.486" offset="19357884">Now, that takes in for all types of damages and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.424" offset="19377633">It takes in -- in connection with the double A as I understand it about 5% checks that is, the shell is broken, but the membrane is still intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.664" offset="19426638">So, you see that what we have done and what the Commission has approved is nothing more than what the trade itself does and what the United States Department of Agriculture does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.724" offset="19474808">We try to make something which is in conformity with the trade practices and with what the government itself designed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5195.534" offset="20782080">The fact of the matter is that I suppose there are hundreds and literally thousands of shippers who don't file claims for damage in connection with eggs which existed at the time that eggs were tended for rail transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.306" offset="20849162">Now, if we raised the rates on the shipments of those fellows who look at it let us say from a fair standpoint and don't do like some of this consignees do at New York city and take (Inaudible) smashed or cracked egg that they can find.</text>
            <text syncTime="5232.430" offset="20929620">It isn't fair to the fellow who wants treat us fair to raise his rate because somebody else does something else.</text>

            <text syncTime="5268.239" offset="21072875">Now, let me discuss that phase of it a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.273" offset="21101087">First of all, Judge Powell said to you, "The railroads are permitted to, even at common law, to make the reasonable rules and regulations with respect to receipt of freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.193" offset="21160751">So that fraud and imposition won't be imposed upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.169" offset="21176633">At Section 1, paragraph 6, of the Interstate Commerce Act admonished the railroads to do that very thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.327" offset="21205264">Section 15, paragraph 1, of the Interstate Commerce Act gave the Interstate Commerce Commission authority to determine whether or not those rules, regulations and practices were just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.559" offset="21254165">And then you go to the Section 2 of the Act and you'll find that (Inaudible) shall not be guilty of unjust discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.039" offset="21280078">Section 3 say, you shall not be guilty of undue prejudice or preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.331" offset="21301290">Now, all of those things to my mind must be read in conjunction with the provisions of Section 20 (11) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.058" offset="21348206">Because the interpretation which we ask you to place upon Section 20 paragraph 11 of the Act will do away with discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.328" offset="21385300">It will do away with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.290" offset="21393136">It will assist us, the railroads, in getting away from making involuntary rebates and it will result in uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.594" offset="21434305">And as a consequence, something which has been justified by a record such as this one here of thousands of pages in applied hearings hours of hours both Interstate Commerce Commission and this board of experts certainly ought to be given credence and certainly you want to have the benefit of what was done there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.266" offset="21512986">So that every time some shipper of eggs has lawsuit against this, we may not be compelled to go into court, and endeavor to prove the same type of thing that we too, we hope once for all before the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="6068.638" offset="24274547">The fact is that according to the record, witness Miller and this was the man from the Department of Agriculture said this at page 365 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6082.088" offset="24328255">"These two studies, I think, will show rather clearly at approximately 4% of the eggs as delivered by producers and sold to the first buyers are in a check condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6092.056" offset="24368170">And that an additional 1% was worth of check while traveling from the first buyer to the second buyer."</text>
            <text syncTime="6098.497" offset="24393979">This would mean that when mid-western eggs arrived with the carload assemblers of the plant in mid west area states, or reached wholesale as in the northeast, approximately 5% of them would be checked.</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.906" offset="24447582">Then there are -- there are also further place in his testimony where he said they would also be in those eggs about 12% of stains and dirties.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.012" offset="24483944">Now, in addition to that, there is this statement by the witness from the New York Mercantile Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="6128.740" offset="24514873">He doesn't just say how many members were -- were confirmed as a member for that exchange but they are the dealers in dairy products.</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.478" offset="24545907">And in the old case which Judge Powell referred to many years ago where he said they represented 500 dairy sellers in the State -- in the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="6147.105" offset="24588330">But this gentleman, Mr. Winters, testified at page 634 of the record this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.669" offset="24614661">Please let me -- if you please, let's read this colloquy between Commissioner Mitchell and the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6159.216" offset="24636813">Mr. Mitchell, "You say today you would rather have your eggs shipped to you that are rehandled and repacked at the railway because they come in a better condition.</text>

            <text syncTime="6168.936" offset="24675683">The witness, "We feel so, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6171.735" offset="24686864">We don't want any factors to enter into the field that might damage the eggs, any extra handling."</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.878" offset="24711419">In other words, I suppose you mean that somebody packed these packs of the eggs, puts them on a truck and transfers them 20 miles of the railway."</text>

            <text syncTime="6343.081" offset="25372317">On this question of truck damage, is this -- are we talking about damage as reflected in claims or damage as reflected in damage?</text>
            <text syncTime="6350.667" offset="25402619">Now, the Commission found, I read from the record of 39.</text>
            <text syncTime="6354.137" offset="25416516">The record indicates that in the transportation of eggs by motor truck, the amount of shell damage is negligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6360.871" offset="25443474">And that's based on eight shippers who said they -- the eggs came in on trucks and there was no damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6366.550" offset="25466149">Now, we accessed that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6367.916" offset="25471582">And we think that they must.</text>
            <text syncTime="6370.425" offset="25481613">There are similar findings in the record about plain damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6374.813" offset="25499167">The shell damage is negligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6376.537" offset="25506064">And that simply that some people make claims and other people are generous to the truckers or what not and don't make claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="6383.648" offset="25534589">The Commission expressly rejected that suggestion which -- which is revived here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6388.877" offset="25555487">What we're talking about is shell damage as reflected in broken eggs and claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="6393.579" offset="25574296">They're not simply as an inference from who files claims and who's generous and who doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="6400.846" offset="25603344">Now, our friends have argued that this tolerance regulation ought to be upheld because all it does is relieve them from paying the damage for which they're not liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6410.804" offset="25643154">Now, they don't need a regulation, I believe, in -- from paying for damage for which they're not liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="6487.570" offset="25950250">Now, all of these is based on, Your Honor, is not a law of Chemistry or Physics.</text>
            <text syncTime="6493.697" offset="25974700">As the Commission says exclusively in this report, this is a rule based on averages.</text>
            <text syncTime="6501.397" offset="26005525">Now, you could strike an average with respect to almost any kind of commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6507.846" offset="26031334">If you look at page 25 of the record, you'll find that the railroads break a lot of (Inaudible) with for some reason a great deal of sewer pipe tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.903" offset="26067592">Now, you could get experts to come in and tell about the average amount of sewer pipe or (Inaudible) or automobiles or what not that gets broken for which the railroads are not responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6530.323" offset="26121195">And I take it there is such an average somewhere in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="6533.982" offset="26135928">And then on that basis, in terms of the arguments our friends made, you would have an average.</text>
            <text syncTime="6541.262" offset="26164976">And then you would have the basis for a rule and for uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.342" offset="26181277">Now, we say that that is not permissible under Section 20 (11).</text>
            <text syncTime="6550.720" offset="26202802">Now, if -- I -- I should add this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6553.548" offset="26214191">That what you're dealing with here, after all, is a problem simply of fragility.</text>
            <text syncTime="6559.298" offset="26237179">Eggs are fragile.</text>
            <text syncTime="6560.992" offset="26243866">Tea cups are fragile.</text>
            <text syncTime="6562.785" offset="26251076">For some reason, sewer pipe seems to be fragile.</text>
            <text syncTime="6566.195" offset="26264764">And it's clear as I've emphasized with both the trucks and the railroads, that fragile eggs fragile tea cups get broken to some extent but also don't get broken to a large extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6579.443" offset="26317740">If you sanction this unprecedented effort, then I can see no reason why would sewer pipes, tea cups and everything in the world, there should not be similar tolerance regulations based upon averages.</text>
            <text syncTime="6595.368" offset="26381375">Now, that's never been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6598.026" offset="26392033">As to the suggestion of a settled administrative practice it will of become the, as a government lawyer to doubt the propriety of giving weight to the administrative practice if there is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6611.486" offset="26445845">There isn't any here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.554" offset="26454204">The egg case in 1919, was a case where the railroads proposed general tolerance regulations for egg.</text>
            <text syncTime="6622.080" offset="26488268">The Commission was asked by the shippers to strike them down as unreasonable with no mention of Section 20 (11).</text>
            <text syncTime="6631.007" offset="26524003">On that ground alone, unreasonable then, the Commission struck down those regulations with one narrow and totally unimportant exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="6641.223" offset="26564859">That exception was the so-called current receipts which are run to the next case as they come from the farmer without sorting, there's a certain number of broken, cracked and otherwise damaged eggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6652.343" offset="26609371">As to this, you will see in the Commissions' report the shippers "practically conceded" that the 5% tolerance rule would be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6664.135" offset="26656496">And reasonableness was only issue they had raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="6667.451" offset="26669767">In other words, they in effect, stipulated for a 5% tolerance as the current decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6674.360" offset="26697352">This record show to us current receipts aren't shipped commercially.</text>
            <text syncTime="6678.449" offset="26713757">They are wholly on import.</text>
            <text syncTime="6680.090" offset="26720340">The shippers didn't care about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6682.052" offset="26728176">They won the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6683.563" offset="26734237">Because as all other eggs which are shipped commercially, the Commission then found that such a tolerance rule would be unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6693.411" offset="26773629">Now, there's only one case in the Commission, only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6697.020" offset="26788049">And that is the case involving grain tolerance ruling in 41 I.C.C.where Section 20 (11) is even mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6705.185" offset="26820650">Mr. Justice Frankfurter and I discussed the possible bearing of our argument in that rule and I won't repeat it, except to say that that is the single instance in which the Commission has approved a tolerance rule over the contention that it was forbidden by Section 20 (11).</text>
            <text syncTime="6725.522" offset="26902047">Now, that decision seems to have caused nobody any trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.485" offset="26913855">It's never been reviewed and appears to be unimportant.But that's the only case that counsel on either side has found, that discusses 20 (11) with all the way to where it narrowly accorded to settle the administrative practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6743.890" offset="26975504">We think that this isolated and unrevealed, apparently unimportant decision, doesn't come up to the standard that should be impressive to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6756.511" offset="27025972">I want to ask you to answer the question of Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6759.775" offset="27039033">What justifies the 2% difference between eggs shipped from railpoint of origin and egg shipped from elsewhere, all right?</text>
            <text syncTime="6768.798" offset="27075187">We read the findings, nothing does.</text>
            <text syncTime="6771.611" offset="27086367">The Commission found that the practices of shippers are uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="6775.983" offset="27103922">That in truck transportation, damage is negligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6779.884" offset="27119491">That the egg packed away from the railpoint of origin are truck to the railpoint of origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="6785.604" offset="27142374">In this, we can find no basis with the 2% tolerance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6789.415" offset="27157629">We think the Commission's only findings require that it be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="6795.376" offset="27181453">Finally, in answer to the point discussed with Mr. Justice Frankfurter by Mr. Zearfaus, my information although I don't think it's in the record today, is the serious little litigation over these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="6810.324" offset="27241221">And before they introduced these regulations to, as we see it, limit their liability, the carriers were in many cases paying them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6820.504" offset="27281972">And Exhibit 35 shows that they don't regard this as being a problem with uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6827.257" offset="27308931">Instead, they find themselves perfectly able to determine in many cases that one thing or another, one thing different from another, caused the damage in any particular shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6839.818" offset="27359190">They thought their own report at page 1167 of the records shows that between 1939 and 1948, when these damage claims were rising, the damage caused the eggs from improper handling in trains' yards or stations, increased 15 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="6858.794" offset="27435154">This is their own statistics that damage caused by defective (Inaudible) equipment increased eight times.</text>
            <text syncTime="6867.201" offset="27468800">That damage cause by improper refrigeration or ventilation increased 34 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="6873.338" offset="27493251">Now, they have apparently, in paying these claims on the basis that they are able to make the particular individual determinations in particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6884.794" offset="27539122">The rule now, that regardless of what they determine and regardless what the shipper shows, they are absolutely not liable for 3% or 5% of the damage or 1% plus this very questionable certificate showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6904.128" offset="27616444">That rule, we think, is -- is just inconsistent with Section 20(11).</text>
            <text syncTime="6911.086" offset="27644343">Thank you.</text>
