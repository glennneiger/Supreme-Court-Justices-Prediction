            <text syncTime="18.160" offset="72620">Mr. Davis.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="22.129" stopTime="604.362">
            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="22.129" offset="88503">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.018" offset="96026">This is a criminal case here on certiorari to the Second Circuit after conviction in the District Court and reversal in -- in that Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.145" offset="132493">The single question which the Government, as the petitioner, presents is one of statutory construction of a section of the Taft-Hartley law, the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.849" offset="175334">It involved section 302 of that statute and the -- and that particular section forbids the receipt by any representative of any employees of an industry engaged in interstate commerce or affecting interstate commerce of any payment from the employer of such employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.823" offset="251193">And the question here is when -- when Congress used the phrase in that section, "Any representatives of any employees," it meant to cover the president of the union which was the collective bargaining agent for the employees in that industry in that locality, who was also the negotiator for the union of its collective bargaining agreement or whether Congress restricted its coverage to the union itself, not to any officials of the union or any negotiators for the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.732" offset="378880">The facts of the case are not complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.770" offset="387030">They are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.860" offset="391419">The respondent Ryan was in the relevant years, which were 1950 and 1951, the president of the International Longshoremen's Association, which is a well-known labor union of stevedores and stevedoring employees and longshoremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.672" offset="450664">He was the president of the union and also of its Atlantic Coast District.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.558" offset="466129">He was one of the union's negotiators of its collective bargaining agreements in the Port of New York and he was assignor of those agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.220" offset="500820">The union was the collective bargaining agency for the longshoremen in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.505" offset="517956">And it negotiated with an organization called the New York Shipping Association which was the agent for the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.473" offset="545855">Now, in the years 1950 and in 1951, Mr. Ryan received from two stevedoring operators, two employers in the Port of New York sums -- three times, the sum of $1000, sum $1000 and a sum of $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.928" offset="615654">He received these from these -- received these sums from these employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.906" offset="639582">He was indicted under this section of the Taft-Hartley Act for receiving these sums.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.941" offset="663719">And he was tried by Judge Palmieri in the Southern District of New York without a jury and was found guilty and he was sentenced to concurrent sentences of six months and a fine of $2500.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.984" offset="707918">On appeal to the Second Circuit, the conviction was reversed solely on the following ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.441" offset="729757">That section 302, the particular section involved, relates only to the collective bargaining agent itself of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.574" offset="758282">It does not relate to any of the officials or negotiators for the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.300" offset="773120">Judge Learned Hand dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.245" offset="780957">Now, there are some other questions in the case which the Second Circuit did not go into and if the Government should prevail here, the case would have to be remanded to the Second Circuit for consideration of those questions of whether evidence was sufficient to support the verdict and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.405" offset="845531">The only issue here which we raise is as to the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.089" offset="864340">And as what we -- having gleaned from my statement, the position of respondent is that of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.886" offset="891507">That when Congress said in that section of that statute, "Any representative of any employees," it used the section representative in a technical sense meaning only the collective bargaining agent and not the union officials or the negotiators for the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.972" offset="947827">And, of course, our position is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.662" offset="958589">We rest on both of the text and the context of the -- of the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.090" offset="976353">We rest on its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.164" offset="984607">We feel that if the position of the respondents and of the majority of the Court of Appeals is sustained, the congressional purpose will be frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.780" offset="1015118">And lastly, we do not see anything in the Constitution which should impel this Court to uphold the very narrow and limited construction which the Second Circuit adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.794" offset="1059109">The text of the statute is contained both into the Government's brief, in pertinent portion, and in the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.846" offset="1091291">It's also set forth in the opinion of Judge Frank in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.555" offset="1106129">And we have supplied the Court, I believe, with slip copies of the full text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.647" offset="1134550">Section 302 appears in the slip copies at pages 24 through 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.111" offset="1164434">I'd like to discuss for a moment, if I may, the form of the section because we believe that is a very important key to its meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.459" offset="1197767">It starts out by general broad prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.882" offset="1211455">The first one is a -- a prohibition against the payment by an employer of anything of value to the representative of his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.907" offset="1247608">And the second subsection (b), which is the one involved here, is a correlative prohibition on the receipt by the representative by any representative of any employees of -- of any money from the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.426" offset="1301629">Now, the subsection (c) contains a list of five exceptions from the prohibitions of (a) and (b).I want to stress here, that the entire statute is prohibitory in form.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.775" offset="1355024">That is, it does not to seek to authorize anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.658" offset="1366622">It prohibits certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.497" offset="1373936">Certain things are not prohibited but because of certain arguments which the respondent's counsel may make, I wish to make it clear at the outset that it is not the purpose of this statute to authorize an overwriting of any other portion of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.549" offset="1434122">It's merely a criminal prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.794" offset="1447079">If it doesn't extend to a certain activity, it does not necessarily mean that the National Labor Relations Board could not hold that activity an unfair labor practice in a civil proceeding under -- under or before that Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.159" offset="1496607">It's prohibitory in form.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.133" offset="1504444">And furthermore, the exceptions which appear in -- in subsection (c) are all exceptions from (a) and (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="382.636" offset="1530462">In other words, if (a) and (b) do not cover a payment to a certain person, the exceptions cannot apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.905" offset="1555540">They can only apply if the -- if (a) and (b) do cover the payment.And that -- that I think is very important as I try to demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.812" offset="1587200">So much for the general form.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.961" offset="1595768">Now, the particular words and particular phrases of this statute, "Any representative of any employees," would normally seem a very broad phrase, particularly the word "any".</text>
            <text syncTime="410.946" offset="1643729">Now, does the statute contain any -- any definitions?</text>
            <text syncTime="414.702" offset="1658776">Section 501 on page 29 of the slip copy says that the term "representative" along with some seven other terms used in the Act, shall have the same meaning as when used in the National Labor Relations Act as amended by the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.545" offset="1718126">So that takes us forward to the definitions used in section 2 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.008" offset="1743935">On page 3 of the slip copy, the definition is the term "representatives" includes any individual or labor organization -- any individual or labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.105" offset="1796389">Now, we say that taking those definitions and in their breadth, there is no prohibition or limitation or restriction in the statute on the interpretation of the phrase "any representative of any employees" in its normal ordinary sense, meaning anybody who stands -- represents the employees, who speaks on their behalf, who deals for them, who was their agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.328" offset="1893251">This is the term that -- the meaning of the term has in an ordinary speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.749" offset="1910909">If one goes to words and phrases for definitions of representative in -- in various context in the law that -- that's what one distills from -- throughout -- from the whole body of materials collected there.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.142" offset="1960542">Not only that but in labor parlance, it has that meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.790" offset="1975066">It's somewhat significant, we think, that in the hearings of the Taft bill, which eventuated in the Taft-Hartley law, both the president of the CIO, Mr. Philip Murray and the president of the AFL, Mr. William Green, in different context spoke of labor union leaders as representatives, as union representatives and representatives of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.861" offset="2059389">They were referring to the individual persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.797" offset="2067122">They weren't referring only to the national organization or to its constituent unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.698" offset="2086766">And we think that it's significant, too, that in the grandfather of all labor legislation, collective bargaining labor legislation, the Railway Labor Act and I -- I emphasize this because it's not mentioned in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.781" offset="2135040">That in the Railway Labor Act, it's clear as a bell that the term "representatives of the employees" means the individual persons who do the negotiating because there's a specific section of the Railway Labor Act which says that the representative -- representatives of the employees need not be employed by the character -- by the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.709" offset="2214766">And the carrier is prohibited from trying to influence the -- its employees to select only its own employees as representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.489" offset="2245904">Now, of course, that can apply only to the individuals who are doing the negotiating or the bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.959" offset="2267742">So, we think that if you look at Sections 302 -- 302 (a) and (b) alone with -- with the ordinary view of English that one takes and considering its background in -- in normal public speech and in the particular field with which we're dealing, labor management relationship, it would be pretty clear that when Congress used the phrase "any representatives -- any representatives" in the plural of -- of -- no, I'm just sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.029" offset="2384039">They used "any representative of any employees" that it meant to cover a wide swath.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.653" offset="2402534">They're not to limit it to a particular type of organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.015" offset="2528026">There's no legal about it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="oscar_h_davis" startTime="633.133" stopTime="1044.406">
            <label>Mr. Oscar H. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="633.133" offset="2532519">No, but I think they mean that in referring to a person who is the heir or the -- or the administrator or executor, they want to make sure that -- that if somebody do some back pay for instance that it won't necessarily be refused to his executor.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.419" offset="2601587">Now, leaving the prohibitory sections (a) and (b) and going to the exceptions in (c), there are five in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.458" offset="2637740">The first says an exception for wages paid to any representative and that clearly refers to an individual, only an individual can be employed by an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.276" offset="2677029">And the second says an exception for payments and satisfaction of an arbitration award or a judgment of a court and settlement of a grievance or dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.873" offset="2711406">Well, that too can apply -- is more likely to apply to individuals because individuals rather than unions are the ones most likely to get awards of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.509" offset="2749962">Now, it is conceivable that a union could be covered by that but we think it more likely that an individual would be covered by that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.907" offset="2775562">And the third section says -- the third subsection of (c) says that there's an exception for sale or purchases of any merchandise made by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.307" offset="2813179">Well, it's very unlikely that a union, the collective bargaining agent, will purchase any goods produced by the employer, it's very likely that some officer of the union or representative will do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.959" offset="2863752">In fact, Senator Ball who, I hope to be able to point out, is the father of this legislation said specifically when he was talking about it on the floor of the -- of -- of the Senate when talking about this particular subsection, he said, "Well, of course, we have to have that because many -- most employers, they hope, will be selling their merchandise to business agents of the union, not to the union but to business agents of the union."</text>
            <text syncTime="738.657" offset="2954553">And therefore, we have to have an exception for that kind of transaction between the labor organization and somebody -- I mean between the employer and the business agent of the labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.344" offset="3017352">And the fourth is a check-off provision which of course would apply only to union.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.204" offset="3032816">And the fifth is the welfare fund provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.793" offset="3043161">It's a very elaborate provision providing that payments can be made to the -- by the employer only for the benefit of certain welfare funds, only if certain conditions are met, if there's a joint management and administration by representatives of the employees and representatives of the employers, if it's -- for certain specific purposes such as -- not unemployment but health occupational diseases and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.448" offset="3157786">For the result of this somewhat tedious analysis of the exceptions is that it was clearly intended to apply to a significant number of individuals, not to entities like unions, to a significant number of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.663" offset="3206583">Well, the answer given by Judge Frank in the Court of Appeals and given by the respondent is, “Oh, yes, there are individuals to whom it can apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.484" offset="3233855">But the individuals to whom it can apply are individuals who are designated by the National Labor Relations Board as in themselves collective bargaining agents.”</text>
            <text syncTime="818.198" offset="3272725">They are the only type of people whom Congress meant to cover by these various exceptions relating to individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.852" offset="3299370">I think I will indicate the significance of the position in our -- in a labor relations in United States today of the individual bargaining representative when I tell the Court that the National Labor Relations Board for some other purpose estimated that for the nine-year period, between 1946 and 1954, there were no more than 10 such in the whole United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.117" offset="3388395">And it does strain the imagination to believe that Congress in -- in setting forth these exceptions which clearly relate to a significant body of individual was very much concerned with the individual bargaining representative and feared that courts, if they had an individual bargaining representative who received his wages, would find him guilty of violating the statute nevertheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.115" offset="3476376">And of course Congress is true that if -- if the -- these exceptions relate only to that handful of individual bargaining representatives, they don't have any real place if one wonders why Congress included them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.891" offset="3535517">Perhaps, even more important because we think that it undermines the entire basis of the -- of the argument of the Court of Appeals and of respondent is the effect on the welfare fund provision, welfare fund exception which respondent's interpretation would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.036" offset="3600091">Now, we must concede that the welfare fund provision of the statute was the primary focus of Congress in passing this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.590" offset="3634260">They were interested in limiting and regulating these funds which the unions were, at that time, under the leadership of the United Mine Workers and Mr. John L. Lewis beginning to demand from employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.552" offset="3686191">And it was the primary reason, as Mr. Waldman will undoubtedly tell the Court, why this statute, this particular provision was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.057" offset="3720150">We, of course, claim it was not the only reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.929" offset="3727673">I'll go into that in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.464" offset="3733838">But even if you accept the fact that it was the major reason, look what is the result of the acceptance of the respondent's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.781" offset="3763096">Since this whole section can only apply, including its exceptions, if the payment is made to a representative, it can only apply under the respondent's theory if the payment is made to the union itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.416" offset="3821610">If the employer should make the payment at the request of the leader of the union to the president of the union -- to the president of the union, not to the union itself, it doesn't fall within the exception as interpreted by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.587" offset="3882318">And therefore, all the restrictions and the limitations which Congress was so very careful to impose on welfare funds won't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.477" offset="3909904">There will be no penalty for providing for a welfare fund which has complete employee control for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.102" offset="3940310">And Congress was very careful to make sure that there would be joint control of employers and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.167" offset="3960581">Now, it will be said that the -- the president of the union in that case would be the agent of the union and so forth.And perhaps, the Government, after long series of litigation, would be able to prove that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.087" offset="4004258">But we think that the issue is at best doubtful, you have to prove an agency and if the -- if the employer -- employee representative in our sense, the union leader doesn't deal through the union, you might have a hard time proving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.517" offset="4069982">What I'm trying to drive at is that it would weaken and frustrate the purpose of Congress, the prime purpose of Congress according to the respondent to limit this section to payments to -- to labor union itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.155" offset="4124526">Because the welfare fund provision, which was the important part from the point of view of respondent, will then be subject to evasion and -- and avoidance by any number of a mechanisms.</text>

            <text syncTime="1176.907" offset="4707579">And I think it's very important to deal with that, I think Congress intended to deal with that -- that type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.791" offset="4739135">I've touched tangentially on -- on the purposes which we think Congress had in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.290" offset="4757107">And first, of course, was they wanted to regulate welfare funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.152" offset="4768601">And I pointed out that unless you -- you interpret the word "representative" in sections -- subsections (a) and (b) of 302 to include individuals, you're going to limit and frustrate even that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.759" offset="4818965">And a secondary purpose that Congress had and it's consistent with the -- the general purpose of the Taft-Hartley law is to keep employer influence out of union and employee activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.963" offset="4859820">This is made clear in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.169" offset="4868598">If I can, I would like to go into that for -- in a moment and it's also, as I say, clear from the -- from the breath of the -- of the phrases Congress used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.838" offset="4907259">And I might, in passing point out, that if -- if, as Mr. Waldman would say, the regulation of welfare funds was the sole purpose of Congress, it certainly used a peculiar format to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.932" offset="4947696">The welfare funds is the fifth exception from two very broad prohibitions and it would be a most peculiar legislative draftsman who would attempt to regulate welfare funds in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.677" offset="4994612">Well, the great -- the great argument on the other side is that Congress used in the National Labor Relations Act the word "representative" in a peculiar sense that they used it to mean only the -- the union itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.371" offset="5041424">And we have supplied the Court with copies of the Act in which the word "representative" or "represent" or "represented" underlined so that the Court can see for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.476" offset="5073816">The upshot of all this is, is, is that every single time that the phrase is used in the National Labor Relations Act to revert -- to refer to the collective bargaining agent, it said so explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.378" offset="5113417">There isn't any doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.076" offset="5116238">It says the bargaining representative or the -- the representative, not any representative but the representative of the employees for bargaining purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.540" offset="5170155">And there are -- there are -- I'd say categorically, that the word "representative" alone -- standing alone is never used to refer to the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.573" offset="5282273">It's always qualified by the word “the representative for bargaining purposes” or “the representative as provided in section 9” or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.507" offset="5313933">And there are indications even in the National Labor Relations Act where one could argue persuasively that the phrase covers both the people who negotiate for the union as well as the union itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.245" offset="5356878">Let me give one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.872" offset="5363461">On page 2, at the very end of the statement of policy, it provides that it's the policy of the United States to protect the exercise by workers of (Inaudible) of associations, self-organization and designation of representatives of their own choosing for the purposes of collective bargaining and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.158" offset="5428558">Now, it's very easy to interpret that as meaning not under the union but the people who, on behalf of the union, do the negotiating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.072" offset="5452278">And I would not say myself in that -- in that sense it means only the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.443" offset="5469727">When it means only the union, Congress was more explicit as it is in section 8 and section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.720" offset="5506821">Then let's go to the rest of -- of the -- of the Act, Titles II, III and IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.153" offset="5528555">There, it is sometimes used in the same -- in connection with -- with other phrases as meaning the bargaining agent but it's frequently used in a broader sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.631" offset="5566485">I have time for only one example which I think is very significant and I mention it because it is not in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.030" offset="5588114">On page 24, above right preceding section 302, which is the section we're dealing with, we have a section 301 which provides for suits against labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.047" offset="5636180">And subsection (c) of that provision provides for the venue of suits against labor unions and subsection (2) of subsection (c) provides for the venue in any district in which its duly authorized officers or agents are engaged in representing or acting for employee members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.091" offset="5712353">That's a very clear indication in this statute, in the section immediately preceding the one involved here that union officers or agents are engaged to represent employee -- employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.809" offset="5899180">Section 302 itself, the one -- the one involved here, certainly uses the word "representatives" as meaning individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.229" offset="5924885">On page 25, it talks about the administration of the welfare fund and it requires neutral persons as the representatives of the employers and the representatives of the employees may agree upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.584" offset="6010253">The -- the origin of this section 302 was in the 79th Congress when the Case Bill was being considered by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.159" offset="6048601">At that moment, there was called strike and Mr. John L. Lewis was demanding from the employers a large welfare fund which they said was completely unlimited and to be subject solely to the control of the union and Mr. Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.839" offset="6103353">Senator Byrd introduced the prototype of section 302 as an amendment to the Case Bill at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.279" offset="6169078">It's also significant and this is referred to in some citations in the opinion of the District Court at 23 of the record, not in our brief, that at least four Senators, Senator Overton, Senator Hatch, Senator Hoey, Senator Tunnell talked about the very thing I'm talking about, the -- the separation of the influence of the employer from that of the -- of labor union representatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.951" offset="6683794">Undoubtedly, Mr. Waldman will say that there was a great change in the Conference Committee because there was a special definition, it was -- was originally in the Act which was originally in the Byrd Amendment which is carried over to the Ball Amendment which was dropped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.096" offset="6744294">I will leave for rebuttal my answer to that argument except to say that when the Conference Committee made the change and definition which the respondent and the Second Circuit considers so critical, it said it accepted the Senate amendment with minor clarifying changes and we cannot believe that a Conference Committee which says that it made only minor clarifying changes in -- in a -- in a section of the bill, made the drastic change which it is urged upon this Court and it was successfully urged on the Second Circuit, it was made in this bill.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Waldman</label>
            <text syncTime="1724.304" offset="6897162">It pleases the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.827" offset="6927256">It's already anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.154" offset="6940526">Our position is that the word "representative" used in section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act have a statutory meaning of the concept of representatives of employees is a new concept, a statutory concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.924" offset="7079602">So that it is vague to look to the labor -- to the Railway Labor Act or to colloquially or to dictionary definition to determine what Congress meant in section 302.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.274" offset="7153058">And if we've got to understand this fundamental fact of the word "representative of employee" is not the same as "representative of a union" that even a union is not the same as representative of employees, we shall grasp the significance of the difference between the point of view of the respondent and the point of view of the Government which is a new point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.477" offset="7277819">Now, the -- there is a definition written by Congress in the Taft-Hartley Act which is glossed over here as if it had not been written at all but to which we insist we must advert to determine the clause which the Court has to take in determining the meaning of the word "representative".</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.223" offset="7384816">That clause is written in the last title, Title V of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.194" offset="7412715">It is quoted in full at page 4 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.928" offset="7439673">And by this Section, Congress has said that the term "representative" shall have the same meaning as been used in the National Labor Relations Act as amended by this Act, not as defined as the venerable Judge Hand thought in his opinion but the same meaning as when used in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.863" offset="7599438">Now, then our search must immediately be directed to the manner in which the word "representative" has been used by the National Labor Relation Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.938" offset="7667670">Your Honors will recall of the Taft-Hartley Act, which consists in five titles, has amended the old Wagner Act which had been on the books for 12 years and that is still called the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.789" offset="7731096">The Labor Management Act, which is the Taft-Hartley Act, includes a good deal more than the old National Labor Relations Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.938" offset="7775713">Now, then what is our first step in the quest in determining how the word "representative" is used by the National Labor Relations Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.365" offset="7821375">The first quest is to determine the scheme and the purpose of the National Labor Relation Act as originally drafted and enacted and as amended in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.980" offset="7879889">The scheme and the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act as every student of labor law know was a fundamental departure from the old concept of labor relation in which the union was accepted as the spokesman for its members and a few friends of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.840" offset="7959301">Under the National Labor Relations Act as originally provided in the -- in 1935, a constituency was created, a legal constituency in the same way the congressional constituency or gubernatorial constituency or senatorial constituency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.275" offset="8037042">And we call that the bargaining unit, but instead of defining it in the Act because of the very complex nature of our industrial life, they created an administrative board which -- to which it had given certain criteria by which to determine an appropriate bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.766" offset="8111020">That might be the plant or a craft within the plant or a market or in our case, the Port of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.482" offset="8145920">Once the geographical local is determined by the Board, the bargaining unit who constitutes the electorate, the employee, not members of the union, has nothing to do with the trade union, has nothing to do with union officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.038" offset="8212062">You will search the Wagner Act to find all these arguments that we have heard both in the brief and orally about union officials being interchangeably used with "representatives of employee".</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.634" offset="8262531">The constituencies within the collective bargaining unit become not members of the union but the workers in that unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.475" offset="8301819">Then the Act proceeded to set up machinery for election or designation or recognition, the equivalent of election and it set up governmental machinery to conduct the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.878" offset="8347481">And then the certification and whoever recertified or recognized that the representative of employee then becomes close by federal statute for the first time in our history under the Wagner Act with powers and responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.759" offset="8414981">And then the Act proceeds to in -- create duties on the part of the employer in dealing with those representatives for the union, both the representatives of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.569" offset="8470256">Then there is another principle written in that law which is very pertinent to our discussion in an understanding of section 302, that a representative of employees even exclusive representative, there cannot be, under the law, more than one representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.322" offset="8545280">I'm talking now about the scheme and the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.039" offset="8572134">And that statutory representative elected or designated as I have described, under the law, bargains not for any one group in particular but for the entire group of employees, even if only 51% of the employees has voted for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.029" offset="8652069">It becomes a statutory personality created under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.686" offset="8670668">Now, that scheme will be born in mind as we continue our course into 1947 through the period of 12 years almost from the first moment the Wagner Act became law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.846" offset="8723331">The country will pretty much divide it on the part of industrialist, management, thoughtful students of the problem as to whether or not it is proper to continue this policy of permitting a majority of employees to bind everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.771" offset="8791040">And the struggle was reflected in the form of the union shop and the close shop and preferential shop and a myriad other problems in labor relations, all to the end that a majority of employees shall not bind those who didn't vote for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.467" offset="8857809">That struggle reached the climax in two years in succession in 1946 and 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.651" offset="8890514">In 1946, there was pending in Congress a law, a very controversial law called the case a bill -- called the Case Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.131" offset="8940460">When the Case Bill came on, it was not the labor relations bill, it was not exactly like the Taft-Hartley bill, but it was a bill intended to curve what was then thought to be the excess power of labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.519" offset="9002005">And while that bill was pending, John L. Lewis, with his very great genius for -- for timing his activity, made the demand for 10 cents a ton to be contributed to a welfare fund of the United Mine Workers which the United Mine Workers administered solely, not by any trust arrangement with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.241" offset="9108898">A strike was threatened.Senator Byrd of Virginia proposed an amendment to the case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.632" offset="9138469">That amendment is the one which has called forth a great deal of the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.505" offset="9161979">In 1946, quoted in the Government brief and that amendment proceeded in the legislative row.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.821" offset="9203252">It was changed by way of amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.184" offset="9216731">In the first instance, the Byrd Amendment outlawed welfare and pension funds all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.937" offset="9247660">Later, there was an amendment to permit welfare and pension funds with -- with -- under regulation as -- as called for in that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.091" offset="9288307">And there was a special definition, Your Honors, of the meaning of the word "representative" in that amendment of the Case Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.658" offset="9334596">We quote the special definition in our brief at page 58, "It is substantially the same definition as later found its way to the amendment of the Taft-Hartley Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.114" offset="9456431">When the Case Bill passed both Houses, together with the Byrd Amendment and the special definition, the president at that time vetoed the bill and it failed to receive the necessary two-thirds for reenactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.137" offset="9512542">In 1947, when Congress undertook to overhaul the entire labor relations picture, public hearings were held on the pending bill.Senator Taft was then Chairman of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.074" offset="9588193">But he couldn't muster a majority of the Committee to incorporate what Senator Byrd first provided in the amendment to the Case Bill the year before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.255" offset="9649006">But five Senators, headed by Senators Taft, Ball, and Jenner wrote the supplemental section to the labor report when the bill came on the floor of the Senate in 1947 in which they urged the incorporation in the then Tart -- Taft Act in the Senate, the substance of the Byrd Amendment in the Case Bill which failed the passage in 1946, failed the passage over the president's veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.196" offset="9804696">Then four Senators, not five, although the supplemental report was written by five, headed again by Taft, Ball, and Jenner moved an amendment from the floor, the substance of present section 302 carrying with it a special definition, the same one that is now quoted at page 58.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.902" offset="9895602">Now, under that definition all that the Government is asking this Court to do now would have been accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.598" offset="9942309">They could have had indictments to their hearts content.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.825" offset="9959236">They could have taken civil actions by injunctions to their hearts content against union officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.079" offset="9988284">If you'll read that definition, you will see why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.368" offset="10001450">Now, a very lucid and scholarly speech on the entire Act was made by Senator Morse showing the havoc and the chaos that would be introduced in the entire National Labor Relations picture if an attempt were made in section 302, which was then the Byrd Amendment, by enabling employers to make agreements with minority groups within his plant or within the bargaining unit and by destroying the whole scheme of the Wagner Act which rested on the industrial democratic principle of, one, the constituency had been defined and the election was taken and the majority votes were cast, the representatives was clothed with the power to speak for all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.359" offset="10201339">Now, it is obvious to any labor historian, why if you don't like labor unions or labor or the advance or progress that labor makes, you would seek to introduce, a divisive force into the collective bargaining unit so that the employer, who is unfriendly to a powerful union or a union that's aggressive on behalf of the people it represents, it can play ball with the minority union until it builds it up to be a formal competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.771" offset="10327040">And then, perhaps, replace the other union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.295" offset="10341146">Senator Ives, who is probably among the most advanced and intelligent labor relations men on the Republican side in the Senate, objected to this proposal though sponsored by his own party leadership and voted against the amendment on the floor of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.806" offset="10411154">Then it came up but it passed with this special definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.339" offset="10437277">Senator Ball in a statement to the Senate frankly enough, said of the special definition disagreed and differed from the definition of representative as used in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2629.843" offset="10519301">Then a Conference Committee was appointed to iron out the differences between the Hartley Bill in the House and the Taft Bill in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.887" offset="10555455">Now, the Hartley Bill did not have any part of section 302.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.225" offset="10580846">Senator Ives significantly was appointed a member of that Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.035" offset="10604042">He voted against this proposal with a special definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.954" offset="10627762">Then the harmonized statute bill came out of the Conference Committee, three changes were made in the Taft Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.372" offset="10677394">One, they dropped the special definition, two, they substituted a new definition, namely, that the word "representative" as used in this entire Act including section 302 shall have the meaning and use in the National Labor Relations Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.299" offset="10769136">Now, in the amendments, Your Honors, in 1947 of the National Labor Relations Act, the scheme of representation, the scheme that empowered by statute representatives of a bargaining unit to be the sole and exclusive spokesman for that unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.087" offset="10836323">It was never changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.930" offset="10843638">That remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.234" offset="10848862">The Taft-Hartley law created reciprocal duties that these representatives of employees must act also in a good faith way with employer and management representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.489" offset="10901943">Now, after these changes were made and there's another change which is not significant in connection with our present argument, then Senator, "I won't vote it for the entire law," and Taft-Hartley became a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.909" offset="10955546">It is this text that we are talking about and not the debates that were held on a section with the amendment which was discarded and scrapped and abandoned by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.033" offset="11000059">And what the Government is seeking to do now after seven years of not touching this Act in the manner in which it is now being utilized is to bring back by judicial construction what Congress itself rejected as unsound because it would create havoc in the National Labor Relations law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.787" offset="11079053">Now, how could've it created havoc?</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.620" offset="11086472">Senator Morse pointed it out, I briefly touched on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.951" offset="11103713">Now, we say to Your Honors that after giving you the scheme and the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act which clothed a special legal personality with the name "representative of employee", they come along and this is very a loose kind of talk in labor parlance that Mr. Green and Mr. Murray used the word “representative” in connection with some testimonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.490" offset="11205904">Of course, union officers are representatives of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.631" offset="11222518">And, of course, labor men will say a labor leader is a representative of his union.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Waldman</label>
            <text syncTime="2863.600" offset="11454380">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.514" offset="11458038">And then both Houses adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.799" offset="11467128">So, we are dealing with an entirely different history, a history of deed, not words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.749" offset="11482906">The words don't count here because the words addressed themselves to another provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.760" offset="11502968">Now, we say after the first step in the quest as to how the word "representative" is used in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.724" offset="11534838">What's the second step?</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.595" offset="11542361">An honest search, what did Congress mean by this if we can ever discover what Congress means by any statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.220" offset="11572872">We can only judge it by certain outside objectives, purpose, aim, direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.963" offset="11603801">We are -- we have addressed ourselves to an analysis of the National Labor Relations Act as amended, not in terms of verbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.430" offset="11637656">Verbs don't mean anything here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.252" offset="11644970">We are talking of the noun "representative" as used in sections 3 (a) and (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.659" offset="11666599">You can do an awful lot with verbs but that isn't the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.876" offset="11683422">We are not involved here with the verb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.446" offset="11693767">Now, the noun “representative” in relation to employees is used, Your Honors, 25 times in 16 provisions of the National Labor Relations Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.695" offset="11754684">We set forth in proper numerical order and in the addendum too, all of those provisions in the manner in which the word "representative" is used and in all cases without a single exception, the word "representative" is used in the statutory sense and not in the colloquial or any other sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.423" offset="11857607">And this is what Congress meant in its definition when it said that the word must be as used in the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.734" offset="11886864">That was the final judgment of Congress in its own legislation, shall be as used in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.637" offset="11922495">Now, the Government, by some twist of logic which I can't understand and never could understand from the beginning of this prosecution, seems to say, "Yes, that may be true."</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.680" offset="11970664">That is after it's been pointed out to them in very rudimentary passion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.462" offset="11993757">It's true that the word "representative" means a statutory personality but in -- in the cases we know about, it's qualified by the word "collective bargaining" as subject to this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.105" offset="12040359">Now, there are two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.949" offset="12047778">One is the answer that the Court of Appeals gave and that we have given, certainly both in the Court of Appeals and here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.707" offset="12070766">That is not the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.710" offset="12082782">We cite in our brief and the Court of Appeals cites certain portions of the Act where there are no qualifying phrases and yet the word "representative" is used in the only sense in which it can be used, namely, the statutory sense because it was a new statutory creature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.966" offset="12147775">It didn't exist before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.807" offset="12159164">Now, there's another answer to that.And I think the answer is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.683" offset="12190720">They say that it is used by qualifying language, supposing that's so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.619" offset="12226456">They say "representative” in its context means what the respondent say it means, supposing that's so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.003" offset="12255922">Congress said in its definition 501 that the meaning of the word "representative" shall be as used and if it is used with qualifying words if you find that used in the context, what of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.471" offset="12309838">That's exactly what Congress said shall be given -- the meaning to be given to that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.216" offset="12328856">Now, I can't understand this persistence of thinking that they are making an argument on a statutory construction which is valid when in my opinion it doesn't follow the conclusion which they seek the Court to draw from this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.545" offset="12390087">Now, they make an argument on the analysis of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.494" offset="12409940">I say to you, this Honorable Court, I wouldn't permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.529" offset="12430106">It took two hours to argue to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.172" offset="12440660">But in the brief time that I have, I think I can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Court that even if we didn't have any of these other material, the history and the statutory context and the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.486" offset="12497920">That if you analyze section 302 alone, you will find that the Government is grievously in error, either what the purpose and aim of the section was or what the meaning of the language in that section is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.656" offset="12558524">They're in error because they don't know the facts of labor.Apparently, I can tell that from the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.961" offset="12579840">And secondly, they are in error because they are straining to give a meaning to a statute which doesn't have that meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.783" offset="12611082">Now, what does section 302 do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.961" offset="12619755">What is its purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.801" offset="12623203">What was the -- what do the authors intend to accomplish by that section?</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.898" offset="12639504">Not to purify collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.722" offset="12650789">After all, we are all living people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.405" offset="12657580">We've lived in 1947 and we have lived all the period since and for sometime before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.633" offset="12682449">And it wasn't the purpose of the authors of section 302 to purify the collective bargaining process or to improve labor's picture in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.796" offset="12723096">The purpose of section 302, its broadest purpose was to limit the area and scope of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.043" offset="12756114">It is a very important section of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.644" offset="12770534">Your Honors interpretation of that section has a very far reaching importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.975" offset="12791850">It's -- the authors of that section started out originally by outlawing all territory in collective bargaining by representatives of workers with employers which didn't accept the old copy book standard, wages, hours and immediate conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.905" offset="12875546">But once labor have reached out for pensions and welfare and in time of war since wages -- wage -- raises were frozen, they began to reach out for fringe benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.671" offset="12930612">Research people and scholars and the employer of labor unions began to write about a profit sharing plan and guaranteed wages and all kinds of schemes which labor might aspire someday to make demands on management, be they right or wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.510" offset="12994038">Congress in 1947, under the leadership that then prevailed, wanted to put an end to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.695" offset="13022772">And they said, “We are going to circumscribe the area and the scope of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.360" offset="13049417">And that would be genesis and the meaning of section 302.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.790" offset="13067076">But they couldn't muster enough strength if they intended at that time, at that late date to outlaw welfare and pension benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.785" offset="13111066">They wanted to outlaw checkoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.507" offset="13129979">They finally compromised and settled on regulated checkoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.100" offset="13144398">That's the meaning of one portion of this section.They finally compromised in allowing pensions and welfare but regulating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.846" offset="13179298">But then as Your Honors read the section itself, without any help from me, our brief reads it fairly, fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.611" offset="13222348">Your Honors will find that subdivision by subdivision, section 302 breeds the meaning that it was intended (a), to curve the area of collective bargaining and (b), to regulate welfare funds and limit the checkoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.154" offset="13288594">I see my light is bringing me to a close and I want to say to Your Honors that some of the points that we have briefed here, such as the constitutional question, such as the power of Congress to enact the kind of provision, the Government said this provision means, all of these matters are argued by us in the brief, merely to point out the fact that the statute can be sustained on the basis of honest reading of its history and an honest reading of its purpose and above all, by following the mandate of Congress in the words and provisions they have written for the courts to interpret.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.840" offset="13479288">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.697" offset="13522756">It is clear, I think, both in the argument and the brief and the opinion of the Court of Appeals that the -- the main focus of the argument is that a deletion of the special definition of representative which was originally in the Byrd Amendment and in the Ball Amendment and its -- the substitution of the amendment of the definitions which appear in the Act is given as the reason for the complete and drastic change in the coverage of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.363" offset="13629440">It is true that Senator Ives was a member of the Conference Committee but so was Senators Taft and Senators -- and Senator Ball who were the sponsors of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.812" offset="13667161">Senator -- and it supported it both in the prior Congress and in the present Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.264" offset="13685029">And I repeat that the Conference Committee called it a minor clarifying change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.495" offset="13701956">All -- I think if one -- if -- and they gave no recognitions at all, there was no recognition in the debates after the Conference Committee came in that there was any change in the -- in the substance of -- of coverage of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.899" offset="13827553">The Conference Committee deleted that -- that definition, inserted the word "representative" in the general definition section.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.255" offset="13988989">And Senator Byrd said, "If you think it will do that, I do not.I am willing to have this special definition in."</text>
