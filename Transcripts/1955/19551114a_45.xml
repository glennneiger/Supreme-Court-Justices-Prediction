            <label>Mr. Herbert Monte Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="29.790" offset="119118">This case is here on certiorari from the Pennsylvania Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.520" offset="146077">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania having define to review the decision of the Pennsylvania Superior Court which affirmed the denial of the writ of habeas corpus brought to set aside the conviction that Stephen J. Herman on 27 -- 27 different offenses involving charges of burglary, larceny, and forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.201" offset="232803">The two claims that were raised in the petition for habeas corpus preserves throughout the appeal and now presented to this Court are claims firstly of denial of right to counsel and that Herman was never told of the right to be appointed by counsel, which we contend he had under the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.402" offset="317544">And secondly, the point which my colleague Mrs. Matson shall argue, the fact that the detention of this man incommunicado for 72 hours during which he was physically assaulted and threatened with the resultant plea of guilty amounted in itself to a separate and independent violation of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.193" offset="412735">And that the two factors is taken together, certainly warrant of reversal of the conviction below.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.014" offset="436036">As to the facts of this case, Herman was arrested in September of 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.477" offset="465816">He was a youth of 21-years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.555" offset="474175">He had about six years of elementary school work or an education equivalent to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.933" offset="499670">He was held for 72 hours in a women's quarters of the city jail which in itself might have had some sort of an intimidatory effect, though we won't press that point, was subjected according to the allegations of his petition to a physical assault by police officers during the course of which they grabbed him by the throat and threatened to choke him if he did not confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.825" offset="599249">And threats were made against his safety and the safety of his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.186" offset="616699">He was held incommunicado during this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.422" offset="629656">As a result of it at the end of the three days, he signed a form entitled "waiver of grand jury" an entry of plea and he agreed in that form to plead guilty to three indictments of burglary, larceny, and forgery.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="170.300" offset="681169">In your statement of facts, you're not going give us anything except that is beyond dispute, is that it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="176.888" stopTime="365.389">
            <label>Mr. Herbert Monte Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="176.888" offset="707500">Let me clarify that Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.495" offset="713979">The allegations were made in the petition according to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania in this case and there other decisions, allegations in the petition where there is no hearing held, and there was no hearing held here must be accepted as true unless contradicted by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.833" offset="783256">There were denials of some of these allegations made by the State which we consider to be irrelevant because the cases were disposed of without any hearing whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.478" offset="837904">And therefore, the Superior -- the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania where all came into play that therefore, you must look at the allegations that were made and accept them as true because uncontradicted by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.041" offset="888163">There is only one thing on which we were actually contradicted by the record and that was the state that made him a petition to the effect that this man did not have any knowledge of the charges against him, whereas in fact the charges have been read to him in some detail upon his guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.985" offset="963918">And so, we would want to withdraw and abandon any claim based upon that but everything else was not contradicted by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.115" offset="992444">Every allegation was not contradicted by the record and therefore, must be accepted as true under the Pennsylvania rule and, of course, under the rule of this case being announced in the Superior Court of Pennsylvania's rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.668" offset="1050645">When -- though he had signed an agreement to plead guilty to only three indictments he was actually held for 27 -- 27 different offenses represented by 8 indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.009" offset="1099964">He was taken before the alderman who was equivalent there to a justice of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.193" offset="1124728">And the record in this case is silent as to what transpired before that alderman.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.554" offset="1154194">He late -- he later pleaded guilty in open court and to all of these offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.046" offset="1192124">But, at no time was he advised to the right of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.506" offset="1206021">Now, the reason we consider this to be important is that the 27 different offenses for which he was facing sentence involved a possibility, a maximum potential sentence of 315 years which I would say is substantially more than life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.382" offset="1285433">The offenses were quite complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.468" offset="1297868">We point to our brief -- in our brief to various complex questions of law which the Philadelphia or Pittsburgh lawyer might have been necessary to dig out.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.951" offset="1343739">And we furthermore point out that the man was prejudiced by the failure to have counsel in these regards.He also alleged that he had no knowledge of his right to counsel whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.635" offset="1394521">He stated in his petition that he had -- had one past court experience without benefit of counsel and that he did not know of his right to counsel and was unfamiliar with the requirements of formal courtroom procedure.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="365.389" offset="1461499">How long was the time of that prior plea has gone down?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herbert_monte_levy" startTime="368.894" stopTime="911.050">
            <label>Mr. Herbert Monte Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="368.894" offset="1475500">Prior plea was two years before, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.199" offset="1484696">He would have been 19 at the time and he was given no counsel then.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.067" offset="1504235">The sentencing judge did not advise him at all of the possible consequences of the plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.305" offset="1537149">This was alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.290" offset="1541120">Again, this is uncontradicted by the record as is everything that I say here.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.105" offset="1560346">The District Attorney merely read the indictments or summarized them and the man, his plea of guilty had been recorded already by the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.907" offset="1607576">And also at this particular point or just before this hearing began, the District Attorney, according to the allegation of the petition here, told the man when he showed him the indictments, the eight indictments with the 27 different offenses listed in there, sign your name and forget.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.647" offset="1678524">And of course this isn't reflected in the transcript of the proceedings but, of course, this is something which is not contradicted either by those transcripts of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.565" offset="1726171">Now then, I think in some is really the essential facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.159" offset="1760549">We urge in terms of the right to counsel that this case is absolutely indistinguishable from this Court's decision, a few years ago, in the case of Uveges against Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.544" offset="1830139">Each of the elements relied upon there was here in this case perhaps in aggravated degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.353" offset="1869322">In the Uveges case, I might add that there were no dissents from the theory of the case whatsoever and the only dissents were on purely procedural points as to whether the various constitutional questions had been preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.163" offset="1920627">In our case, as I mentioned, the man was 21-years of age with a limited educational background.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.501" offset="1945913">In Uveges he was 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.623" offset="1958452">In Uveges he was faced with only four District Attorneys' indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.673" offset="1974648">Here he was faced with eight involving 27 separate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.038" offset="1992098">The period of sentence was almost identical in both of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.569" offset="2010175">Again, the claim was made in both cases that there was no informing of the prisoner of his right to counsel and that counsel was not advised, was not offered to him nor was he advised of his right thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.263" offset="2065032">And again, there was a claim in both cases that the plea of guilty was under the direction of the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.534" offset="2094080">Here, we also have physical threats and assault at the first time which was not present in the Uveges case.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.196" offset="2132741">And again here as in Uveges, there was just one instance of prior criminal experience before.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.884" offset="2155520">And again in both cases there was no attempt of the Court to deal with the prisoner by telling him of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.428" offset="2189688">Now, the situation was even more serious here than in Uveges because in this case Herman faced the possibility of 315 years of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.255" offset="2240993">I might explain that under the Pennsylvania practice in determining sentences are given that the minimum sentence can be almost anything but can't accept that it cannot rise higher than one half of the maximum possible sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.645" offset="2318524">So that actually, the sentence with which Herman was faced was between a 157 1/2 years to 315 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.687" offset="2358648">Now arguing, we -- we recognize first -- I -- I trust that I need not to go into the various past decisions of this Court involving the distinction between capital and noncapital cases in which this Court has held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, you must find some ingredient of unfairness and the man's inability to handle the case himself before you could find the violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.031" offset="2472124">I think that under that theory, we have the Uveges case here all over again in a slightly aggravated form so that really, little may be said we said about that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.322" offset="2525205">For myself, I'm interested in pressing upon this Court the theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.451" offset="2549760">I don't know how successful I am going to be, but I think that this is a tenable theory in one which would help the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.379" offset="2581420">This Court has recognized time and time again and I quite agree with it, that it is impossible to lay down any mathematical formulation of the due process rule in relation to questions -- in relation to right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.334" offset="2633247">And of course that is impossible there are so many potential variables that it just can't be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.557" offset="2654145">The Court has laid down only one ironclad rule that in capital cases there must be counsel and you don't go into the question of the amount of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.449" offset="2693747">And we'd enter the amount of prejudice necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.162" offset="2708584">We suggest that the same rule should be applied to cases in which a man faces the possibility of life sentence without possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.936" offset="2763651">That was faced here because parole under the Pennsylvania law, can only begin to run after the minimum sentence has been served.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.060" offset="2808163">So, the man might have found that he go to sentence minimum 157 1/2 years and no possibility of parole until that time was up.So that in effect, this man was facing a life sentence without possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.938" offset="2875664">Now, in the Bute case, the Bute v. Illinois before dissenters suggested and it was indicated in Uveges that a number of the court members felt this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.079" offset="2928222">That in every case where there is a serious offense charge, there must be an absolute right to counsel in State Fourteenth Amendment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.965" offset="2971794">And in Uvegas it was pointed out some members of the Court felt that and others felt only when there where some ingredient of unfairness that was operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.354" offset="3009411">We suggest that one rule of thumb which the Court can lay down, is the rule that where a man is faced with the possibility of a life sentence without possibility of parole, which I shall call an absolute life sentence for purposes at least of argument that in that case too there is a requirement of an absolute right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.542" offset="3110139">We attempted, John Finerty and I when we handled the case of Williams against New York before this Court, attempted to press upon it there that there was a distinction between life imprisonment and execution and that when a court deviated from the jury's verdict and gave a death sentence of the jury had recommended life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.279" offset="3217032">We argue that there was such a difference in the quality of the punishments that there was a requirement of a full hearing with the right to cross-examine -- cross-examine on the basis of probation and police reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.090" offset="3268336">This Court rejected that contention.It refused to make that distinction there between life imprisonment and the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.104" offset="3308356">What I now urge upon the Court is that the Court refused here to make the same distinction and adopt as a rule of thumb the idea, the rule of law that a person who faces a life sentence without possibility of parole must have an absolute right to counsel.There have been cases before this Court in which a man faced a life imprisonment though it was not clear whether or not there was a possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.558" offset="3430191">I had been unable to find any indication at this point that I'm urging upon the Court now was ever pressed upon this Court before.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.544" offset="3470106">We think it has validity because in either case a man's life was forfeited to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.136" offset="3496542">In either case the charges against him are of course of the utmost seriousness, either in that totality or singly.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.234" offset="3528934">In either case the man is faced with spending his life in jail, a living death or to be executed in one short moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.735" offset="3566864">And I might say that the chaplains of the (Inaudible) for example have told me that those who have lived to face absolute life sentences after their death sentences were commuted have in all cases said that they would have preferred the electric chair.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.995" offset="3623915">And we suggest that those persons are entitled to the same protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1446.005" offset="5783928">I -- I might say on that that you have for example the case of Palmer v. Ashe, where after quite of a few more years, when we had in this particular case, 15 years after sentence, the man brought a motion to set aside the verdict on habeas corpus and it was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.573" offset="5870237">And there was a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit a few months ago not cited in our brief, the Morgan case in which the Court of Appeals in New York -- U.S. Court of Appeals of New York pointed out that time could not possibly cure a void sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.214" offset="5944842">And that the least that of State or Federal Government could do would be to set aside the particular conviction after it was found to have been void, that there was no way of restoring the time that a man had spent in jail on a particular offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.334" offset="6017254">So that there is absolutely no authority for stating that the delay in filing the habeas corpus is any reason for denying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.975" offset="6059886">The dissenters in Palmer v. Ashe thought that the factor of delay plus improbability of a lot of other allegations and failure to allege a lot of essential points that all of those states take it together might have been ground for the decision of the Pennsylvania courts and after justify it constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.247" offset="6152986">That of course was the view of the dissenters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.954" offset="6171794">And I might say that even with some members of this Court inclined to follow that dissent that there are numerous gestations between that case and ours, making ours a fortiori case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.405" offset="6221531">The example on that case, there was no complexity of charges that the uncounseled defendant had to face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.327" offset="6249221">In this case he had to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.203" offset="6256744">In that case, there was no allegation of incompetency to conduct the man's own defense at the time of the trial and the dissenter said that the court below had the right to assume competency in the absence of a contrary allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.721" offset="6310870">This was the dissenters, the majority said no even to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.506" offset="6326021">In our case, there was an allegation of incompetency ti conduct the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.944" offset="6347755">And this allegation was denied, that there was no denial again of the -- not by the record but by the District Attorney and there was no denial here of the right that the man did not know that he had a right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.323" offset="6401254">Also, in the Palmer v. Ashe case the man involved had never denied committing the crimes for which he had been sentenced whereas in this case before you, Herman has denied committing all of the crimes for which he was sentenced except one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.669" offset="6474606">And I think perhaps most importantly in the Palmer v. Ashe case, there was no allegation there that the man in question did not know that he had a right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.829" offset="6515252">Here, we have an allegation that Herman did not know that he had a right to counsel and this allegation stands uncontradicted, even by the District Attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.854" offset="10451383">Since this question of Pennsylvania law on right to counsel in noncapital cases is currently before us, I'll start with just a moment on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.088" offset="10492343">Our Appellate Courts, both the superior and Supreme Court have held that rather there's no absolute right to counsel in Pennsylvania in noncapital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.465" offset="10533825">If there are any special circumstances in which ingredients of unfairness appear, then the person has a right to have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.386" offset="10573531">And in several cases, that principle has -- has been applied and there has been found to be a denial of the right of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.872" offset="10615432">On this other point before you, this is not the principle point because it becomes important only as it ties in with the question of the denial of counsel at the time of the taking of the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.980" offset="10671856">That if in the point which have raise is in reference to the way in which this defendant was handled from the very moment that he was taken into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.872" offset="10719399">The petition for the writ of habeas corpus alleges and it is not denied, that he was held incommunicado for 72 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.054" offset="10760150">When it came to the allegations of the physical abuse or threats to himself and directed against his wife and child, the District Attorney's Office denied that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.757" offset="10802991">Their denial of course cannot under the decision in this case be given any particular effect because the Court announced the Pennsylvania rule very clearly here in its opinion when it said that, "If there has been no hearing then any allegation properly pleaded in the petition not be accepted as true."</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.830" offset="10887314">To see a great deal of -- of this problem would have been removed here and we might not be here before you if the lower court has seen fit to grant a hearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.772" offset="10939037">But I think that you will perhaps understand why we didn't get a hearing when I refer to some of the time element involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2816.019" offset="11264000">This was a rather peculiar thing but the Washington County has a rule of Court, which says that the name of local counsel must be endorsed on every paper filed in their Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.900" offset="11859592">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.842" offset="11863353">We rely upon the following things as evidence of ingredient of -- of unfairness entering into the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.778" offset="11895014">In the first place, like this man was only 21-years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.879" offset="11915494">He had had only six years of formal education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.147" offset="11936496">He had only been in trouble once before at which time he did not have counsel, it was not a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.338" offset="11961260">It was a plea entered in exactly the same way as this one was entered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.569" offset="11982263">And therefore, he alleged that he had no knowledge of his right to -- to have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.394" offset="12013505">When it came to the question of what he should do when he got up there in the courtroom having previously signed of what was called a "waiver of grand jury" agreeing to plea -- plead to three offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.882" offset="12063451">This was in fact at which he desperately needed counsel because he was suddenly confronted with eight indictments containing 27 counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.721" offset="12102844">He was not permitted to -- to read these things or have been explained to him, first he signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.784" offset="12127086">Then he was brought up before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.105" offset="12136385">And this is the normal practice and there was nothing unusual in that in the way it is handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.788" offset="12155089">That is the plea was signed right there in the courtroom probably while another case was going on and that then, the defendant having signed would be brought before the bench to -- to be disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.872" offset="12207438">In addition to these factors, the fact that he had been compelled to sign this confession back on September the 8th after three -- after 72 hours of being held incommunicado and questioned, and assaulted, and threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.538" offset="12274103">If -- if Herman had been able to handle this situation if he'd had counsel, he would have known at the point when he got up there and found that he had entered a plea to 27 different offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.939" offset="12323736">That this was the time to say, "No, Your Honor, I didn't do these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.323" offset="12345260">I only did one of them and I pled guilty only because I signed the waiver rather in the confession because I was threatened and abused and mistreated."</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.215" offset="12388833">But he would have had to -- to take that step there in the courtroom with State Police Officer James Wright at his right hand with a judge who was obviously angry over his being in there a second time, under circumstances where very few people of even superior intelligence would have enough courage to get up and say, "Everybody in this Courtroom except me is wrong and I want to tell you that judge before you send me away."</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.049" offset="12496144">Well, of course Herman didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.665" offset="12506593">The fact that once he had -- had entered his plea that he was taken advantage of by the Court and -- and this is a very serious charge that it seems to me that the things which we have pointed out indicate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.245" offset="12560927">The fact that the judge who had before him the record showing he had agreed to plea to three offenses then to sentence him on 27 offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.079" offset="12608261">Why -- why shouldn't this judge have inquired as to this sudden multiplication of charges from -- from three up to 27?</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.877" offset="12643474">This was something which put the Court on -- on inquiry, it seems to me, and the Court failed to -- to make an inquiry and sentenced him on cases where it was obvious that no case could have been made out if this man had been put to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.055" offset="12704183">So that all of these things constitute the ingredients of unfairness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.172" offset="13420669">The Superior Court which handles most of these cases because appeal in habeas corpus go to the Superior Court and you almost never are able to get the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to allow (Inaudible) so that essentially, the Superior Court is the court of last resort and the one that passes on -- on these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.752" offset="13494962">And they have said whatever may be the effect of the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Turner (Inaudible), we are bound by the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.281" offset="13537071">Now, that was their language, it's quoted in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.443" offset="13549714">And they then proceed in -- in most of the situations which has arisen to deny that holding, a part from incommunicado for as long as 15 days has anything to do with rather the confession was voluntary or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.324" offset="13613244">And they have -- have in effect ignored the requirements of the decision in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.581" offset="13646263">Now, it isn't vital to the decision of the Herman case, that Your Honors look into that point at all except that it may have some bearing upon whether there shouldn't have been a hearing here to determine what the facts really were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.533" offset="13698090">But it is present in Pennsylvania decisions and perhaps, they ought to have a little bit more respect for the decisions of this Court.</text>
