            <label>Mr. Richard P. Tinkham, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="43.685" offset="174707">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.629" offset="190485">This case is before the Court on writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.023" offset="220056">Jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action is based upon diversity of citizenship in as much as all of the petitioners are resident of Wisconsin and the respondent was an Iowa Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.337" offset="281287">The petitioner is John M.Petrowski and Grace Ringle, have brought this action originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.536" offset="306051">They were very seriously injured in an automobile accident which occurred in Wisconsin on September 27th of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.845" offset="339278">They started their suit in the District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin by series of a summon upon the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of the State of Wisconsin, pursuant to a power of attorney which had been executed by the respondent and filed with the Commissioner's Office authorizing service upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.668" offset="422661">After the suit was started, the respondent moved to dismiss the action and quash the service, taking the position that that service of process was not valid under the power of attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.809" offset="475220">The District Court overruled that motion, and then, subsequently, after the case has been issued, the respondent moved to interplead the other petitioners' named, Francis Gelhar and Ruth Petrowski.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.918" offset="547631">They were made parties of this lawsuit at the request of respondent who stipulated in writing to jurisdiction of the District Court the same as if and I am quoting “personal service had been obtained” and a counterclaim for a declaratory relief against those particular inter pleaded petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.645" offset="630491">The question before the Court today, deals with jurisdiction in persona.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.761" offset="654942">The District Court proceeded to try this case upon the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.695" offset="674691">Evidence was presented, and made findings of fact and conclusions of law in favor of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.309" offset="705202">The key question on the merits of the case which involved coverage under an insurance policy issued by the respondent was whether a restrictive endorsement attached to the policy, which denied to coverage to any person who is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, unless he was the named insured where I remember the name insurance household.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.892" offset="799556">The validity of that particular restrictive endorsement was the question on the merits, and also, whether or not it was in effect at the time of this accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.950" offset="835709">The District Court held in favor of the petitioners, finding that that restrictive endorsement was not in effect, that it was invalid, and made findings of fact that the conclusion of law in favor of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.964" offset="887850">Then, the respondent appealed this case to the Court of Appeals and besides raising the issues on the merits of insurance coverage at the time of the accident, again, raised the issue of jurisdiction over the respondent's corporate person.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.152" offset="952529">The Court of Appeals in a two-to-one decision, a majority of the Court of Appeals held that there was no jurisdiction in the District Court by a reason of the servers of process upon the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles under the power of attorney and reversed the District Court, solely upon the issue of jurisdiction and persona.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.618" offset="1042390">We have petitioned this Court and certiorari was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.534" offset="1058064">Now, briefly, the questions presented are first of all, whether the power of attorney was valid and gave to the District Court through the service of process upon the Commissioner, jurisdiction to try the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.887" offset="1115533">And secondly, and irrespective of the answer of the first question, did the respondent, by its affirmative actions after the case had been issued, waive any jurisdictional question and did it not stipulate, in writing, to jurisdiction an as the case proceed in order that on quoting the stipulation that there could be an adjudication as to all parties injured in this accident upon the issues of insurance coverage to avoid a multiplicity of lawsuits and to make that determination res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.468" offset="1253773">I'm quoting from the stipulation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.801" offset="1263177">It's our position that, of course, that was a waiver of any jurisdictional question and gave to the District Court jurisdiction to try the lawsuit.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="324.950" offset="1299749">Is there any reservation in the stipulation of the jurisdiction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_p_tinkham_jr" startTime="329.773" stopTime="515.076">
            <label>Mr. Richard P. Tinkham, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="329.773" offset="1319079">No, sir, there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.309" offset="1325140">The only reservation was made and I will read that to the Court or call the Court's attention to it very shortly, A reservation that they reserved the right to dispute the coverage of the insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.867" offset="1371429">They denied that there was any coverage in force at the time of the accident, but the stipulation expressly states that they submit to the jurisdiction of the Court the same as a personal service had been obtained one upon the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.337" offset="1429316">Now, turning briefly to the facts, in 1950, the respondent which is an Iowa Corporation filed a power of attorney in question with the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.237" offset="1488875">Now, that power of attorney I have set forth in full at pages 4 and 5 inform the important points I have put out in full at pages 4 and 5 of the brief for petitioners, and I respectfully call the Court's attention to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.246" offset="1548957">That was filed in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.846" offset="1555331">This accident happened in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.497" offset="1565884">There is no dispute about the fact that the power of attorney was still in force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.720" offset="1586782">As a matter of fact, it has never been rescinded or repudiated in any way by the respondent and I am informed it is enforced at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.182" offset="1620637">Now, the Court will notice that that power of attorney states very clearly at page 4, as I have cited and quoted in my brief, the Hawkeye-Security Insurance Company hereby applies to have its safety, financial, responsibility notice of insurance recognized as evidence of insurance of non-registrants in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.611" offset="1710393">I might stop right there and explain to the Court, that Wisconsin like most of the other states of the union and also the State of Iowa where this particular contract was issued, have a Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.667" offset="1770580">That law provides that if a motorist is in an accident, unless he deposits security to cover the damages to the people involved, he will lose his driving privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.133" offset="1816451">The owner of the car will lose his license plates, and if they are non registrants of the State of Wisconsin, the right to operate on Wisconsin highways unless they have a policy of insurance by a corporation licensed in Wisconsin or if not licensed who has filed a power of attorney, such as we have here filed by the Hawkeye-Security Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.531" offset="1918119">Then, we also have the financial responsibility as part -- part of the law, which provides that if a person has had his driving privileges suspended because of an accident, he can get those privileges back by having a policy certified and filed to prove that he has financial responsibility where he will then be a safe risk driver up on the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.858" offset="2007353">Now, the important part of the power of attorney, I believe, is contained in paragraphs 2 and 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.109" offset="2036402">The Court will notice that paragraph 2 states that the governing executive authority of the Hawkeye-Security --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="515.076" offset="2060225">From where are you reading?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_p_tinkham_jr" startTime="516.452" stopTime="866.395">
            <label>Mr. Richard P. Tinkham, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="516.452" offset="2065763">From page 4 and 5 of the brief for petitioners, Your Honor, that the governing executive authority has duly adopted a resolution, providing that its policies are varied to comply with the laws of this State relating to the terms of motor vehicle liability policies it should vary under 85.09 of the Wisconsin statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.159" offset="2160536">I might say that there is no dispute, but under the Wisconsin statutes as construed by our highest Court in Wisconsin, any restrictive endorsement such as the type here attempted to be placed upon this policy by the respondent is void.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.372" offset="2229394">And it is our position that under the power of attorney, the respondent has elected as to any accident that happens in Wisconsin to vary its policies so its terms will comply with the requirements of Wisconsin to protect Wisconsin's persons' injured in such accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.370" offset="2293447">And next is the part of the power of attorney, paragraph 5 dealing with the appointment of the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.430" offset="2321659">And if the Court will read that in the succeeding two paragraphs it would become very apparent that it is an outright appointment of the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles of Wisconsin as the agent for the respondent for service of process as to any -- any action arising out of a motor vehicle accident in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.586" offset="2410266">It is our position that clearly this was such an accident, it had happened in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.363" offset="2433358">This is an action to enforce the liability of the respondent, insurance company under the policy of insurance which it had enforced upon the current question at the time of the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.886" offset="2483513">Now, in the brief of respondents, they take the position that this is not an action arising out of a motor vehicle accident, but this is an action upon a judgment, which of course it is, but the judgment was obtained because of the injuries in this accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.458" offset="2553731">Also, I want to point out that the petitioners could not have brought suit directly against the insurer to determine the liability of the insured driver because of the standard no-action clause which was contained in the policy, which prohibits persons injured from bringing a direct action against the insured and the insurer to determine the liability under the negligent laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.055" offset="2668147">Therefore, they in effect are saying that the power of attorney would never be in effect and we would never have a right to sue them, and that of course I believe cannot be the intention of the power of attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.942" offset="2715690">Now, the particular policy here involved was issued by the respondent in Iowa on May 7th of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.165" offset="2756650">The respondent had previously covered the same insured who was a boy named Meehan.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.201" offset="2780787">While Meehan was still in civilian life, covered the same car, the original policy had no such armed forces restricted endorsement as was contained in this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.658" offset="2830629">However, that policy had lapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.837" offset="2839301">Mr. Meehan had gone into the armed services and was then a Corporal at Chanute Field, Illinois and he came back home to get his car and got this new policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.226" offset="2876813">And solely because he was then a member of the Armed Forces, the respondent added the restrictive endorsement here in question to the policy which denies coverage to anyone else operating the car who was a member of the Armed Forces unless he is a member of the immediate family of the named insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.351" offset="2957375">Now, Mr. Meehan and the Corporal, Francis Gelhar, who is also one of the petitioners here and who seems to have and does have under the District Court's decision a declaratory judgment declaring that the policy was enforced and covered him.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.222" offset="3020800">In July of 1951, these two boys were buddies at the airfield in Chanute, and they decided they would trade in Meehan's old Chevrolet and get a newer Pontiac automobile together and they jointly purchased the new car.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.429" offset="3081613">They paid for the down payment jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.461" offset="3089763">They paid the various insurance premiums, including this policy's premium was contributed to equally between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.941" offset="3123722">As soon as the new car was purchased, the -- the boy, Meehan, wrote to the agent of the company who was a cousin of his incidentally in Iowa and told him in effect, “Francis Gelhar and I have bought this new car together and I'd like to have the policy transfer to cover him as well as myself and to cover the new car.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.279" offset="3217032">Upon receipt of that request, the agent immediately notified the home office of the company and a change of car endorsement was issued and that was in turn sent directly back to the boy, Meehan which changed the coverage to the car that was in fact involved in this accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.919" offset="3287667">Now, there is a claim and there was a claim upon the trial that there was other correspondence between the agent and the assured, named insured Meehan to the effect that we cannot cover you if you are going to have someone else on the car with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.584" offset="3350256">However, the District Court found upon conflicting evidence that no such correspondence took place and that the only correspondence that was held between these parties was a notification of the agent of the joint ownership and the request for joint coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.283" offset="3413055">And the reply back, it wasn't reply at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.275" offset="3421100">It was rather the change of car endorser which is Exhibit 4 in the volume of exhibits, changing the coverage to the new car which was then jointly owned by Gelhar and Meehan.</text>

            <text syncTime="944.584" offset="3778247">Subsequently, the boy, Gelhar who was also a Corporal at this air base was home in Wisconsin on furlough, and of course he had the car with the knowledge and permission of his co-owner and the accident happened there and these people were badly hurt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.355" offset="4213342">Thereafter, when the case was at issue, the respondent wished to have all of the parties who were injured in this accident before the Court so that the adjudication on the issue of insurance coverage and the validity of the restricted endorsement would be binding upon all persons who were injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.425" offset="4285649">Therefore, it moved the Court to interplead and to issue on amended summons bringing in Francis Gelhar and Ruth Petrowski as additional parties to this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.654" offset="4342596">Ruth Petrowski did not want to come into that lawsuit at that time, but because the respondent agreed to let her take judgment in this action for the full amount of the balance remaining available under the policy of insurance and the limits of that policy and by stipulation, she took a judgment against the negligent driver, Francis Gelhar for the balance remaining available under the policy of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.438" offset="4441652">And it was stipulated in writing by the respondent at that time, and I call the Court's attention to that stipulation which is set forth at page 8 and 9 of my brief, stipulated as follows and this was on file and it was a part of District Court proceedings before the trial commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.057" offset="4516153">I'm quoting, “That each of the parties to this stipulation voluntarily submits to the jurisdiction of the above entitled court without service of process herein, the same as if personal service had been obtained by each against the other.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.097" offset="4580310">I want to emphasize that the interpleader and the bringing in of all of these parties was at the request of that respondent, so that it would not be faced as the stipulation states, with a multiplicity of lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.827" offset="4631301">And so, that, as the stipulation states, this action could determine as to all parties, the issues on the merits of insurance coverage so that it would res judicata as to both the respondent and each of the petitioners who were injured in the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.972" offset="4703817">So, it is our opposition that they stipulate to jurisdiction and waive the question they have previously brought before the Court on jurisdiction in personam for the reason that they wanted to bring in all of these parties and have the action decided now rather than having some of the petitioners go to Iowa where admittedly the venue would like and where of course the interpleaded plaintiffs could have gone, had they desired to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1298.863" offset="5195442">In conclusion, the petitioners take the position first of all that there was jurisdiction by the service of the army commissioner under the power of attorney in the very clear terms there set forth, but that in any event, the respondent, thereafter, for its own purposes and for its own advantages to avoid as it's stated a multiplicity of lawsuits, agreed that this action would be the basis for determining all questions of insurance coverage upon the merits and that the District Court has made findings of fact and conclusions of law which were no way set aside by any determination of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1431.511" offset="5726041">If the Court please, I would like to fill in a few more of the facts of this case, which have not been brought out by counsel for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.231" offset="5760836">This is a case that involves liability under an automobile liability insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.237" offset="5792914">The policy contains a provision by reason of his endorsement that it should not be in effect if the car were driven by any member of the Armed Forces other than the name insured or while the name insured is in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.477" offset="5857907">Now, I would like to bring out the facts regarding the negotiation of this policy which led to that endorsement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.648" offset="5902524">This policy was written in May 1951 and Your Honors will recall the Korean War started in the summer of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.082" offset="5932304">As a result of that war and the step up and the draft, a number of automobile liability insurance companies evoked this type of policy, refused to write policies on servicemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.634" offset="5978488">The result was that the Hawkeye Company received a flood of applications from young men who were entering military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.454" offset="6009731">So, the actuarial department wrote a bulletin to its various agents in which it pointed out that the company wanted to only insure known risks, and because of the great incidents of accidents that led from one serviceman lending his car to another, the actuarial department felt that it was wise to consider whenever writing a policy for servicemen, whether or not there shouldn't be a restriction to preclude the lending of car to another serviceman or to preclude coverage in case loss occurred as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.393" offset="6153509">Accordingly, when Mr. Meehan applied to one of the Hawkeye agents for insurance, the agent told him that the company was not anxious to write policies for servicemen, but the agent said, “I think the company will accept you if you agree to this restriction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.047" offset="6228114">And the -- and Mr. Meehan signed a written statement that he agreed that in consideration for the policy being issued, the insured should not in effect if the car was driven by another serviceman while Meehan was not in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.644" offset="6310557">Accordingly, the actuarial department of Hawkeye approved the application for insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.712" offset="6334798">They felt that they were able to give Meehan the civilian rate, premium rate with this endorsement in the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.927" offset="6363638">In other words, from an actuarial standpoint, they believe that this exclusion equalized the rate to a civilian rate and as a result, Mr. Meehan got a very low insurance rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.007" offset="6428003">Now, when the -- when the new car was bought in July 1951, I understand this company's policy first covered a Chevrolet car owned by Meehan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.038" offset="6472098">Two months later, Meehan having since gone to an Air Force Base in Illinois, having left Iowa, he bought a new car with his fellow serviceman, Gelhar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.317" offset="6525179">And Meehan wrote to the insurance company, to the agent and said, “Would you please change this policy now so that the insurance will cover my co-owner?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.022" offset="6568020">The agent wrote back and said, ”We cannot do that, but if you were to have a co-owner who is another serviceman, you better turn in your policy, have it canceled and get out other insurance at your base.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.785" offset="6623086">Meehan, however, was anxious to get insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.781" offset="6635102">He couldn't get his car on the base without insurance, so on receive of that letter he merely sent only the description of the car and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.010" offset="6659971">He didn't say anything about whether or not a fellow serviceman was still to be a co-owner, and the agent assumed that Meehan had abandoned the idea of having another serviceman and put through this change of car endorsement, which amended the policy to provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.349" offset="6725381">It should cover the Pontiac car instead of the Chevrolet car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.096" offset="6748369">Meehan -- both Meehan and Gelhar -- I might say that Meehan is not a party in this case, never was a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.379" offset="6777417">Here, you have an action brought by persons who are strangers to the contract of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.279" offset="6801032">Meehan has never complained about his policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.225" offset="6812839">He never has filed any -- voiced any complaint that the policy is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.269" offset="6833006">This is entirely persons who are strangers to the contract entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.522" offset="6854008">The Hawkeye Company has never had any negotiations with any of the plaintiffs in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2717.439" offset="10869656">That is that in order for the Court of Appeals to find no jurisdiction, it first had to find this policy restriction was valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2746.524" offset="10986057">Now, the policy restriction is valid and I submit the ultimate decision of the Court of Appeals is correct, mainly that the complaints should be dismissed against the respondent, insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.825" offset="11027226">Now, my argument on this comes rather under the Wisconsin Safety Responsibility Act, the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.081" offset="11072261">That Act does not require persons who drive cars in Wisconsin to carry automobile liability insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.438" offset="11133701">The Act has two portions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.328" offset="11149270">First of which is the safety responsibility portion, and that comes into play when a driver has his first accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.290" offset="11185110">And if he -- if the accident involves injuries of a certain extent, he loses his driving privileges unless he has in effect an insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.645" offset="11242580">The Wisconsin Act permits unlicensed insurance companies to have their policies qualify under this law, provided, they file this power of attorney with the Motor Vehicle Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.607" offset="11294407">However, the Act provides that only if a policy is in effect at the time of the accident, does it qualify as to relieve the driver of suspension of his driving privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.213" offset="11360758">Now, in this case, the policy contained a restriction, which by its terms, resulted in the policy not being in effect when this accident occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.249" offset="11404957">Consequently, the Hawkeye Company, under this power of attorney, was not required to file a certificate that insurance was in fact covering his accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.291" offset="11445081">And that is the reason that the Hawkeye Company did not certify this policy under the Wisconsin Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.688" offset="11470681">Now, if the -- if this endorsement had not -- had been invalid, then the policy would have been in effect because the policy by its terms, taking this endorsement out, covered anyone driving with the owners' permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.967" offset="11551765">Consequently, the Court of Appeals had to decide that this endorsement was valid that the policy was not in effect at the time of the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.326" offset="11589277">In order to decide that the power of attorney did not apply, and that is -- that is the -- my argument here that even though this Court may disagree with the Court of Appeals on jurisdiction, even though you may say that the respondent here stipulated himself out of the jurisdictional defense, nevertheless, the ultimate decision of the Court of Appeals is correct that the policy restriction was valid and that therefore, the complaint against the defendant should be dismissed.</text>
