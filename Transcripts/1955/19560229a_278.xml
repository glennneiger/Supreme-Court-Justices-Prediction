            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="38.433" offset="153704">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.781" offset="163109">The -- this case which is really two cases consolidated was instituted by the Secretary of Labor to enjoin the three respondents from violating the minimum wage and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the suits were brought against just two of these respondents, King Edward and Budd companies and the May company intervened on the ground that the same issues in fact and law are similar issues of fact and law were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.750" offset="314932">Our three plaintiffs operate tobacco-bulking plant in Quincy, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.148" offset="340532">The cases present several issues relating to the very complex exemptions in a Fair Labor Standards Act for employees engaged in farming and practices incidental to farming and to certain agricultural operations and one of the sections, which is not raised here, a third one relates to certain processing operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.136" offset="464457">The three -- the three sections with which the cases is primarily concerned are printed in the separate appendix of the Government and starting on page one.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.583" offset="526315">And I think I should briefly point out the differences in those sections at the background to the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.410" offset="561633">The agriculture exemption with which this Court has some familiarity, it was concerned with that in the Waialua case last term, is a complete wage hour and child labor, minimum wage, overtime and child labor exemption for farming and this Court described their practices which are really incident to farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.771" offset="662988">The Section 13 (a) (10) exemption is also related to operations that are -- but which are performed on agricultural or horticultural commodities and it is also from the minimum wage and overtime provisions not the child labor however.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.928" offset="763611">But it is restricted to the operations -- operations carried on within the area of production as the defined by the Administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.901" offset="803527">This Court has recognized that Section 13 (a) (6) is related to the agriculture exemptions as the two were designed to meet to equalize the situation between the agriculture exemption, their farming activity and operations which -- which might be close to the farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.172" offset="908643">Now, it does -- Section 13 (a) (10) does include some processing operations but not the word processing which we think is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.377" offset="941453">It doesn't include processing generally, but it does specify certain things which are processing operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.854" offset="975412">Section (c) which is the other exemption in 7 (c) which is the other exemption in the Act which has something to do with operations on agriculture on agriculture commodity, Section (c) -- 7 (c) is just from the overtime provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.923" offset="1047615">That is not the minimum wage.</text>

            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="274.631" offset="1098501">This is an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.569" offset="1102263">These are all three exemptions which has some relation to agriculture or agricultural operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.281" offset="1129117">But 7 (c) is -- is quite different from the agriculture exemptions which is 3 (f), the definition, quite different from that in Section 13 (a) (10).</text>
            <text syncTime="294.091" offset="1176346">Section 7 (c) has -- is just from the overtime as I state and it is full of the word “processing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="303.920" offset="1215634">We think that's quite significant and I'll come back to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.589" offset="1230263">The other two sections have nowhere used the word “processing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="311.489" offset="1245936">Section 7 (c) is just full of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.649" offset="1258580">And Section 7 (c) so far as agricultural and horticultural of commodities are concerned also limits the exemption to the area of production as defined by the Administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.114" offset="1320438">Now, the two other exemptions, the ones that were commented on by this Court in the Waialua case, their purpose is to exempt things that are essentially farming or practices incident to farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.269" offset="1385012">I think the legislative history makes that clear that that was the purpose and although Section 13 (a) (10) did cover some other operations and some processing operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.046" offset="1428167">The apparent reason for it was because there were some representation that sometimes those things were performed that -- frequently that they were characteristic of farming activities enclosed to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.126" offset="1488457">In Section 7 (c), on the other hand, which is just the overtime exemption, is not particularly concerned with farming.It is frankly and candidly a processing exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.833" offset="1539239">It is not particularly concerned with farming and its purpose was not to -- was not particularly for farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.154" offset="1572571">Its purpose was to relieve processes, the processes there mentioned, of the overtime provision during peak seasons of their operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.507" offset="1618024">It was not peculiarly concerned with -- with farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.934" offset="1635683">Now, the reason we think that is important, the significant of that, is that if the exemption is construed, as the court below construed it and respondents urged here that it'd be construed, the agriculture exemption in 13 (a) (10), then 7 (c) is meaningless because the other two exemptions, they have a complete exemptions from overtime and minimum wages, and Section 7 (c) which covers processing operations gives only an overtime exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.328" offset="1773296">And if those processing operations are included under either one of the others, there would be no rhyme or reason for Section 7 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="452.799" offset="1811122">Now, to get back to the facts in this particular case, all three of the respondents here operate tobacco-bulking plant in Quincy, Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.538" offset="2010070">Well, its just -- that's just from the overtime and its very carefully restricted and I might point put that the area of production definition is in 7 (c) (2) for -- for horticultural and agricultural commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.836" offset="2059285">Some of the other things are exempted without reference to area of production, but the horticultural and agricultural commodity is all subject even in 7 (c) to the area of production definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.669" offset="2130651">The three respondents here are all operating so far as physical characteristics of their plant and their process is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.779" offset="2175060">Their plant, their tobacco-bulking plants are all pretty much alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.241" offset="2204944">Those plants process, what is known as Type 62 Sumatra tobacco, which is used exclusively for cigar wrappers.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.738" offset="2254890">That type of tobacco, like all of types of tobacco, requires some pretty extensive curing.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.888" offset="2283520">This type requires to somewhat different kind of curing and fermentation, but our tobacco require some -- some kind of very long term curing when it comes from the farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.640" offset="2342557">This type of tobacco is -- has to be a special agent called (Inaudible) pick and it is put it in the barn as it's picked and goes through a preliminary barn curing process which is, as -- as we read the evidence on it and the expert description of it, it's primarily a drying operation wherein the moisture content is reduced between 85% and 80% down to 25% to 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.327" offset="2477244">When it reaches a -- the stage where it is ready for the bulking plant, the farmer takes it to the bulking plant and this tobacco is located, I think, from 13 to 30 miles from the various bulking plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.773" offset="2538998">It all comes within a 30-mile distance from the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.488" offset="2565851">It's taken by the farmers to the bulking plants which is located in the town of Quincy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.979" offset="2591869">The bulking plant is a large scale industrial plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.279" offset="2613081">It's not a simple adjunct like a farm or like barns or like silos or packing ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.518" offset="2645995">The respondent's description which seems to imply the contrary is plainly refuted by their own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.295" offset="2685179">Respondent, Budd, asked for an admission of fact and we are somewhat surprise that their assertion that this -- that the plants do not require tremendous amount of industrial machinery because they specifically asked for an admission -- requested an admission, and I'm quoting, “That tremendously large amount that these plants require a tremendously large amount of valuable and expensive equipment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="700.267" offset="2801058">And that's on -- on -- in their request for admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.212" offset="2824777">Now, the Government objected to admitting that because we said we didn't know what the facts were in that respect at the beginning of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.705" offset="2862811">The Court overruled the Government's objection and that was left and then -- then the Government admitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.599" offset="2886322">So that is undisputed that these -- these plants require a tremendously and I'm quoting, “A tremendously large amount of valuable and expensive equipment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="731.582" offset="2926237">Now, it suggested that that would not apply to the other two respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.861" offset="2943373">The trial court found otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.620" offset="2950478">The trial court found that these plants judging from the description of the process and from the similarity of it that there was a sufficient evidence to -- to infer that the same kind of equipment was required in all three of the plants and I think from reading the -- virtually identical affidavits of the various respondents as to the nature of the process, it will become evident that -- that that is true of all three plants and we have put in our supplemental appendix a quotation from the Department of Agriculture bulletin which specifically states that this type of -- of operation does require large scale equipment and that is why it's usually done as an independent large scale business by the bulking plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.225" offset="3200836">Now, the bulking process itself requires the placing of the leaves in bulks of some 3000 to 4000 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.264" offset="3261022">This much is needed in order to retain and generate sufficient heat for the sweating and fermentation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.829" offset="3299265">It's obvious therefore that the ordinary small farmer is not in a position to do that bulking on his own tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.086" offset="3344300">It requires, according to the admitted evidence or about 100 -- not less than 100 acres or not much less than 100 acres a year, to acquire that much tobacco to put in the bulking process.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.326" offset="3413264">The bulks must be -- the temperature of the bulks must be closely controlled and watched at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.293" offset="3449104">The whole process is quite an extended one requiring from six to 12 months or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.831" offset="3475226">It's the bulking process.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.158" offset="3484630">It requires the breaking down and rebuilding of the bulks at regular intervals every six or eight days.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.148" offset="3512529">The piles -- the bulks are turned completely inside out, although in a sense, and I might mentioned here too that the Budd request for admission also asked for an admission, that above all this process requires a skill -- special skill and experience that I mentioned that point in connection with the contention that this is ordinary farm labor which I will come back to later, although in a sense, this is -- there -- the bulking process is somewhat a continuation of the barn curing process because it's believe that some of the fermentation starts in this preliminary barn curing.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.365" offset="3717433">The process is very obviously quite a different one.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.933" offset="3739690">It requires quite a different sort of control machinery and skill.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.504" offset="3769992">I might also point that entirely different wage scales are maintained for the bulking plant employees from what is maintained for the farm labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.472" offset="3821819">The fact that the farmer does not ordinarily do this for himself is -- is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.857" offset="3855360">There some 300 growers of this type of tobacco in the -- in the neighborhood of Quincy and only five or 1.6 operate -- 1.6% operate bulking plants which bulk only their own tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.951" offset="3947729">The three respondents, as I say, all their plants are all engaged in pretty much the same operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.187" offset="3980748">They differ in this respect that Budd purchases all of the tobacco it bulks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.383" offset="4005512">It grows no tobacco itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.043" offset="4016170">The respondent King Edward and May in the plants involved in this litigation, bulk only tobacco grown -- their own grown tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.722" offset="4062877">King Edward, although in the plants that's in this litigation, bulks only its own grown tobacco in that plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.886" offset="4091507">Also operates two other plants in which it bulks tobacco or purchased from other farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.551" offset="4122122">And the amount of tobacco it purchases from -- from other farmers that it bulks is substantially greater than the amount of its own that it bulks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.006" offset="4167993">So there's no question that King Edward is also engaged in a large-scale tobacco bulking business which we -- we think the fact show is separate and apart from its farming operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.515" offset="4225985">The -- all three respondents in the court below claimed that they were exempt on the both, the agriculture exemption and the 13 (a) (10) exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.180" offset="4848640">Assuming they are, they still would not be entitled to the exemption if the Administrator's definition of area of production is valid because none of the three meet the area of production requirement of the administrative definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.491" offset="5053962">So that if that is valid, then definitely the respondent Budd is not entitled to any exemption even assuming its operation is one of those mentioned in 13 (a) (10).</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.273" offset="5117074">Now, the other two respondents would not be entitled to that exemption, but then the question is whether they -- they can exempt under the definition of agriculture on the theory that this bulking plant operation is really an incident to farming.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.277" offset="5485087">The only difference, I would say that could be found in the two cases, is it that there was an express mention of sugar milling in Section 7 (c) which the Court suggested might make that sui generis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.428" offset="5541616">But I think the -- the general opinion in the Waialua case would certainly a fortiori lead to the conclusion that hereto this is not a mere incident to farming And that certainly, it -- it's analogous in the sense that this Court has held that the mere fact, the mere fact that the grower is processing only his own crop is not enough to make it agricultural.</text>
