            <text syncTime="142.560" offset="570201">And a similar statement is contained in United States versus Rosenberg in the Second Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.257" offset="729025">Here, the question was not raised until present counsel raised it some two years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.689" offset="766746">He now makes a statement that it was where the Court sua sponte to move to change the venue.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.718" offset="866847">Further, our Constitution provides that the Court shall have the power to change venue under the provisions of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.674" offset="2270668">We say it is difficult to determine how there was such an out of court campaign in view of the fact that Exhibit 42 contained on page 998 (a) of the record concludes that if these defendants are sent away for impressive periods, it should discourage forays into the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.582" offset="2354260">If -- we submit -- if it was an evidence of a campaign to get the death penalty, the statement to send away for impressive periods has no -- no meaning.</text>
