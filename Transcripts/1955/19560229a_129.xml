            <label>Mr. John J. Yowell</label>
            <text syncTime="19.196" offset="76696">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.486" offset="89861">This appeal is for an order of the three-judge District Court in the Northern District of Illinois, dismissing for one of federal jurisdiction, a suit to enjoin the enforcement of the Illinois Community Currency Exchanges Act on the ground that it is repugnant to the equal rights such Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.841" offset="223295">The material allegations of the amended complaint, which were supported by findings of fact of the District Court or – or admitted in the answer to include to following.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.101" offset="304379">That the action of course arises under the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 1, that the amount in controversy, which this Court said in the Gibbs case in 307 U.S. which is cited in the appellant's brief, is the value of the right to conduct the business prohibited by the challenged statute, exceed the sum of $3000 exclusive of interest and cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.238" offset="412944">And the plaintiffs, Doud, McDonald and Carlson, constitute a partnership doing business under the foreign name of Bondified Systems, that the defendant -- that they're all citizens of Illinois, that the defendant Hodge is a duly qualified and acting Auditor of Public Accounts of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.351" offset="505313">The defendant, Latham Castle is a duly qualified and acting Attorney General of the State of Illinois, and the defendant, Gutknecht as a duly qualified an acting State's Attorney of Cook County, resided in that County in the Northern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.275" offset="561006">That's submitted on the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.828" offset="571246">That the partnership is organized for the purpose of, intends to engage and has been engaged not in the ordinary business of a currency exchange, but exclusively in the business of selling and issuing money orders under the firm name, “Bondified Systems” in Cook and other counties in the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.611" offset="670407">That is supported by finding three, page 509 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.619" offset="694439">Then, follows a great deal detail as to how the plaintiffs came to get a license to sell this -- this particular kind of money orders and how they happen to operate as a partnership and not as a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.137" offset="752536">And then, at page 13 of the record is the allegation as to the provisions of the statute involved, which the statute of course is submitted in the answer, page 27 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.917" offset="811572">The Act is an act in relation to the definition, the regulation and licensing of community currency exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.707" offset="842815">It's also ambulatory, so-called ambulatory currency exchanges which are not here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.651" offset="866534">The statute purports to regulate the business -- I'm reading from the amended complaint, purports to regulate the business of a community currency exchange which is defined to be, one, a person, firm or a corporation engaged in the business of providing facilities or cashing checks, drafts and money orders for a fee or service charge or other consideration or, two, engaged in the business of selling or issuing money orders in his, there or its name or any other money orders or, the third classification, engaged in both such businesses subject to certain exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.863" offset="1055451">At page 14 of the record, the complaint -- the amended complaint further alleges, “The statute likewise specifically exempts from a definition” -- I should say at first it exempts state and national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.551" offset="1110204">The statute likewise specifically exempt from the definition of a community currency exchanged, all persons, firms and corporations engaged in the business of selling or issuing United States Post Office money orders, American Express Company money orders, Postal Telegraph Company money orders, understand those two are now merged or Western Union Telegraph Company money orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.547" offset="1226188">In other words, the exemption is not only the Post Office, United States Post Office which is, of course, a federal instrumentality, the Western Union Telegraph Company which is regulated by federal law, and also the American Express Company money orders, which is not subject to any regulations whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.372" offset="1313437">The said statute contains the following provisions, regulating the business of the community currency exchange, no person, firm or corporation which is not exempted from the definition of a community currency exchange shall engage in the business of selling or issuing money orders without first securing a license to do so from the Auditor Public Accounts of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.266" offset="1413016">The said statute further provides that a community currency exchange shall not be conducted as a department of another business that it must be an entity, financed, and conducted as a separate business unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.760" offset="1490965">It is then alleged that this classification is unconstitutionally broad in that, one, the American Express Company operates its money order business in substantially the same manner in which said plaintiffs operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.117" offset="1564421">That is supported by the Court's finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.821" offset="1579259">Two, there's a conclusion that the exemption of the American Express money orders is unwanted, not germane to the purpose of the statute and highly discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.583" offset="1634325">Then the allegation that the American Express Company is an aggregation of individuals operating under a joint stock company plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.099" offset="1664313">It is not a corporation but an association of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.890" offset="1679464">That's submitted in the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.068" offset="1688242">The answer also admits that the American Express Company sells and issues money orders in the City of Chicago, Illinois through operators of drug and grocery stores, such operators retaining a portion of a fee fixed by the American Express Company for the issuance of its money orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.119" offset="1764415">That is submitted in the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.036" offset="1772042">The answer also, admits that no statutes in the State of Illinois provide for any regulation by any law, a Board Commission or a regulatory body of the operations of the American Express Company in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.298" offset="1825123">It's also admitted in the answer, the American Express Company does not operate under any franchise, granted to the State of Illinois and said, "American Express Company is not subject to regulation by any regulatory body from the State of Illinois, and the American Express Company agencies in issuing money orders are in direct competition where the operations by the said plaintiffs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="482.257" offset="1928986">That's supported by the Court's finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.990" offset="1947899">There is then this allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.173" offset="1960647">The defendant -- this is at page 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.341" offset="1973290">The defendant Orville Hodge, Auditor of Public Accounts of the State of Illinois, the defendant, Latham Castle, Attorney General of the State of Illinois, and the defendant, John Gutknecht, States Attorney of Cook County, Illinois have threatened that any attempt by plaintiffs to operate the business of selling and issuing money orders under their firm name, either through offices wholly owned and operated by them or by means of operators of drug, hardware and grocery stores as agents of the plaintiffs or by both such means will bring down upon plaintiffs action by said defendants in the Courts of the State of Illinois to prevent such continuance of such business and for the enforcement of the provisions of State of Illinois, Community Currency Exchanged Act by criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.334" offset="2173283">That, at page 29 of the record, is this admission and the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.160" offset="2220617">They admit they threatened to enforce the said statute against the plaintiffs, if the latter violated the same, but alleged that said threats were general and specifically, and not specifically directed against any particular conduct of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.860" offset="2299402">That at the time they made said threats, the plaintiffs have either not violated the said statute or these defendants were not apprised of any violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.065" offset="2348199">That these defendants were not informed of any such violations until the amended complaint informed them of the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.275" offset="2385084">That these defendants have thus far, taken no legal steps against the plaintiffs to enforce the said statute, and since this suit has been pending in the United States District Court, no proceeding has been brought in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.882" offset="2463451">The state courts have not now required no jurisdiction over the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.974" offset="2487798">Now, that's the first count.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.118" offset="2500441">That's by the three plaintiffs constituting this partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.885" offset="2523533">They're the ones that alleged that they have this license from the people who have copyrighted and have certain forms that they sell for the purpose of selling this money orders, a system of making reports and -- and keeping records etcetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.979" offset="2623843">That was one agent in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.785" offset="2635128">In other words, there was a justiciable controversy, it wasn't just someone saying --</text>

            <text syncTime="670.829" offset="2683298">The second count, the plaintiff is -- now, Mr. Derrick, the plaintiff, Derrick who alleges, readopts all the allegations of the first count and he alleges that he has -- is now operating and has for many years operate the drug store at Whitten, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.639" offset="2766472">And that he obtained a lot sublicense from the other plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.085" offset="2788310">And as soon as he obtain that sublicense, he wrote a letter to the Auditor of Public Accounts, defendant auditor who is the administrative in charged of the enforcement of the Act, and he told the auditor in his letter, this is submitted and the letter is an exhibit of the record, “That I have got this sublicense to sell these money orders in my drug store, and I understand that this statute would prohibit that, and I think that statute is unconstitutional and deprives me of the equal protection of the law under the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.835" offset="2951314">And as soon as I get my supplies, therefore, I'm going to proceed to sell these money orders in my drug store, just like I used to sell American Express money orders in my drug store.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.059" offset="3000216">We didn't have to have a licence because statute didn't apply to me then.”</text>
            <text syncTime="755.379" offset="3021427">And the evidence is clear, I know I think it's submitted here that he did proceed to sell them.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.467" offset="3049848">A number of the money orders that he actually sold are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.625" offset="3074403">Now, those are the material allegations of the complaint that are either admitted or supported by findings of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.155" offset="3140545">Now, in the Court's opinion, the Court started by saying, after stating who the parties were and that the defendants filed answers and the evidence was aduced for their respective parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.240" offset="3208882">An amicus curiae makes the contention which has been adapted by the defendants, and incidentally, was adapted by the Court, that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide the question of constitutionality raised by plaintiffs because that question has never been presented to the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.310" offset="3313162">And hence, the federal courts are without jurisdiction to determine it in the first instance, citing Spector Motor Company versus McLaughlin 323 U.S., and Federation of Labor versus McAdory 325 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.012" offset="3384007">Neither of which was a three-judge court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.615" offset="3406367">The Spector Motor case was asserted in the District Court of Connecticut, which asked for a declaratory judgment in accordance with the Connecticut law, and also, purported to raise a federal question as to the validity of that Connecticut statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.066" offset="3492258">The District Court in that case found that the – there was no federal question involved because the statute didn't apply to the plaintiffs at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.379" offset="3537502">And on appeal, the Court of Appeal said, “Well, yes, it does apply to the -- to the plaintiff, but the statute is valid.”</text>
            <text syncTime="892.132" offset="3568431">And the case came here and this Court said, “Well, here is the District Court, may had interpreted one way and the Court of Appeals determines another way and we can't tell it's very big and we don't know what it is if it's -- if it's so vague and if it doesn't apply to the plaintiff at all, then there is no federal question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="908.690" offset="3634678">They sent it back and they said, “The District Court of course had jurisdiction,” but they should hold it until it find out what the law means in the state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="933.732" offset="3734883">It has been held valid in Illinois that some question as to the character of the business that the plaintiffs were doing in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.220" offset="3784829">The Illinois Court has flatly said that this Act is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.931" offset="3799667">It doesn't violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.472" offset="3809802">They cited in a case in which two of the plaintiffs were partnership who are engaged only in the check cashing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.202" offset="3840731">The third plaintiff was engaged in the check cashing business, but he was also engaged in selling checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.735" offset="3870929">There is a customer coming by, check to pay the light bill and he write his check and send it to the light company.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.575" offset="3894230">He said, “That's not selling money orders, but if it is selling money orders, then this act is discriminatory against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.318" offset="3929234">Let's see, American Express Company do things that I can't do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="987.183" offset="3948669">The Supreme Court of Illinois said, “Well, that's – that's selling money orders all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.201" offset="3960790">It didn't matter the form of it, whether it's a check or whatever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.286" offset="3973120">It's an order on somebody to pay, and it's a money order all right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="997.980" offset="3991824">But the court said, “This act is valid because there's a reasonable basis for this classification, because this American Express Company is a nationally big organization and not a community currency exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.603" offset="4054309">And therefore, the act is perfectly valid.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.685" offset="4070713">Now, I'll come to that again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.878" offset="4075416">I don't want to evade that question, Your Honor, but I'll come back to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.823" offset="4095269">Now, the District Court said, after describing these activities with the American Express, the plaintiff and after reciting the statute, pointing out that in effect, that the plaintiff is within the definition of a community currency exchange, whereas American Express is excluded from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.289" offset="4181055">It does appears that plaintiff's intend to engage in only one phase of the activities in which a community currency exchange may engage if licensed under the Act in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.529" offset="4226090">That is, the business of selling or issuing money orders under their name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.072" offset="4244271">It also appears that American Express Company, which is exempt from the operation of this Act, is engaging in the same activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.566" offset="4282201">It further appears that plaintiffs intend to and American Express Company does engaged in his business through agents operating retail stores of the same types.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.305" offset="4333192">Now, the Court proceeded then to say this, at page 506 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.745" offset="4374883">The plaintiffs argued that, “It is the function and duty of this Court to determine whether or not the Act in question violates the Fourteenth Amendment as applied to these plaintiffs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.583" offset="4430263">On the other hand, the amicus curiae and the defendants argued that it is not the function and duty of this Court to determine that question, unless and until plaintiffs secure an answer to that question from the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.490" offset="4501943">And the Court then says, “It would seem that a plausible argument could be made on behalf of the plaintiffs to the Illinois Supreme Court predicated upon the fact that the identical similarity of the business conducted by American Express Company, which is exempt from regulation under the Act, and then in which plaintiffs intend to engage and which on its phase, the Act says, “It must be regulated from the State,” is an arbitrary discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.061" offset="4612180">If this argument were made to and accepted as valid by the Illinois Supreme Court, it might well grant the plaintiffs the very relief which they're seeking in this Court, and hence, a suit of this character would be unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.245" offset="4680934">In other words, if the plaintiffs went to the Supreme Court of Illinois and they got a decision there that this Act is valid and doesn't violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of United States, I assume from the Court's opinion they could then come into the three-judge District Court and have a review of the Supreme Court of Illinois, but that is the function of this Court, not a three-judge courts which as I understand it are given by Congress jurisdiction in this very kind of suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.928" offset="4843624">And I know of no case and the dissenting judge, Judge Hoffman said he was aware of no decision in which the Supreme Court of the United States has held that a Federal District Court must or even should refuse to entertain a suit under the circumstances present here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1347.794" offset="5391151">This – this exemption is set forth in a definition of the word community currency exchange, and that expression, community currency exchange so defined, occurs I think at 62 times in 20 different sections of this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.398" offset="5705561">And they say that unless, until that's decided, they don't know where they are and they say, “Hence, we can not decide the constitutional question presented in the absence of such authoritative determination by the Illinois Supreme Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.937" offset="5755716">Then, they said on the next page, “The Illinois Supreme Court might find that to deny the plaintiffs of that right would be to deprive them of the same protection which American Express Company enjoys under the law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.664" offset="5806602">It well may be that the Illinois Supreme Court would hold the exception of American Express Company unconstitutional as applied to persons in the position of these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.509" offset="5858011">Now, I think it a fair conclusion from the opinion and from statements the Court made at the conclusion of the trial that this Court thought the plaintiffs were entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.343" offset="5917362">They favored the plaintiffs on the merits, but they thought that is the majority thoughts that they didn't have a jurisdiction to give the relief which should be given because the Court said this, "A three-judge, court in a case involving a similar situation arising under the Currency Exchange Act of the State of Wisconsin, held that the exception of American Express Company rendered the statute discriminatory and unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff in that case, Currency Services verus Matthews, U.F.

            <text syncTime="1528.022" offset="6112026">In other words, I take it what the Court was intending to say that the Court didn't pass on the question of jurisdiction, which I had thought, in the very rendering of the decision and necessarily passed on their jurisdiction, but that is the only distinction, otherwise, this Court is disposed to follow that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.728" offset="7050867">I think it comes awfully close.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.667" offset="7058599">I think -- and the language of the Court as Judge Hoffman said in his dissent, the plaintiffs supported for the decision of another three-judge court in Currency Services versus Matthews, have raised a substantial federal constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.199" offset="7116696">The application of the challenged statute to the plaintiffs is unquestioned, and the Supreme Court of Illinois has already upheld the exemption of American Express Company without suggesting that its decision in any way rested on the nature of the activities of the plaintiffs in the decided case, McDougall versus Leuder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.812" offset="7191197">Then he says, “The balance between the State and federal relations is not so delicate that it would be upset by this Court's consideration of the merits of the plaintiffs' claim that the Illinois Currency Exchange Act has deprived them of the equal protection of the laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.117" offset="7248457">Now, I said that their conclusion from the opinion and from the Court's statements, the conclusion of the trial, I think was just -- which is that the Court thought the plaintiff should have relief, the plaintiff should have relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.302" offset="7305195">At page 97 of the record, Judge Schnackenberg said this, “I have a question I'd like to ask Mr. Wines and his associates from the States Attorney's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.202" offset="7352738">It is a little bit out of order in the way of taking things up seriatim chronologically.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.760" offset="7418984">Here is a question I'd like you to listen to very carefully if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.381" offset="7433509">Suppose the state legislature enacts a statute, providing for a state inspection of all weighing scales used in retail food shops to be evidenced by adhesive stamp, affixed by the inspector of this scale and providing that the owner should pay a fee for inspection and keep the stamp affixed for public exhibition and use no unstamped scale in his shop, and also providing penalties for violating a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.814" offset="7547193">And further providing that the statute should not apply to the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company shops and the scales they're in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.739" offset="7582929">If an owner of four or five retail food shops challenges the constitutionality of the statute as violative of the Federal Constitution's due process and equal protection of the law provisions, should the Court sustain that challenge?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.981" offset="7635905">Well, Mr. Wines answered that at page 99, “Now, to come back specifically to the hypothetical case put by Your Honor, Judge Schnackenberg, I would say that if there were only one grocery's chain of such worldwide establishment that exempting that chain might very well be constitutional.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.996" offset="7715944">Then he says, “I don't think that that is the situation in the grocery store business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.167" offset="7732663">So, just to answer your question, yes or no, I would say that the question that, Your Honor puts, the Act would be unconstitutional but that it is distinguishable.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2018.757" offset="8074971">If on the other hand, it is fair to presume that the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company is only human and they do make mistakes in their machines, frequently, they are too busy to have their machines corrected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.629" offset="10970488">In that, a said statute imposes licensed fees and conditions upon the sale of Bondified Systems money orders in separate business establishments and to exempt such sales of American Express Company money orders from all such requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.781" offset="11483115">And the form of the money order appears at page 224 of the record and it shows on its phase that these money orders are issued under a license that Bondified money order service operated under license granted to Bondified Systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.616" offset="11566393">Following the word “Bondified” is an asterisk.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.994" offset="11635879">And that's all the evidence there is in this record that indicates that there's anybody that -- that anybody has made any representations, and under the decisions we've cited in our reply brief, a license, the definition of a license is not limited to a license from the State and these were licensed and these people were bonded, and we say that there was no misrepresentation there in any way and the court below -- that did not take that seriously and refused to make the final fact upon it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4102.466" offset="16409809">When in a western outfit that has registered or in some way or other, they registered the name Bondified as a trademark on a form of check, and they have made a written agreement which is called a license to the plaintiffs, permitting them to use that name but that's a violation of the federal law, because as we explained very clearly in our brief, this Court has held that for the proprietor or trademark to permit another person to use it without guaranteeing the product, if it is a product or the financial responsibility, if it is a business is contrary to the public policy of the United States in trademark, copyright and postal money orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="4218.078" offset="16872281">If Mr. Jones had been making Manhattan medicine and sold the business, sold the assets, he wouldn't personally have had to guarantee their continued integrity, but he merely licensed the use of the name without in anyway transferring the business, assuming responsibility for the product either by way of supervising its manufacture and damnifying people for its defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.476" offset="16985861">He attempted to sell goodwill without selling the business and you can't do it as a matter of federal public policy, and there just isn't any question about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5128.899" offset="20515527">The -- we're talking about little money orders here that averaged $5 or $10, if people pay their light bills already, and the maximum is a $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.315" offset="20553247">The average of all the money orders in American Express sales is $10 according to the -- their chief officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.298" offset="20585117">And this Bonafide System sales money orders in various different states as the record shows and Illinois is the only one now that has this prohibition and regulates the business of money order sales and it exempts the American Express Company, and all the other states, they use the same money order which says that they're licensed here from these checks incorporated and they are bonded and they are licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.052" offset="20696189">And I was about to read the evidence on that, but I'm not going to go into that because we have said in our reply brief that this Court is asked to weigh evidence and make findings which the District Court refused to make and fail to make and made in contrary to have in findings that it did make.</text>
            <text syncTime="5192.202" offset="20768705">And that this Court has asked to draw inferences which the District Court refused to draw on this question of -- of coming in with clean hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.268" offset="20805068">Now, I want to call the Court's attention to -- of the decision in the Toomer case which was the fishery case where the shippers were of Georgia for complaining to cross South Carolina, wouldn't let them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.042" offset="20868075">Well, they imposed a very large license fees on their shrimping in the waters of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.817" offset="20895242">And they challenged that statute and this Court said that statute deprived them of the equal protection of the laws, and the -- the claim was made to that case by the Attorney General of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.970" offset="20947801">It's North Carolina or South Carolina that these plaintiffs, these shrimpers are coming in here, saying that their shrimping business was being discriminated against that were convicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.084" offset="21004330">They had repeatedly been convicted of shrimping contrary to the -- to the law and they -- they have served sentences for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.661" offset="21034632">And this Court said this, “Some of the individual appellants have previously been convicted of shrimping out of season and into waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.091" offset="21068278">The District Court held that this previous misconduct, not have any relation to the constitutionality of the challenged statutes did not call for application of the clean hands maxim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.952" offset="21111745">We agree.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.769" offset="21123030">Now, that's all what I want to say on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.189" offset="21136718">I want to say so far as the -- the exercise of federal equity jurisdiction is concerned, of course, this Court has always held that the Court will not come in just to -- to enjoin the -- the enforcement of the federal statute, but the exception is, if there is danger, immediate danger of irreparable injury, they will do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.516" offset="21237969">That's what they did in this Toomer versus Witsell case which is cited in our brief and we cited number of other cases at pages 11 and 12 of the brief for the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.660" offset="21278616">Here are men engaged, the citizens of Illinois engaged in a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.430" offset="21301708">During the year before this trial, they showed that they've sold a $1,400,000 worth of these money orders in Northern Indiana under the same licensure operating under in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.872" offset="21343399">Sure, they only got one agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.532" offset="21350087">They had to have a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.596" offset="21354371">They had to -- have a justiciable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.382" offset="21361476">They couldn't get in as a corporation because there was an arrangement made between the Secretary of State Office and this Audito, this is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.652" offset="21386553">So, they've -- they couldn't stop it from acting as individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.002" offset="21404003">They couldn't give -- wouldn't give them corporate license in Illinois so they couldn't get in, couldn't have any standard, but they operated as individuals and they did the best they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.090" offset="21440261">And we submit, Your Honor that the -- the jurisdiction is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.597" offset="21466384">These people have been deprived and everyday they're prevented from operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.685" offset="21482684">They're losing money, and now, it said they have to go to the state court or the State Supreme Court and again come up here, in the meantime that the laws is irremedial because you never could get it back from the State or anyone else, and it does come within the exception and is supported by the cases, we contend that is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.207" offset="21564813">Thank you very much.</text>
