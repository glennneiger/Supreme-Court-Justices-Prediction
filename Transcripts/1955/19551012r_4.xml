            <label>Mr. Edward J. Behrens</label>
            <text syncTime="9.176" offset="36676">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.013" offset="47961">When we adjourned yesterday, I had practically completed the presentation of my views concerning the possible effect upon Section 905, the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act, upon those they were not employees or claiming by subrogation through employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.369" offset="133433">I have referred to the two lines of obligation which I thought were in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.109" offset="156421">Those two separate lines of obligations which have been found by every state court, dealing with every state compensation statute which counsel confined in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.792" offset="215144">When the question of the constitutionality of the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act was before this Court, this Court adjudged it constitutional referring to the fact that as between stevedore and longshoremen, between employer and an employee, there was indeed quid pro quo, each was giving up something, each was getting something.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.504" offset="317962">Under the old law, without a workmen's compensation law in effect, a longshoreman would sue his stevedore employer in negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.555" offset="358191">The amount he could recover, if he could prove negligence was without limit but he had to prove negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.134" offset="388493">On the other hand, the employer had certain defenses with negligence of a fellow servant, assumption of risk and his other common law defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.896" offset="439484">So the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act as a compensation act stripped those defenses from the employer but in turn put a ceiling upon his obligation to his employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.649" offset="490580">He said how much in compensation he would have to pay for?</text>
            <text syncTime="127.086" offset="508343">Now, on the employee's side, he gave up something, an unlimited recovery but in turn, he -- he received something and namely, a right to receive compensation without regard to fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.564" offset="566230">So that negligence was removed from the field of employer-employee relationships and that was the quid pro quo, the something for something upon which the constitutionality of this Act was originally adjudged.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.658" offset="630596">It is obviously a question of fairness as to whether those not in the employer-employee relationship should be brought within the compass of this Act if they get nothing in return for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.005" offset="699977">Professor Larson has expressed it in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.625" offset="722442">Now, he's dealing not only with this Compensation Act but all state compensation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.655" offset="750550">"The question here becomes very precise that the compensation acts in conferring immunity on the employer from common lawsuits mean to do so only at the expense of the injured employee or also at the expense of outsiders, that's the problem we have here."</text>
            <text syncTime="206.689" offset="826723">One question is that the injured -- one answer is that the injured employee cut for it quid pro quo in receiving assured compensation payments as a substitute for tort recoveries while the third party has received absolutely nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.585" offset="902269">The third party here being the shipowner and hence, should not be impliedly held to have given up rights which he had before.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.718" offset="942811">It is unfair to pull the third party within the principle of mutual sacrifice when his part is to be all sacrifice and no corresponding gain.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="247.680" stopTime="298.530">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="247.680" offset="990668">Mr. Behrens, there's an intimation here that to sustain your position would change the relationship between the employer and the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.007" offset="1039987">In that, the employer would have charge of the litigation if he should go to a - to an order of the Commission before he made any payments and that -- that if he could not be liable otherwise and if he could control the litigation, that perhaps he wouldn't be as -- as free to make these voluntary payments as he would under the other construction of the -- the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.991" offset="1183869">What -- what have you to say to that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_j_behrens" startTime="298.530" stopTime="442.811">
            <label>Mr. Edward J. Behrens</label>
            <text syncTime="298.530" offset="1194109">Well, I think there are several facets to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.814" offset="1207171">The first one is this, that the law requires the employer to make compensation payments promptly and without any folderol unless the employer honestly controverts his obligation to pay compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.343" offset="1301316">The law requires him to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.679" offset="1310616">The Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act said that if you don't controvert your obligation to pay on the ground that the employee was not injured in the course of his employment, they must pay promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.173" offset="1356591">That's the first thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.724" offset="1362860">So that in effect, the argument is, is that we will violate the law which makes us pay promptly in order to accomplish another result.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.630" offset="1406433">In other words, there -- the argument is that they will force an injured longshoreman to an award before they will make their compensation payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.742" offset="1458887">Now, once the award is made, the employer will have control of the third-party suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.684" offset="1482710">But the answer is, they can't compel an employee to take an award either.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.867" offset="1503399">Now, most of these third-party cases, all of them to my knowledge are all started by the longshoremen and there is no award.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.296" offset="1533179">I don't know of a case in the last 12 years where there has been an award because once there is, there is this assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.942" offset="1567765">Let us assume, Mr. Chief Justice, that for the purpose of discussion in this case, Ryan had said to Mr. Palazzolo, "True it is, you were injured in the course of your employment, true it is, it's an industrial accident but we're not going to pay you a dime in compensation, you'll have to go to an award."</text>
            <text syncTime="411.426" offset="1645610">Now then, he has the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.193" offset="1656686">He can go to the Compensation Commission and demand a hearing and ask these people why -- why don't you pay this man or he can start his lawsuit against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.489" offset="1697855">The choice is in the hands of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.803" offset="1711125">They purport to have the choice by violating the law but actually they don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.188" offset="1732650">In other words, they can force the employee to do something by holding up his compensation but it's the employee to make the decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.811" offset="1771207">Well, is there any penalty against the employer if he does go to an award?</text>

            <text syncTime="824.037" offset="3296131">In short, in most cases as I understand it, the attorney for the injured man would agree with the compensation carrier that out of the recovery he will see to it that they are protected, that he will see they get back everything they paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.874" offset="3371468">But in this case for reasons unknown to me, the attorney and the injured man would not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.714" offset="3402815">And that's why the compensation carrier actually came in and intervened in this case and was a party to the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.264" offset="5305051">Mr. Schwartz says they haven't, I have no reason to suspect that the contrary is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.341" offset="5325322">I will accept it for the purpose of this case if they did have 1B coverage and that's what -- where we come down to the dollar aspects of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.785" offset="5363043">Their insurance company, represented here by Mr. Schwartz, paid out $13,000 roughly under that part of the policy which deals with compensation to Palazzolo, under the judgment they got that back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.449" offset="5433783">So now as a compensation carrier they're very happy, they have been made whole and though we had an industrial accident, they have not -- to pay anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.929" offset="5471713">But now, under the other coverage of the policy, here comes the shipowner and said, “You breached your obligation to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.594" offset="5506299">All right you took care of Palazoolo but you breached your contract with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.600" offset="5522390">Now, under your general public liability part of the policy, you pay out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.959" offset="5547781">And that's the way that the twofold problem is -- is created in dollars so that here we have no compensation phases at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.564" offset="5602220">Those are all behind us and now we are down to a point of 1B coverage in behalf of the stevedore, should that insurance company pay over to the ship for breach of the contract, I mean that's about the dollar size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.412" offset="5677558">Now, as far as 905 is concerned and its possible effect on the case of this type, not employer-employee but strangers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.218" offset="5720816">That argument in our Second Circuit has been worn out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.430" offset="5737639">Our Second Circuit doesn't even write on that subject anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.553" offset="5758119">It was argued here as usual but the Court has written so often and so fully and I think so clearly on this question of the utter inapplicability of 905 that every state court in dealing with state compensation with having reached the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.421" offset="5833665">Our Court of Appeals doesn't even write on it anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.467" offset="5845786">Well, it was argued here, it was briefed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.817" offset="5855190">Quite for a long time now, they thought that the matter had been set at rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.855" offset="5879327">Now, we have another problem here concerning which I should speak very, very briefly and that is contribution and indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.464" offset="5925825">Says the petitioner, if indemnity is only a big form of contribution and this Court has said in maritime matters you can't have any contribution, referring to the Halcyon case, then of course indemnity should die too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.989" offset="6007954">What's wrong?</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.440" offset="6009731">Well, that's the major premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.138" offset="6024464">We might say from a grammatical standpoint or an oratorical standpoint that you can express it from those words but they're too separate and distinct subjects, they arise from different sources and they result in entirely different results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.559" offset="6090188">Contribution means that several people owing a common annuity to the injured man have to pay their aliquot share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.499" offset="6141910">Indemnity simply means the making whole of someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.648" offset="6158524">Now, contribution, generally speaking, depends upon a legislative will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.096" offset="6184333">Contribution is not ordinarily the result of the exercise of the judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.238" offset="6212859">This Court pointed it out very clearly in Halcyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.009" offset="6228010">There's no such thing as contribution as an old common law principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.786" offset="6255073">We find statutes in modern days in the various states now giving contribution on joint tortfeasors but it's the legislature that speaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.781" offset="6299063">As this Court said, common law courts are very reluctant to create that new right of contribution and said if you want contribution, this aliquot share business, go to the legislature before you get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.071" offset="6364264">But indemnity has never depended upon the legislative will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.101" offset="6380356">That's been a part of our common law from the beginning, we've always has that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.045" offset="6400104">We're not here asking the Court to come up with some new right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.705" offset="6414733">We're asking the Court to go along with the right that's always existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.470" offset="6433855">Sixty years ago, 1895, in Washington Gas Light, this Court recognized that the common law right of indemnity, not contribution, indemnity was even then an old doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.401" offset="6489548">That it had been applied in all the manner of cases in order to work out a proper solution of a problem as between two persons, each of whom may have been wrong to a degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.223" offset="6548793">Contribution of course can only arise from a tort, two or more people owing the plaintiff a duty that injured him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.501" offset="6577946">On the other hand, indemnity may arise from a contract, as the Court of Appeals said in this case or it can arise from tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.994" offset="6611905">The courts have said that if in effect one of the parties can be held partially at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.427" offset="6641685">In a negative way, they failed to discover such things as we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.020" offset="6664046">The primary actor can be made to indemnify, isn't anything new in the law on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.541" offset="6690064">It's somewhat analogous to the collision cases in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.318" offset="6705215">That if you find one vessel with enormous fault and you find a little bit of fault over here on the other side, you're not going to go half damage, you're going to throw out a little fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.265" offset="6748996">And in a sense, the old law of indemnity which is applied both on the land and the sea has that sort of a thought behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.709" offset="6786821">Now, as questions were being put yesterday and my learned adversary was answering them, it came to my mind, something I haven't put in the briefs or something that I'd refer to the citation, the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.845" offset="6859337">But when Mr. Justice Cardozo sat on our Court of Appeals in New York, he wrote an opinion in a case that sort have become all casebook case called Palsgraf against The Long Island Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.755" offset="6926942">And then Mr. Justice Cardozo wrote in effect, there is no such thing as negligence in the air so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.947" offset="6967693">One must always make the inquiry to whom is the obligation hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.231" offset="6996846">There isn't any such thing as an act of being simply negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.589" offset="7014296">The question is whose acts was (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.102" offset="7028402">Now, when we apply that theory, that fundamental proposition to this case, the error that persisted in the trial and in the resolution of the problem between shipowner and stevedore, I think this manifest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.166" offset="7232575">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.262" offset="7232470">Judge Inch called shipowner and stevedore joint tortfeasors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.663" offset="7232366">What duty in negligence did Ryan owe Palazzolo and the answer is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.242" offset="7232261">They couldn't have been negligent as to Palazzolo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.765" offset="7232157">Their relationship to Palazzolo has been removed from the realm of negligence, where the very legislation we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.557" offset="7232052">You can't say Ryan is negligent as to Palazollo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.065" offset="7236232">Because they don't owe him any duty of care, the statute -- that's all they have to do is pay him compensation so that when you can't be a tortfeasor it becomes manifest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.973" offset="7291820">I think it becomes manifest that there was that fundamental error in the case if -- because that was the basis of the denial of our right to indemnity that we were joint tortfeasors of the scope of appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.306" offset="7357127">I think it is important because the judge did not find properly as a matter of fact, that they were joint -- we were joint tortfeasor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.220" offset="9512856">Why if an employer is exposed to being impleaded by the third party who has been sued by his injured longshoreman, why that employer or the compensation carrier, assuming that he's covered by a compensation carrier, cannot controvert by filing a notice of controversy, the claim of the longshoreman for compensation?</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.651" offset="9614524">Now, the only penalty that the statute prescribes is if the controversion was not a good one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.090" offset="9644304">And that they controverted it without any real ground that there is a 10% penalty that is affixed to the award, so that if the man were entitled to $2000 as compensation, the compensation carrier would then be liable for $2200.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.764" offset="9710968">And that is the only penalty that the statute prescribed in -- in the event that there is a controverted claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.651" offset="9826534">If a man is injured, in the State of New York, he has three years to bring an action in negligence as against a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.052" offset="9860180">Under a recent decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, if he predicates his right upon a breach of warranty of seaworthiness as against the shipowner, they say he has six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.017" offset="9908036">Now, during that interim of three years within which he can bring his lawsuit or within six years, depending upon the theory, that man would be entitled to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.185" offset="9956728">And the compensation carriers today, all of them that I know of have voluntarily paid this man compensation during either those three years or during the six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.385" offset="10005525">But the moment that he files his election to sue a third party, the statue has been construed to mean that all compensation payments may then be suspended by the compensation carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.128" offset="10056411">So now, let's see what they do in mechanics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.253" offset="10068950">A longshoreman, having three years to bring his action as against the third party, takes compensation voluntarily given to him by the compensation carrier prior to, just shortly before that three years expires, he then brings his action against the third party.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.048" offset="10432157">Ryan in this case was fortunate enough to have $25,000 coverage but in dollars and cents to Ryan it means that if this recovery over is against them, which now is approximately $80 odd thousand with interest and -- and cost is to stand Ryan's compensation carrier because they have a 1B coverage on their workmen's compensation policy, we'll pay $25,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.910" offset="10531631">Ryan, out of their own pocket, will have to pay some $50 or $60 odd thousand to the insurer of the steamship company because there the construction of the statute has gone against him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3139.780" offset="12559047">And there, the Court of Appeals for Maryland in dealing with this very statute and in dismissing and affirming the dismissal of the third-party complaint said this, in the absence of waiver, now obviously that must mean by contract or something by which the employer divest himself of the immunity of the statute which we contend for, the employer's conformance with the statute by providing compensation in all cases regardless of fault prevents recovery against him on the ground of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.306" offset="12689136">The statute declares his liability for compensation to be exclusive if it should be construed to preserve his liability for the payment of a sum measured in whole or in part by the damages sustained by the employee merely because the negligence of a third party concurred or is claimed to have concurred with his own in producing the injury, his liability for compensation would not be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.132" offset="12796447">It is probable that his liability would in most cases exceed the limits setup in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.210" offset="12820793">We think it is immaterial whether his liability to a joint tortfeasor stems from a statutory right that contribution opens general principles of the admiralty law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.856" offset="12859350">In either event, it is essentially a liability to pay or share in the payment of damages for the injury to his employee of which the statute relieves him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3755.250" offset="15020931">Now, if you can say that where a shipowner who was obligated as the cargo mate said that it was the duty of the ship to furnish the wedges and chocks, if you can say that they, having furnished defective or insufficient appliances, are merely guilty of passive negligence and can get it all over from us then I say that's profitable negligence in their favor because whatever they've been held liable for, they recoup from us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.272" offset="15125002">Well, we had assumed that being under the control and supervision of the cargo mate, having done everything satisfactory as far as he was concerned with overall complete authority in him to stop the work anytime he was dissatisfied, which he was not dissatisfied with that he is negligent.</text>

          <turn speaker="leavenworth_colby" startTime="3946.187" stopTime="4414.095">
            <label>Mr. Leavenworth Colby</label>
            <text syncTime="3946.187" offset="15784647">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.036" offset="15792065">As amicus curiae for this case, the Government is interested in spite a different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.417" offset="15825607">As you have heard here today, the shape of this case is determined by the peculiar organization of Waterman Steamship Company and its two subsidiaries, Ryan Stevedoring and Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company on the one hand and the circumstance that in the compensation insurance policy of Ryan Stevedoring Company, there is in addition to the compensation coverage a clause 1B of the standard New York form policy which to the extent of $25,000 will indemnify Ryan Stevedoring Company against secondary losses arising out of injury to their employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.639" offset="16046498">The United States in its capacity of stevedore does not insure its risks and in its capacity of shipowner does not insure very many of its risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.306" offset="16113162">Now, at the time that the litigation now pending in the District Courts arose, the Government was primarily a shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.727" offset="16158824">Indeed, in Mr. Schwartz's petition for rehearing, Your Honors may have noticed that the vast majority, I think about 65% of the cases involving this problem that are listed as pending, are cases in which the United States were shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.598" offset="16230296">At the present time however, we are operating only an average of 20 vessels at the end of each month.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.088" offset="16260284">That's the way they make up the statistics form.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.702" offset="16270733">So that we are not so important as a shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.341" offset="16285362">We continue to be very important as a stevedore and as a ship repairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.387" offset="16317544">I have had some difficulty getting statistics in respect of the Government's interest as stevedore and ship repairman because except for the Panama Canal, the Panama Canal Company, they do not make very good statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.296" offset="16385149">But I would like to call your attention to the fact that during the fiscal years, 1955 and the preceding year 1954, the Panama Canal Company alone stevedored 3118 vessels in 1955 and stevedored 2882 vessels in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.176" offset="16496640">It was a ship repair contractor in respect of 1254 vessels in 1955 and 1169 vessels in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.274" offset="16549094">And so, the Government feels that by a reason of its large interest, both as a Stevedore contractor and as a ship repair contractor and after all the rights are similar and as a shipowner we are entitled to point out that our view of this -- of the problems here is somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.723" offset="16642821">As Mr. Behrens has pointed out, he feels and I think correctly that the Court of Appeals found in his favor on two theories, not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.736" offset="16690887">One of the theories was the theory of indemnity for major and minor fault under the law of something very similar to joint tortfeasorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.178" offset="16752640">And he has explained to you in his closing argument here why he thought that the Court of Appeals was correct in upholding him on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.173" offset="16792660">Now, this is important in this particular case because such a liability is clearly within clause 1B of the standard form Compensation Act and he's indemnified for with respect to Masters Ryan, the subsidiary of Pan-Atlantic -- the subsidiary of Waterman to be extended $25,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.214" offset="16880849">So that's $25,000 that Waterman subsidiary don't have to pickup.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.771" offset="16899030">Now, on the other theory which the Court of Appeals equally sustained the case on that is to say breach of the contract for professional employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.008" offset="16943961">It is highly doubtful in my mind that clause 1B applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.435" offset="16961724">And of course if it doesn't apply, why that's $25,000 more that Ryan Stevedoring has got to pay for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.540" offset="16990145">So the necessity for dealing with this as a joint tortfeasorship problem is barely obvious as between the advocates who've addressed the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.491" offset="17033927">Now, as I say the Government doesn't insure itself and its problems are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.087" offset="17052317">And we believe that the correct approach to the problem is the old familiar one that when you hire the garageman to repair the car, you don't undertake to hire someone else or yourself to test the car to see whether he performed his contract and that's what this is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.794" offset="17135073">Now, there are of course considerations on both sides and the Government is interested on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.766" offset="17162971">But basically, what Mr. Schwartz is trying to tell us here today is that the view previously taken by the courts in respect of professional employment shall be changed in order to conform that abuse that the Court have taken with respect to joint tortfeasorship and with this the Government disagrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.912" offset="17263595">In work, the question that we think has to be resolved here is whether it is compatible with public policy to read Section 5 of the Compensation Act as exonerating an expert contractor from liability to his customer for breach of his contract caused by his own negligence in badly performing the work he contracted to do with professional skill and care.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.354" offset="17393371">Now, Mr. Schwartz says that when you hire a stevedore to stevedore a vessel properly and he doesn't do it, you may not recover the damages that you suffered by reason of his breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.972" offset="17467873">And he said that is due to Section 5 of the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.310" offset="17489189">Now, I find it extremely unlikely that this is the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.216" offset="17512803">Mr. Schwartz has cited you the cases that hold that indemnity being joint tortfeasorship cases is to go by the same rule as contribution and that there isn't any.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.106" offset="17564421">That maybe correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.800" offset="17571109">We are not interested but Mr. Schwartz has an obligato to his argument in which he contends that Section 5 has also exonerated an expert contractor from liability to his customer for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.759" offset="17650939">Now, much has been made to the question --</text>

            <text syncTime="4426.959" offset="17707781">Now, if Your Honor will recall, when you hire the garageman, when you hire a furnish repairman, when you hire an elevator repairman and it's just the same when you hire a ship repairer or a stevedore, 9 times out of 10 you don't sign with him a written contract which contains any clauses whatsoever, you call him up on the telephone and say I want it fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.679" offset="17822616">You take the car into the garage and you say fix it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.252" offset="17836931">And nobody signs anything and there are no clauses in there that say that he does promise to do the work skillfully and respond in damages if he does it badly or that he won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.028" offset="17888026">Now, most stevedoring at least where the Government is concerned is done on the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.066" offset="17912163">Some naval supply officer calls up a stevedoring company on the phone and says, "You stevedored for us before, will you take care of this?</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.672" offset="17954586">We don't have the personnel to see to it."</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.609" offset="17970364">Comes under all circumstances, they sometimes stevedore aboard regular battleships due to the fact that enough of the crew is going on leave and are not regarded as skillful in shore sided operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.817" offset="18019265">The Court is not a -- the pier is not a military pier, all sorts of variations like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.967" offset="18043820">It also goes on with respect to other vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.357" offset="18057404">Now, the Army has a habit of signing formal stevedoring contracts by the year at the port of New York and we had one such contract before this Court in the Porello case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.583" offset="18114247">But those are quite exceptional from the standpoint of number of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.641" offset="18138488">I suspect they're barely exceptional even from the standpoint of volume, dollars and cents wise, the payments made by the Government for stevedoring the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4544.962" offset="18179762">I also have the impression, not dignify it further, that by and large when we're acting as stevedore through the Panama Canal and through other facilities, we don't ordinarily sign when we're the stevedore contractor, formal contracts with anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.881" offset="18247471">Now, from time immemorial, it has been assumed that when a professional contractor, a lawyer, a garageman, an elevator repairman, a ship repairman, a stevedore holds himself out to do a good professional job and he doesn't do a good professional job and the client suffers damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.639" offset="18362514">The client can recover those damages that are consequent upon the expert's reach of his duty that he assumed to do the job right.</text>

            <text syncTime="4612.750" offset="18450913">One of the reasons, there's been so little litigation on this subject is that until Mr. Schwartz begun his contentions that the same rule applied to the garageman, didn't apply to the stevedore, there was very little of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.394" offset="18521548">But he won a case in Matthews and the American Casualty Company, at least the other way around, American Casualty Company and Matthews, and he has been endeavoring to extend the rule since with great success.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.862" offset="18583406">But we don't think he should extend to take in quite everything.</text>

            <text syncTime="4667.352" offset="18669401">If the accident was due to the defective part, I assume he would not and those holdings have been made with respect to ship repairmen and stevedores and this Court has denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.184" offset="18732722">The same things would be true, I think for the garageman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.824" offset="18743275">But now, the type of situation that we have in this case really, we will now adjudge it to the garageman, as I take my car into the garage to have the brakes fixed and I come in as I always do at 6 o'clock when they're trying to shut the door and I come to take my car away and they've got it aimed out so I can go out the door and I get in and I start the car and I press on the brake and I pushed the accelerator pedal a couple of times and everything seems all right but I don't make any test, I don't go into anything in detail although I have done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4722.097" offset="18888307">I start to drive the car out, the accelerator pedal jammed because of something that they did when they were fixing the brake.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.054" offset="18924147">And I could have --if I had continued my investigation there, as I owe the duty to outsiders to do, I could have known that it would jam but I didn't and I started out the accelerator pedal jammed, the car went forward, the car strikes another customer's car and in the other customer's car is riding the customer and a car jockey employed by the garage contractor who just did the job for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.992" offset="19059879">And I injured the other customer's car and I injured the other customer and I injured the car jockey employed by my garageman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.668" offset="19102616">And the customer sues me for his personal injuries and for the damage to his vehicle and the car jockey brings a third-party suit against me for his personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.739" offset="19142949">It may all recover because it's holding that I should have been more careful in testing the car and should have discovered this defectual performance by my garageman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.961" offset="19199791">So now, I turn and I tried to sue my garageman for the damage that he's caused me by doing my work badly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.312" offset="19237198">And of course this is in the District of Columbia where the Longshoremen's and the Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is the local Compensation Act and what this Court decides today will govern what is done in the case of the garageman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.579" offset="19286309">So I am met by the contention of the garageman, "Oh, you can't recover because the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, which is the Compensation Act to the District of Columbia, exonerates me from liability because it says that when I pay my employees, as the garageman, that's the extent of my liability."</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.663" offset="19394560">Now, I don't understand Mr. Schwartz's contention point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.802" offset="19411174">I don't know whether he says it exonerates the garageman from liability for damage to the other customer's car liability over.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.789" offset="19451089">My right of recovering my damages in the form of what I had to pay then which is sometimes called indemnity which is a very different thing from indemnity and contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.124" offset="19492467">I don't know whether Mr. Schwartz says, "I can't recover what I had to pay the customer for damage to his car."</text>

            <text syncTime="4886.659" offset="19546593">I am clear that Mr. Schwartz says, "I can't recover back the money I have to pay the car jockey because of the breach of contract by my garageman."</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.384" offset="19589433">Now, this has never been the law, I'm sure, up until the present time but that is what Mr. Schwartz is asking this Court to decide.</text>

            <text syncTime="4970.781" offset="19883050">-- we think that it could be explained in a way and you'll notice that when the case got to the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals was apparently aware of the coin having two sides, one, breach of a professional contract of employment with the liability to respond in damages therefore and the other, contribution and indemnity in a joint tortfeasorship sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.205" offset="19984718">Now, I read the opinion like Mr. Behrens as having held that the ship should have recovered on both theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.505" offset="20013976">Now, I'm sure that Waterman Steamship Company represented by Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Behrens in both in a sense, although they both represent underwriters too.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.666" offset="20058593">I'm sure that Waterman Steamship Company would prefer to have this case rested upon the ground of joint tortfeasorship type indemnity because then clearly the underwriter on Ryan Stevedoring's clause 1B coverage, we'll pay $25,000 and if it's rested on breach of the contract of professional employment, I'm not sure that they will.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.097" offset="20160366">I don't think that any of the decided cases on clause 1B have said that you pay for a liability rested on that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.679" offset="20206655">Now, they might so hold when they got around to decided it but the New York case which would govern the 1B coverage in this case of Cardinal Engineering Company, which you'll find somewhere in the Government's brief there, did not deal with a recovery on the theory of breach of a contractual duty owed to the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.828" offset="20299233">Now, that's what this is about and I'd like to comment on the facts of this situation that we're being asked to put the burden on the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.221" offset="20328803">Your Honors will notice on this record that there was a mate here, just one mate, the cargo mate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.213" offset="20356807">He is supposed to be in general supervision of the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.226" offset="20372898">Now, what does that mean from the standpoint of supervising the stevedores?</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.127" offset="20392438">There were five hatches and number three was a double hatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.535" offset="20410096">So in number three there were two stevedore gangs working and in each one of the other hatches, there was one stevedore gang working.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.712" offset="20442802">Now, that's six stevedore gangs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.347" offset="20453355">Each stevedore gang consists of 21 men, the record so show us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.252" offset="20472999">Now, these 21 men are divided as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.809" offset="20491180">There are three men who look after the winches.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.904" offset="20503615">There is a hatch boss.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.111" offset="20512392">In other words, six hatch bosses for the -- for the six gangs operating on the four single and one double hatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.290" offset="20549068">One hatch boss, one gangway man who does the signaling for the lifts, then there are eight men on the dock and eight men in the hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.120" offset="20580415">And the eight men in the hold are divided into four offshore men and four inshore men or four at the side of the ship towards the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.694" offset="20622733">Now, that is the personnel right on the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.420" offset="20641646">Now, I think the record shows, but I wouldn't prepare -- pretend to sufficiently accurate knowledge, I may have been mistaken but the usual practice is in addition the stevedore has a ship supervisor and ordinarily a pier supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.856" offset="20707370">So now, you have six foremen, six hatch bosses which are supervisory personnel for the stevedore contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.591" offset="20746344">You have at least a ship supervisor, who is supervisory personnel for the stevedore contractor, and you may have a pier supervisor besides who would be over all the ships that were loading at that pier at that time and would come down with chain of command to the ship supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.678" offset="20822622">Now, with all these supervisory personnel and all these group of men stevedoring the vessel and remember the contracting stevedore has been employed for his expertise in how to load a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5221.133" offset="20884480">He's employed to know something that a cargo mate is not supposed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.008" offset="20904020">The cargo mate is to be made on behalf of the shipowner absolutely responsible to see that the stevedore contractor does his work right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.528" offset="20954070">One little man who has to go in to five hatches then and be omnipresent and see what six gangs of 21 men each are supposed to do and he is supposed to be the man that's going to decide whether or not this expert, for whom the ship has paid, has done his work right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.043" offset="21040170">Now, we've got in our brief a lot of cases and I never thought it was controverted until today that when you hire an expert, you don't owe him any duty to inspect his work, to see that he does it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.324" offset="21097221">He owes the duty to you to do it right because you're paying him to do it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.437" offset="21117701">But Mr. Schwartz says that the ship was in control through it's cargo mate and it was the responsibility of the ship to see that this professional stevedore did right what it was paid to do and because they didn't do their work right, the ship is responsible and then he says, "And besides in any event, Section 5 -- Code Section 905, the Compensation Act says that they can't be responsible if they're good boys and pay their employees the compensation that Congress is providing."</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.443" offset="21269734">Now, I do not think that's the law and we've explained it very plain in our brief why we think it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5324.156" offset="21296588">Now, I would like to comment briefly about the general situation that develops in the course of these cases with respect to reading Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.341" offset="21405362">Now, as the Court has noticed, everybody says the legislative history was silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.873" offset="21447471">All this Court has really ever been able to find out about the Longshoremen's and Compensation -- Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act in any case is that Congress patterned it after the New York Compensation Act because as Mr. Behrens explained yesterday, they had been unsuccessful in having the local compensation acts applied in maritime cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5385.957" offset="21543811">Afterwards, Congress applied the same Longshoremen's Compensation Act to the District of Columbia as the local Compensation Act and applied it to the overseas defense basis as the Defense Basis Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5400.825" offset="21603265">Both the D.C.Compensation Act and the Defense Basis Act, in other words, the one section in the acts state the rights are governed by the Longshoremen's Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5469.327" offset="21877238">Now, that's this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.540" offset="21882149">That's true in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.013" offset="21888000">Now, what we're concerned with here is the question of whether Section 5 or whether the circumstances of these cases prevent the person who employs the garageman or the stevedore or whatever, recovering his damages in the form of what he had to pay a third party who was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="5496.868" offset="21987370">And as I say, I find no cases cited that hold that he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="5500.830" offset="22003252">I find cases cited by Mr. Schwartz very well that in respect of joint tortfeasorhip, indemnity goes by the same rule as contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.327" offset="22045257">There are a lot of cases the other way too and I wouldn't say that Mr. Behrens is not more than correct in saying that he thinks so as a better reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.666" offset="22078589">But now, that's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.879" offset="22083500">Now, looking at Section 5 and applying the -- the just and generous rule, we would reach the conclusion that the obligations arising out of a contract of professional employment of the professional contractor to respond in damages to his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.161" offset="22164584">We're not within the universe that Congress intended to take away liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.614" offset="22190393">Now, that's the -- that's the first consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.193" offset="22204709">Then there is the phenomena that as I say state and federal cases on this problem of professional responsibility have not gone that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5562.995" offset="22251938">Finally, we think that public policy requires, just like in the both-to-blame situation, Both-To-Blame Clause in the cargo case, the Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.693" offset="22310766">Public policy requires leaving the responsibility or the professional expert's negligence on the professional expert and not shifting it to the client or customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.462" offset="22373773">So that we think that in the absence of a legislative history that should compel a construction that Section 5 didn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5601.551" offset="22406165">Now additionally, if Your Honors will recall what we had before us in the Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company, both-to-blame case, they have the same problem that Mr. Schwartz talked about here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5614.685" offset="22458723">The question was that it was anomalous that the ship should be fully exonerated from paying for cargo damage if it was solely at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.340" offset="22501355">But when the other ship was at fault too, it should have to pay half the damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.688" offset="22522671">But Your Honors had no difficulty with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.958" offset="22531762">Now, that litigation through the years followed the same pattern as we have here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5639.685" offset="22558720">In the Delaware, back in volume 161 of the United States reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="5647.160" offset="22588604">The question had come up of whether since the ship, the other ship, a non-carrying ship with respect to the cargo in a both-to-blame situation would be able if -- would be able to pay the cargo owner the full value of his cargo that was lost and then collect over against the carrying ship, did Section 3 of the Harter Act, which was written with the same universality as Section 5 of the Compensation Act, exonerate the carrying vessel from liability to the non-carrying vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5685.624" offset="22742413">In other words, could they, like Mr. Schwartz wants to do with the stevedore here, put all of the burden on to the non-carrying vessel and treat the Section 3 of the Harter Act as a sword as well as the shield, just as my brother here wants to preach -- to treat Section 5 the Compensation Act, as a sword as well as the shield and the Court said, "Oh, no."</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.602" offset="22842305">And so, form the time of the Delaware on, it was necessary for the carrying ship, although it was free when it was solely at fault, to pay half the damage to the cargo in those cases where the other ship was also at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.748" offset="22918896">And then in Atlantic Mutual, last term, we got up to the problem of could the carrying ship by contract take the position that Mr. Schwartz wants to take here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.242" offset="22976888">He was asked this very question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5747.115" offset="22988382">Now, we held in the Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company that he couldn't, although it was not more symmetrical for the carrying ship not to pay anything when it was jointly at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="5761.733" offset="23046896">The same as it did when it was solely at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="5764.276" offset="23057032">Still the public policy of making the contractor liable for his own negligence dictated the contrary solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.539" offset="23090155">And we think that's the situation here today that the policy, the general public policy of making the contractor, the professional contractor to pose himself out, solely liable for his fault, shouldn't bring about the construction of Section 5 to exonerate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5790.724" offset="23162880">Thank you.</text>
