            <text syncTime="66.188" offset="264673">It involves the constitutionality of New York City Charter Section 903, that's the same statute that was considered by the Court in the Regan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.188" offset="324650">The Court did not pass on the constitutionality of the statute in that case or at least the problems that are here presented were not presented in the Regan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.361" offset="381388">The question before the Court is simply whether a State can pass a law forbidding its employees to invoke a constitutional right in a federal proceeding or whether it can pass a law providing for the discharge of public employees who invoke the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in a federal proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.037" offset="1300062">Well, if Your Honor please, on the -- on the questions that were raised on the motion to amend the remittitur, I think the -- the counsel for the city took the position that if these questions had been passed upon by the Court, there was now a necessity for the amendment of the remittitur.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.247" offset="1384908">And I believe the Court adopted that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.436" offset="1393685">I think it was perfectly correct, if I may say, and has nothing to do with the issue before the Court, I oppose the -- or I was -- I advise against the making of a motion to amend the remittitur because I thought that the record was quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.536" offset="1470067">If I may proceed with the argument or rather what the facts of this particular case, before September 1952, Professor Slochower had been a teacher or professor of literature and of German at Brooklyn College.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.190" offset="1544673">He had been teaching there for some 27 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.162" offset="1568601">In September of 1952, he was called before United States Senate Subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.947" offset="1595768">The Subcommittee was investigating the Internal Security Act and at the very outset, Senator Ferguson, who was the Chairman of the Committee, made it clear that he was not investigating the public educational system but only the internal security problems that affected the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.567" offset="1682181">There was some later qualification of that statement by another member of the Committee but I think that the opening statement of the Chairman stood as the purpose of the -- as the purpose of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.013" offset="1728052">Dr. Slochower came before the Senate Subcommittee and testified freely on the question of present membership in the Communist Party, even not that he was a member of the Communist Party at the time of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.425" offset="1801613">He stated, he had not been a member of the Communist Party for the years following 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.607" offset="1842364">He invoked his privilege against self-incrimination only with respect to questions relating to the years 1940 and 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.411" offset="1881548">He said he would answer any other question that the Committee asked and he did.</text>
