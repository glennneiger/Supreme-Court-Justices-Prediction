            <label>Mr. George Morris Fay</label>
            <text syncTime="35.093" offset="140330">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.241" offset="148898">This case is the companion case of United States versus Minker.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.377" offset="165407">The questions are similar to the questions presented in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.296" offset="189127">The facts in the instant case might be briefly examined before and claim into my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.080" offset="228310">The two petitioners here, Salvatore and Joseph Falcone, were brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.917" offset="247641">They were born in Italy and immigrated to this country in 1907 with their parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.851" offset="279301">They were naturalized in the courts of the State of New York in 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.611" offset="298423">They continued to live in this country thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.427" offset="309708">In 1952, the petitioner, Salvatore Falcone, was residing in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.334" offset="337293">He was away from the city and his residence at the time when an immigration officer visited there and left words that when he returned, he should report to the immigration office.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.802" offset="379193">He voluntarily went down upon his returning to the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.461" offset="397793">He submitted -- he was informed that a charge have been made against him that he was an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.246" offset="416914">He submitted his naturalization certificate and at that time, he answered all questions that were propounded to him by this hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.843" offset="451291">Seven months later, he received a letter from the immigration office, telling him to come in again and to bring with him his naturalization certificate on an official manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.212" offset="496744">He again appeared, tendered his certificates and answered all questions that were propounded to him at that time by the immigration officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.508" offset="533943">Simultaneously in Utica, New York, his brother, petitioner Joseph, had received an identical letter for his appearance at the Utica office on the same day that Salvatore was appearing in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.396" offset="585561">He also appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.597" offset="594338">He appeared with counsel and propounded to question to the examiner as to the purpose of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.796" offset="623177">He was refused any explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.279" offset="633104">And on the advice of counsel, he refused to make a statement as requested by the hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.953" offset="659749">Two months later in June of 1953, the petitioner Joseph Falcone was served with a subpoena in a nature of the subpoena duces tecum to bring with him his certificate of naturalization, his birth certificate, and his certificate of entry to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.810" offset="719203">He again appeared at the office of Immigration Service with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.194" offset="736758">Counsel, at that time, informed the hearing officer that they were appearing specially to question the validity of the subpoena with respect to its direction against a citizen of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.746" offset="802900">At the same time, counsel voluntarily submitted for examination, aside from the subpoena, the certificates of naturalization, original entry and birth certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.811" offset="863190">But after further questioning by the hearing officer and the insistence on counsel that the petitioner Joseph should not answer the questions, the hearing was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.861" offset="907389">At that stage, the counsel for petitioner, Joseph Falcone, asked if he could have the right to purchase a transcript of the stenographic notes that were taken at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.053" offset="952111">He was refused that right on the grounds that they were confidential records of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.556" offset="970188">It couldn't be furnished to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.444" offset="981682">Ten days later, his brother, petitioner Salvatore, received an identical subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.308" offset="1005192">The Court already knows how that subpoena is worded, in re Salvatore Falcone.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.365" offset="1029433">No explanation on the face of the subpoena as to the purpose or the nature of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.910" offset="1051585">He also appeared at the office with counsel and raised a special plea as to the jurisdiction of the immigration officer to subpoena him there for questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.079" offset="1092232">He too, tendered his naturalization certificate to prove that he was a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.119" offset="1124415">Thereafter, in September of 1953, the United States Attorney moved in District Court for an order to show cause why this subpoena should not be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.926" offset="1175615">There was a hearing before District Court Judge Foley in Utica, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.051" offset="1196199">The evidence was all presented and Judge Foley ruled at that time and his opinion appears at page 26 of the transcript of the record in number 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.761" offset="1271014">Judge Foley refused to enforce these subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.196" offset="1292748">And he predicated his refusal, "On the ground that the limitation of this administrative subpoena power in my judgment must be kept within the confines of the provisions as stated and restricted to such purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.029" offset="1336111">And there's not the slightest indication in the legislative background, nor the terms of the provisions that it may be used for the investigative purpose here sought against a naturalized citizen."</text>
            <text syncTime="343.903" offset="1375608">The language appearing on page 32 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.309" offset="1389192">Then going over to page 34, he concluded that if the subpoena here were allowed to stand, the judicial procedure for the -- revocation of naturalization certificates would be preempted by administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.582" offset="1446243">And the provisions for personal notice, 60-day time period to answer in Section 340 (a) of the Act would be empty words.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.635" offset="1494518">Thus, it's apparent that the facts in the instant case differ slightly from those in the Minker case.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.619" offset="1522416">Here, there was compliance by these two citizens with this form of command that was issued by the immigration service.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.543" offset="1574139">In the Minker case, it was a motion to crush the subpoena which ended in a contempt citation when the respondent refused to appear as ordered by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.158" offset="1640594">This case was taken by the Government to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.107" offset="1656372">And that circuit ruled that the District Court was wrong in deciding that the subpoena should not be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.278" offset="1689078">And the circuit predicated its decision on the fact that the arm of the Immigration and Naturalization Service would be strengthened if the court was to read a broad interpretation into the language of Section 235 (a), and that the Immigration Service would more readily be in a good position to fair it out subversives or those who were seeking under a cloak of recent citizenship to do injury to our Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.176" offset="1832647">They've conceded as the record compel them to do so that there was no evidence or even any inference that the petitioners, Salvatore or Joseph Falcone, had any knowledge of or any participation in -- subversive activities of any kind whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.797" offset="1919164">Now, counsel for the respondent Minker has dwelt on the internal construction of Section 235 (a) and of the Act as a whole as a guide for the interpretation of the power that Congress intended to give the administrative agency by the words which have been added to Section 235 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="507.119" offset="2028460">Counsel pointed out that in changing the word person from alien, there was no intent to enlarge it to the extent that would include citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.655" offset="2082586">That in using the word privilege, the Congress amply used the word that necessarily applies to the position of the alien as he stands in this country but has no reference whatsoever to the position of the citizen who certainly has a right, not a privilege to reside in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.319" offset="2177254">And finally, that the word witness as used by the Congress in the statute didn't necessarily in its common accepted terms and certainly in this field of an area of privacy much more restricted than in regulatory statutes or economic activities of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.648" offset="2266488">And that accordingly, that Congress never intended the word witness to mean a party who would be subject to a revocation act at a later day.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.147" offset="2316539">Finally, respondent counsel has argued a reasonable interpretation of Section 235 that necessarily would result in a restrictive use of that particular proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.925" offset="2403683">Petitioner now, assuming that Section 235 (a) is as broad as the Government contends, would like to point out the power that necessarily flows from such an interpretation into the evasion of the privacy of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.824" offset="2495216">There was mentioned in the fact that there are over 8 million naturalized citizens in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.395" offset="2517577">It seems not unreasonable to plea.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.496" offset="9793933">After conferring the subpoena power -- I'm now referring to page 53 of the Government's brief in the Minker case, the case preceding this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.348" offset="9841371">After referring or granting the subpoena power, for purposes of any matter which is material and relevant to the enforcement of this Act and the administration of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.468" offset="9889855">The Act goes on to provide an enforcement power in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.004" offset="9907931">And the next sentence says, "Any United States District Court within the jurisdiction of which investigations or inquiries are being conducted," and then it goes on to provide for their enforcement of this subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.858" offset="9967386">Now this, I submit, is part of a familiar pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.847" offset="9999360">This pattern of administrative subpoena for investigative purposes, not linked to or limited by the scope of the adjudicating power that the agency may have Mr. Justice Cardozo said, the investigations, these administrative investigations, armed with the subpoena power are quite appropriate even where their objective may be to turn up material for criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.161" offset="10124643">And it's clear that the agencies that have this subpoena power do not have the power to conduct criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.403" offset="10165603">And so here, I say the fact that the Attorney General is only given the power and duty to enforce the revocation provisions in court is no reason for denying his subpoena power but as part of a very old scheme, is appropriate reason to grant it to him when Congress had spoken as we think so clearly.</text>
