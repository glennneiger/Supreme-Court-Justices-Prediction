            <text syncTime="11.893" offset="47543">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.389" offset="69486">This case was brought under the Jones Act that recovered damages for the death of a fireman employed by the Pennsylvania Railroad by reason of the negligence of this defendant railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.049" offset="128104">At the conclusion of the trial before the trial judge and the jury, the trial judge directed a verdict in favor of the defendant and took the case away from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.633" offset="186514">The trial judge in his opinion conceded there was some evidence of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.916" offset="219638">It was also conceded by the trial judge because of the concession by the defense during the course of the trial that there was an accidental death.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.003" offset="263941">But the trial judge felt that there was no causal relation between the negligence and the accidental death.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.802" offset="299154">There was mere speculation and refused to have the jury hear it and make the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.158" offset="328620">On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, it was affirmed on the same question of proximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.639" offset="378462">The major question involved on this appeal is the question as to whether or not there were facts presented from which inferences can be drawn by a jury to show causal relation between the negligence and the accidental death of this deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.199" offset="476787">The facts in this case are quite interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.052" offset="496118">There were no eyewitnesses to this accident, but there are certain facts, physical facts which were proven which I will soon show -- show to the Court, which physical facts are direct evidence and most of the facts to which I will now allude are uncontradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.044" offset="596114">First, and it's not in the order of importance, it's just sending forth these facts and then I'll attempt to correlate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.150" offset="636552">The deceased was found drowned wearing only an underwear and with his shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.547" offset="674168">Next, we have the -- and shoes, just underwear and his shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.251" offset="700918">Next, have the fact that he was found with a searchlight in one of his hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.783" offset="735086">We next have the fact that this man, who was I fireman on this tug, an employee of the defendant railroad, that his clothes, his street clothes were found in the first tug and he was assigned to watch four tugs and the first tug was the Altoona, docked against the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.361" offset="845427">And in the ordinary usual place where he undresses and changes his clothes, they found his street clothes there with the exception of his shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.257" offset="892970">Next, we have the fact, the physical uncontradicted fact that in the same location, in the engine room where he had his street clothes in a bag, was found his working clothes and a little lunch basket all untouched.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.906" offset="979592">We have the next physical fact that the last time he was seen alive was seven o'clock at night when he was walking up the dock towards the Altoona, the vessel which was docked alongside of the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.523" offset="1050018">That was the time he was seen alive, walking towards this vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.386" offset="1069453">All of these facts so far are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.297" offset="1085127">We have additional fact that his duty was to take care of the fires and keep the steam up in the boilers.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.730" offset="1126818">I think this was the Christmas Eve and they were to keep him going until the -- over Christmas until the following day and it's undisputed that with the following day that these tugs continued in the normal course of operation and his job was to keep those fires up, up to the time when his job was to be complete that night and he was to go off duty at one o'clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.859" offset="1235383">At 11 o'clock that night and just to correlate the time, at seven o'clock, he was seen walking towards the Altoona.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.687" offset="1270700">At 11 o'clock, another fireman who was to relieve him on that particular vessel noticed the fires had not been attended to for about three hours, that would bring back the time when he was apparently missing to about eight o'clock or an hour after he was last seen walking towards this vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.197" offset="1364741">And the same fireman who relieved him or was supposed to relieve him on this vessel, found an injector was on.</text>

          <turn speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="351.167" stopTime="430.218">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="351.167" offset="1404656">Injector was on the last vessel, the fourth vessel, which was named Williamsport.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.355" offset="1449378">What is the injector?</text>
            <text syncTime="364.287" offset="1457110">They inject in the cons would be undisputed evidence was apparatus operated manually for the purpose of putting water into the boiler when it needed water and that when the boiler would be dry and needed water that will be some sort of a whistling, sizzling sound which could be heard for half-mile around.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.681" offset="1554704">Now, this injector was on at 11 o'clock that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.646" offset="1578527">It's operated manually to put it on or take it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.568" offset="1594201">The man who, last, was on that vessel before the deceased shows was a man by name of Barker and he testified all in the plaintiff's case that he shut off all the injectors about five o'clock that evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.112" offset="1660447">So that the necessary inferences that there was no one that had put that injector on except Schulz who was the only person who followed Barker upon this vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.270" offset="1705064">That too, I submit to Your Honors are undisputed.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_baker" startTime="436.027" stopTime="670.207">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="436.027" offset="1744039">In the engine room, in the boiler room, that's the Williamsport.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.533" offset="1770057">The defense admitted that there's no foul play.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.510" offset="1802031">They admitted in the record there was no suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.863" offset="1819376">They admitted that the man was sober.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.688" offset="1830661">They admitted his not old man and in all -- other words, they admitted an accidental death, but, of course, denied any causal relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.353" offset="1885309">There are other facts concerning the conditions that existed that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.858" offset="1911432">Some of these are disputed to some extent mainly to proof that the plaintiff provides that there were no rights on the -- on -- on these tugs that it was dark from the outboard side of the Altoona, the first one next to the pier, to the fourth tug out the Williamsport.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.475" offset="1989799">Three or four or more of the witnesses testify to this darkness condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.277" offset="2017071">It was undisputed that none of the witnesses testified that in going from tug to tug they have to use flashlights.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.662" offset="2058553">There was also proof in the case that the deceased was assigned to four tugs that night and that this is not -- time was actually not capable of taking care more of two tugs at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.676" offset="2118635">The evidence indicates that when he was relieved, he was relieved by man who took care of two tugs instead of the four tugs which he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.670" offset="2166596">With these facts, the fact that an accident is admitted, admitted, a fact that there was proof of negligence, some of which may have been disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.502" offset="2229917">It is submitted to Your Honors that there were sufficient facts for which a reasonable inference could be drawn by a jury that the accidental death of the deceased was due to the negligence of this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.674" offset="2294596">I submit to Your Honors that this case is quite similar to the Sadler Case against the Pennsylvania Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.278" offset="2325107">And in that case, it was also quite similar where a man was drowned between several tugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.098" offset="2364291">Thereto, the man that it -- thereto, it was necessary for the person to use flashlights to get around the tugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.176" offset="2396682">There, too, the darkness was the cause of the -- of the injury or death of this man and the Court there held, and I've cited it on page 16 of my brief and was the Fourth Circuit opinion and without reading the law, the Court there held that while it is impossible to say what certainty what cause decedent to fall between the barges, it is a reasonable inference from the evidence that in attempting to go from one to the other, he fell between them as result of the defective lighting.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.699" offset="2566792">We submit, Your Honor, that the reasonable inferences indicate the time when this accident happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.506" offset="2602005">From all of these facts, the jury could have very easily found the time to be between seven and I said 10 o'clock in my brief, I think I can bring it down closest, seven to eight that night because it was 11, they found it was neglected about three hours and brought it down for about eight o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.226" offset="2668878">So between seven and eight o'clock, his death took place.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="673.374" offset="2693433">They found the fires that he was supposed to attend on these tugs below and neglected indicating that there were neglected for a period of about three hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.448" offset="2737737">So that he was missing during those three hours apparently from those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.073" offset="2760202">Now, the place, where could the jury reasonably find a place where this man was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.280" offset="2797087">He certainly wasn't running around the docks in his underwear and his shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.043" offset="2828121">He was on the vessel, the first vessel, the Altoona.</text>

            <text syncTime="719.108" offset="2876395">He was changing his clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.204" offset="2876291">That isn't the question of inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.630" offset="2876186">I think it's direct testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.149" offset="2884545">He had taken off his work -- regular clothes and they were hanging there in the first tug against the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.175" offset="2916624">His work clothes, he still didn't put him on.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.255" offset="2928953">And during the course of changing his clothes, he was compelled to take a search light in his hand and do something, to do something in the requirement from the course of his work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.066" offset="5844219">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.317" offset="5853205">This case is here presenting two questions, whether or not the court below is in conflict with a decision of the Fourth Circuit in Sadler against Pennsylvania Railroad Company and whether or not in holding that proximate cause could not be established by circumstantial evidence and whether or not the court below deviated from the principles annunciated from Lavender v. Kurn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.711" offset="5946828">It is respectfully submitted that neither one of these questions are actually presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.340" offset="5969293">The court below neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals held that proximate cause could not be established by a circumstantial evidence, but explicitly held that this case came within the language in Lavender v. Kurn that there was a complete absence of probative facts which we form evidentiary basis leading to a conclusion that any negligence in the part of the defendant contributed to the death of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.706" offset="6082769">Most of the facts have been developed through extensive use of a discovery and inspection procedure and most of the facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.194" offset="6116728">The decedent was assigned to watch four tugboats on Christmas night, 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.896" offset="6139507">He reported late for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.522" offset="6145985">In the meantime, another watch fireman had been assigned to check these four boats, that watched fireman built up the fires, pump water into the boilers and then turn the injectors off by which he had pumped water into the boilers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.993" offset="6203873">If the concluding of that job on the four boats to which the decedent had been assigned, he met decedent at approximately five o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.117" offset="6236369">They then return to the crew dispatcher's office at which time the decedent announced to the crew dispatcher and the witness, Barker, that he was going to check his boats and he would return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.979" offset="6283912">He did check his boats and he did return to the crew dispatcher's office at seven o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.348" offset="6305332">That is the last that anyone saw of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.895" offset="6319543">When he left the crew dispatcher's office, walking down Pier H towards the four boats to which he had been assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.678" offset="6346710">It was then approximately seven to 07:15 at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.502" offset="6365936">Now from there, there is a almost a complete blank or a complete gap in the evidence with respect to what happened and disputably, the injector was turned off by Mr. Barker at five o'clock and disputably, Andre, the next watchman who came on duty at 11 o'clock found the injector on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.474" offset="6469799">Now, the injector according to the testimony in the record has a two full purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.151" offset="6488503">One, it is used to pump water into the boiler, and two, when the boiler gets hot, it is turn on, the injector is turned on manually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.294" offset="6529149">Again, the -- being to put water into the boiler, but this time the purpose is to all of the steam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.900" offset="6559556">Now, with the respect to the absence of any probative facts as held by the District Court and the Circuit Court, what the petition seeks to do in this case is not supply probative facts by either direct or circumstantial evidence, but he seeks to advance a theory not based on any facts in the record but substituted for facts which was permit reasonable inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.385" offset="6661538">Now, his theory is this, as I understand it from his brief, sometime while the -- while the decedent was changing his clothes preparatory to going to work, an emergency arose on the fourth tug, the outboard tug of the four to which he had been assigned, causing him or making it necessary for him to drop, to stop changing his clothes, pick up his flashlight and cross from the first boat to the fourth boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.317" offset="6773238">Now, what is the nature of the emergency?</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.690" offset="6782746">That is based upon the fact that the injector was found open at 11 o'clock by the next watchman to come on and it indicates that the emergency was, of such a nature, that there was excessive pressure in the boiler indicating, if that were true, it would represent a dangerous situation with respect to that boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.859" offset="6879399">But the undisputed testimony is that if there is excessive pressure in a boiler, each boiler is equipped with the safety valve and that safety valve blows off the excessive steam and thus at least temporarily would eliminate that emergency and that noise, which that safety valve gives off unquestionably from the witnesses' testimony, can be heard for a half-mile and there isn't any evidence in this record and any number of witnesses testified who were in this vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.222" offset="7012833">There was no evidence at all that anyone heard such a noise as would be given off if the safety valve blew.</text>

            <text syncTime="1853.842" offset="7415327">He -- he didn't testify, I beg your pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.599" offset="7422328">He told one of the witnesses that he had checked the boats at seven o'clock and Barker, the fellow who had checked them before him, said that he had fixed the fire so it will run for one-half to two hours, which would take the fire up to about seven o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.046" offset="7484082">In other words, I think it's just as reasonable that Mr. Schulz turn that injector on, on the outboard boat when he went aboard at seven o'clock because that's about the time according to the preceding witness from this -- he would have had attend to those fires because the water would have lasted for an hour and half to two hours when he came on about between six or seven o'clock when he checked his boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.675" offset="7578645">He would have put it on then and sometime in that interim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.610" offset="7610410">Now, Mr. Baker mentioned something about ice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.591" offset="7642279">The only testimony with respect to the ice was one of the witnesses have said that the -- the temperature as far as he recollect was 10 above zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.903" offset="7683553">On page 82 of the record, however, is the official weather report of the temperatures recorded at Battery Place, New York City which is just across the river from Pier H.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.802" offset="7723154">And that weather report shows that the temperature varied from five o'clock in the night in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.231" offset="7744888">It was 40 degrees until sometime later in the day -- later the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.622" offset="7766413">In the afternoon, the temperature kept rising until it was approximately 50 degrees and in middle 50s the following day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.997" offset="7795984">One witness testified there was ice and that was a witness who was assigned to watch boats in the next tier and he testified that he saw ice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.600" offset="7838302">But he testified that the only place he saw the ice was on the front bumping mat -- the front bumping mat of the four boats to which the decedent had been assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.607" offset="7886367">And in connection with that with respect to the lights, it's undisputed that there were two floodlights at the outer end of the pier, 500 watts was used to reflect this which shown down and there are also floodlights from the both head side of the pier from inland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.129" offset="7952509">It was also shown out in the pier and the testimony establishes that those lights illuminated the entire pier and portions of the boat at least at the very least portions of the boat, giving every -- given the benefit of every favorable inference to the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2015.843" offset="8063269">Well, the -- the pier is 600 feet long, sir, and at the end of the pier 600 feet after Milan is a two-storey crew dispatcher's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.478" offset="8097855">On top of which are two floodlights throwing light inland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.693" offset="8114678">The boats which we are concern are approximately 300 feet from that crew dispatcher's shack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.052" offset="8144144">Then, inland another 300 feet is the -- is the boat head and then 125 feet, I believe, further inland are another series or bank of floodlights projecting the light out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.494" offset="8189910">Now, one of the witnesses specifically said that that illuminated the bows of all the boats, but, of course, there were shadows resulting from the superstructures of the tugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.337" offset="8229303">In addition to which the man, of course, carried flashlights as the decedent did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.118" offset="8248424">I think it was found incidentally -- he was found not -- over a month later January 31st.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.597" offset="8274338">He was discovered floating in the water at a pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.481" offset="8285832">I think two piers away from the pier on which he was assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.612" offset="8306416">In the court below, the petitioner strenuously urged that the ice, the presence of ice, the testimony with respect to the ice, was some evidence of negligence which could be causally related to the decedent's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.907" offset="8367543">But in his brief on that point in this Court, that is apparently abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.879" offset="8387500">And it's abandoned because the petitioner apparently agrees with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.936" offset="8411742">He states that concededly there was an ice all over the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.645" offset="8434521">There was an ice all over the docks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.885" offset="8443507">We don't know the place from where the decedent fell, hence, we can't say that -- that the -- that the ice is causally connected with decedent's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.353" offset="8481332">The same exact reasoning, of course, applies to the situation with respect to the lights as the Court of Appeals so stated, that concededly not all the tugs were dark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.935" offset="8527726">The tugs themselves had no lights too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.919" offset="8535667">True, they were taken out of, they were temporarily removed from navigation for two days, but the lights -- the light was supplied by these series of floodlights and as one of the witnesses testified, by the atmospheric conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.784" offset="8579135">That's the witness who testified that seeing the ice on the front bumping mat.</text>

            <text syncTime="2171.585" offset="8686237">Of course, what trouble the District Court, what trouble the Court of Appeals, based on this case of Johnson versus Palma which was in this Court twice once under Rule 50 (b) on a technicality of the motion and the second time, certiorari was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.837" offset="8743288">But the Court of Appeals stated that this case was similar to the Johnson case in which the decedent on the Johnson case was assigned as a float man.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.722" offset="8830851">Now, what he did was leave his tug across the float, release one line and then cross a bridge and release another line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.763" offset="8867004">When he did that, the captain of the ship lost sight of him, but the captain did hear a shout of all gone indicating that the line had been cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.921" offset="8903680">They never found the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.306" offset="8909218">He was missing and some two hours later after they had made a short journey, they came back and the decedent's body was found in the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.999" offset="8939938">Now, in that case, Judge (Inaudible) the District Court rely upon the original opinion of the Court of Appeals which have been reversed on the -- on different grounds stated that the complete absence of any evidence whether it would be circumstantial or direct as to the place of the accident, the wherever of the accident or the how of the accident may avoid a gap in the evidence which in the -- within the language of Lavender v. Kurn presented just the type of case, which there was a complete absence of any probative facts which could form the basis for an inference that any -- any negligence was causally related to the death of the decedent.</text>
