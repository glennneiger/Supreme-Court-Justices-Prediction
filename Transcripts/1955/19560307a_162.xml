            <text syncTime="642.328" offset="2569300">Now, the background of the determination can be summarized very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.649" offset="2586540">What is now part II originated as the Motor Carrier Act of 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.971" offset="2615798">And almost immediately after its enactment, there arose many questions as to what commodities were or were not exempted agricultural commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.138" offset="2656549">The issue arose as to many commodities and arose in informal administrative determinations, informal commission decisions and it was a subject of repeated litigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.756" offset="2698971">The unhappy result was that,13 years later in 1948, there was a good deal of confusion and uncertainty as to the scope of this important exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.569" offset="2746201">Now, in 1948 the Secretary of Agriculture and other persons had made fundamental objections to the Commission's holding in the so-called Harwood case, that vegetables which had been washed, cleaned and packaged were not exempt as agricultural commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.059" offset="2824150">Responding to those representations, the Commission reopened the Harwood case.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.941" offset="2843690">In addition, by the order which -- which appears on page 29 of this record, the Commission directed the investigation and I quote “be made into and concerning the meaning of the words agricultural commodity and not including manufactured products thereof.”</text>
            <text syncTime="728.079" offset="2912235">At the same time, the Commission directed that a hearing be held and to publish notice of the hearing in the federal register.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.278" offset="2941074">In brief, after 13 years of confusion and litigation and interpretation on a case to case and commodity to commodity basis, the Commission sought to arrive at an informed and consistent interpretation applying Section 203 (b) (6) to agricultural commodities as a group.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.393" offset="3033548">So, early in 1948, -- late in 1948 and early in 1949, extensive hearings were held before a hearing examiner who received voluminous evidence from representatives, the Department of Agriculture, and many other interested parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.983" offset="3103869">And after an examiner's report and oral argument before the full Commission, the Commission in 1951 issued its decision in this determination proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.531" offset="3150054">Now, the report consists first of a detailed analysis of the legislative history of the agricultural exemption and Commission resorts extensively to accept its sources of interpretative material in dictionaries, decisions with the Court, particularly this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.586" offset="3234273">And the Commission's report includes an -- an extensive commodity by commodity discussion of the various processes and treatments which are applied in the different agricultural commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.367" offset="3289443">Now, the order at the end of the determination proceeding did not direct named persons to do or not to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.859" offset="3339389">As set forth at page 101 of the record, it simply recites that full investigation of the matters and things involved has been made that the Commission on the date hereof has made and filed its report on oral argument herein containing it's findings of fact and conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.041" offset="3404069">And it has ordered that the proceeding being adhered by is discontinued.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.257" offset="4268931">So this litigation over the determination case began in 1954 on Frozen Foods Express which is a motor carrier and the Secretary of Agriculture filed complaints in the District Court in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.785" offset="4323056">Frozen Foods Express contented in its complaint that the Commission had erred in classifying about 30 commodities as non-exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.356" offset="4365375">That complaint of the Secretary of Agriculture alleged that the Commissioner had erred in classifying eight specified commodities as non exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.987" offset="4407902">The United States, through the Department of Agriculture, supported -- the United States through the Department of Justice supported the position of the Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.763" offset="4446981">And various rail and motor carriers intervened in support of the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.934" offset="4471641">Now, the District Court, as Your Honors know, did not go into the merits and to the correctness of the Commission's decision in the determination case at all.It may in just one holding that the Commission's decision in the determination case was not a reviewable order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.662" offset="4542589">And in -- and in coming to that conclusion, the District Court relied primarily upon this Court's decision in the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad case in 273 U.S., in which this Court held that in order of the Commission of placing a value, a valuation upon railroad property was not subject to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.343" offset="4633287">And the District Court seem to rely heavily upon the classical language from the Los Angeles case that the so-called order here complained of is one which does not command the carrier to do or to refrain from doing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.494" offset="4697966">Now, our position here is that the Commission's determination in this case is distinguishable and its practical impact from the valuation order which was involved in the Los Angeles case, and thus distinguished, we think, it is reviewable under more recent developments in the law of review since the Los Angeles case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.070" offset="4784274">Now, comparing the practical impact of the two types of agency action, the valuation order in the Los Angeles case, as this Court pointed out, could have had no practical impact until there was a raid or some other kind of proceeding before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.734" offset="4854909">And this Court noted specifically that, in the Los Angeles case, it is -- it is at least possible that no proceeding will ever be instituted either before the Commission or at court in which the matter is now complained of will be involved or in which the errors alleged will be of legal significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.742" offset="4922932">And similarly, the evaluation order involved in that case did not leave any carrier even threatened with criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.481" offset="4957832">By contrast in the determination case, the commissioner's decision told motor carriers that they would be subject to criminal and civil enforcement proceedings if they carried commodities which the Commission classified as non-exempt without obtaining appropriate certificates or permits of public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.679" offset="5070681">The total motor carriers designed to carry such certificates that they must go to the expense in the inconvenience, and I regret to say, considerable period of time involved in obtaining appropriate certificates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.505" offset="6165943">Because Section 204 specifically provides that the Commission shall administer, execute and enforce all provisions of this part and empowers it to make all necessary orders and connection therewith and to prescribe rules, regulations and procedure for such administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.631" offset="6242429">In Federal Communications Commission, the American Broadcasting Company in 347 U.S., this Court held that on almost identical grant of rule making power, almost verbatim, empowered the Federal Communications Commission to issue what were labeled as interpretative rules in purporting to interpret a criminal -- lottery provision of the Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.476" offset="6353816">And it was stated in these interpretative regulations of FCC, I think that that -- that that Commission would use them as a guide in -- in the exercise of its license -- licensing powers and particularly in the exercise of its power to review, to renew or not to review broadcast licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.600" offset="6442318">And in that case, the -- the interpretative regulations, labeled as such, issued by the Communications Commission after a hearing, were reviewed by a three-judge District Court and by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.811" offset="6499161">In the suit upon injunction, or without any actual attempt at enforcement of the regulations, either criminally or in actual licensing proceedings, and in event, the case stands for the proposition we believe that the Interstate Commerce Commission, under a similar statutory provision, has been authorized by Congress to issue interpretations of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.139" offset="6612532">Now, we don't think it should be decisive whether the Commission's decision in the -- in the interpretation case is labeled as a rule or as an order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.347" offset="7113352">Now, the Commission has the power and the duty to interpret and -- and apply the agricultural commodity exemption in two types of cases of adjudication within the meaning of the Procedure Act in which a hearing is required the, first, cease and desist proceedings, and secondly, in determining applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.687" offset="7210736">So, it seems to us that the scope and application of the agricultural commodity exception, which the Commission has authorized by statue to determine after a hearing in two types of cases, is an issue which the Commission is empowered by Section 5 (d) of the Procedure Act to determine in a declaratory order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.478" offset="7293910">Even assuming what Section 5 (d) does not make to clear, but assuming that a declaratory order may be issued only after a hearing, well then in this case, the Commission held a hearing, an evidentiary hearing before it issued -- before it made its decision in determination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.877" offset="7375412">And the clear purpose of the determination, after 13 years of uncertainty, it clearly was to terminate controversies and to remove uncertainties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.853" offset="7423373">The legislative history of Section 5 (d) of the Procedure Act is quite sparse.</text>

            <text syncTime="3187.213" offset="12748800">I simply say, the starting with the language of this provision, which resulted from amendments from the floor, and therefore don't show any clear cohesive interpretation which don't include any definition of section which will be found for example in the price control acts in which there is a similar provision that is necessary to resort to extrinsic aids.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.390" offset="12841482">Without laboring the point, we have pointed out that those extrinsic aids include both the legislative history prior to the Act in which the intention of Congress or its purpose in providing regulation is made clear and also its purpose in extending to farmers, the aid in getting their products to market of not having to use the ordinary commercial means of transportation can be reconciled through an understanding of the fundamental basis on which they approach this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.504" offset="12981917">Secondly, there is a great deal of help to be found in what we call contemporaries usage of these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.484" offset="13017861">There is no issue in the case of what dressed poultry is not a farm product when it is dressed and when it is frozen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.102" offset="13044402">These two different commodities are recognized by the parties as being primarily the production of commercial packets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.150" offset="13072509">So, in looking at the literal definitions which have been urged on the Commission and on the court below and now in this Court, for interpretation of this language and particularly the -- the decisions of this Court as to the meaning of manufacturing, we have a situation where a tax statute in Richmond, Virginia, for example, can say that -- that meat cutting is not manufacturing and yet we can look at a federal statute and we can look at a classification manual in the federal government's usage and find that meat cutting is manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.392" offset="13205525">So, again, I say we have not a clear question, not anything that can be solved by resort to dictionary definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.688" offset="13234678">In our brief and in the transcript, we set forth the evidence which was offered to the Commission in the complaint case which was not before the Commission except in part in the determination case, showing that since 1929, in the NRA codes and in classification indicia which the Government departments' organized for statistical purposes, meat cutting and the meat -- the processing industry and the poultry processing industry have been classified as manufacturing enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.364" offset="13353378">Now, I am not here to state that the congressman who offered that amendment from the floor knew that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.554" offset="13370201">I am saying, however, there was a contemporaneous usage which squares with the idea that when they changed the word "processed" to manufactured, they were not intending to extend that agricultural exemption to the meat packing industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3446.046" offset="13784085">The Kroblin was brought in Iowa where there is a different kind of chicken production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.197" offset="13800699">There, the chickens would go to market for meat purposes are the (Inaudible) and the surplus females from the farm flocks which are maintained for egg raising purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.088" offset="13836330">So that we had a farm there which was perhaps not complete universal in its understanding of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.611" offset="13862348">Finally, I wish to make this one final point, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.945" offset="13875722">We've had a big question as -- as to what Congress has done since this problem arose and one side contends and the Kroblin decision rests almost entirely on the proposition that Congress felt that the Commission's decision was to hold that poultry was exempt and that the Congress has ratified that by refusing to make a change in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.012" offset="13967987">Actually, such -- such help as we can get on the doctrine, a ratification by Congress is I think very important because as shown in our brief, the Congress was advised in 1950, 1952 twice, that the Commission was holding poultry to be a regulated commodity, not within the scope of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.922" offset="14043638">The Secretary of Agriculture is represented as Congress specifically to change the Act so as to make poultry exempt and Congress did amend the Act to add the phrase and horticultural, the parenthetical phrase that appears right after agriculture, that was the amendment 1952 or 1953 after this was -- was made known to them in public hearings by then which the Commission's spokesman as a witness, Secretary of Agriculture had a spokesman who was a witness, and I, unfortunately, was also a witness because I found myself misquoted in the Kroblin decision and the result of it was Congress ratified the decision of the Commission by refusing to change the Act and leaving poultry under regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3639.210" offset="14556787">In both of these cases, the Department of Agriculture intervened and we have attempted in the determination case and also in the other case to express our views on the matter and so for first as relating to the determination case, my situation is a little different from that of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.454" offset="14681757">I want this Court to hold that it is an appealable order and then I want a court to hold that the Commission had no authority to enter it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.617" offset="14726374">We had this situation, the United States of America through the Solicitor General confessed error in both of these cases and insofar as it related to the items of slaughtered meat animals and fresh meats, dressed and cut off poultry, fresh or frozen, feathers, raw shell peanuts and raw shell nuts and other items I believe a total of nine in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.135" offset="14880496">The matter of the exemption provision, it is in the interpretation or in the definition section of the Motor Carrier Act Part II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.355" offset="14941414">It takes away from the Commission that nothing in this party except the provisions of 204 relative to the qualification and maximum hours of service of the employees and safety of operation shall be construed to include.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.462" offset="15025842">Now, these are things that the -- the Congress took away from the Interstate Commerce Commission insofar as the certificate section, insofar as the permit or the rate section is concerned and said they shall be exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.387" offset="15097522">One of them is -- motor vehicles controlled and operated by any farmer when used in the transportation of his agricultural commodities and products thereof or in the transportation of supplies to his farm that is in addition to the exemption that is -- that is contained in a subparagraph 6 which reads, motor vehicles used in carrying property consisting of ordinary livestock, fish, including shellfish, are agricultural commodities parenthetically not including manufactured products thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.958" offset="15291768">Now, in addition, Congress put this further safety or -- or exemption on it if such motor vehicles are not used in carrying any other property or passengers for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.603" offset="15370344">Now, it -- it is our position that -- that is a -- a phrase that is not susceptible of anything except an ordinary interpretation and that is an agriculture commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.995" offset="15431889">And that in the question of the determination case, it was not the intention of Congress so far as this part of the Act was concerned, to want to aid the farmers because they put another provision and that to helped the farmers anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.128" offset="15500434">But I advice my clients that under the law, if we felt that we had the -- the right to transport in the 48 States in the District of Columbia any agricultural commodity, so long as it did not constitute a manufactured product thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.233" offset="15584862">Now, these cases are so intertwined, I hope the court will forgive me if I go from one to the other, but I want to -- in -- in connection with the determination case, I want to read what the court or the Interstate Commerce Commission said as found on page 11 of our brief in 158 insofar as the complaint case was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.707" offset="15714743">The Interstate Commerce Commission said on its -- in the record 35, the facts before us in this preceding are more complete as they relate to this particular issue than those before us in the exemption case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.078" offset="15788304">But they contain nothing to warrant any different conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3958.873" offset="15835429">Then they also said, until a final decision contrary to the findings in the exemption case is reached by the courts, we adhere to the conclusion that the transportation of fresh and frozen meats and fresh and frozen dressed poultry are subject to the certificate and permit requirements of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4005.349" offset="16021316">Now, let me pass from that just a moment to the opinion that was expressed by Judge Connelly and the-three judge federal court in the Southern District of Texas contained on page 55 of the record in 162.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.167" offset="16128627">Talking about the Los Angeles Railroad company case whether or not this is an appealable order, the so-called order here complained of is one which does not command the carrier to do or to refrain from doing anything which does not grant or withhold any authority, privilege or license, which does not intend, extend or bridge any power or facility and which does not subject to carry it to any liability civil or criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.857" offset="16271360">Now, let me lay that test down to the case we have under consideration here, because if this determination case stands so to speak as the Sword of Damocles over the heads of anybody who seek to transport these commodities without the certificate provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.638" offset="16374491">What happened to us when sought to transport these commodities, we were subjected immediately to a complaint before the Interstate Commerce Commission and as a result of the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission, we were given a cease and desist order to where we could no longer transport those commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.944" offset="16483683">Now, certainly, whether you call it an order or a finding or what not, the effect of the determination case on the transportation industry today and on those who seek to hold these commodities without regulation or certificates or tariffs has the same portion effect as any kind of an order whether you ended it as so ordered and so forth or whether or not it is contained in the same language and cast in the same language that it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.163" offset="16620565">And we respectfully submit to the court that so long as the determination order is left as it is, either saying that the Commission did not have the authority to enter the order and regulating these commodities or saying that they did have the authority and that the carriers who seek to transport these commodities will have to abide by them, we then must go constantly into the courts and seek an interpretation or a determination of each of the commodities that we think constitute agricultural commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.461" offset="16785763">That, of course, is a bad situation insofar as my client is concerned because we were experiencing a terrific loss of business to these people who were operating without regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.069" offset="16856189">And it was -- we had certificates as the record shows to operate transporting -- in 17 States items ordinarily constituting frozen foods which move under refrigeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.835" offset="16931318">But little by little, here, somebody started carrying these commodities in those and they took them away from us to where as I have previously mentioned to this court and I advise my client that upon an examination of the order and upon an examination of the law that we felt that we had the authority without going to the Interstate Commerce Commission of transporting those commodities which we had the cease and desist order issued against us.</text>

            <text syncTime="5590.163" offset="22360607">Let me repeat, the way this section originated, the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee reported the Senate Bill for the proposed amendment to observe the transportation of unprocessed agricultural commodities.</text>

            <text syncTime="5669.080" offset="22676271">Yes, so that the exemption applies to processed commodities if the processing does not exceed that involved in pasteurizing milk or ginning cotton.</text>
            <text syncTime="5685.450" offset="22741786">I think we can look at what the processes which milk has undergone and still on the basis of that Commission's ruling in the determination case be not manufactured and be still within the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.326" offset="22825273">It held that this was true as to milk which had been pasteurized, homogenized, standardized and with vitamin concentrates added.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.295" offset="22881176">The Commission's report shows what these processes involved.Pasteurization is heating the milk to a sufficiently high temperature and for sufficient period of time to kill the germs in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.860" offset="22955363">Homogenization is a process to reduce the fat, the size of the fat globules in the milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5747.229" offset="22988904">Standardization is adding skimmed milk so as to reduce the milk's percentage of butter fat content to the minimum standard required by state law and adding vitamins adds components similar to those already in the milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5769.588" offset="23078348">I find it difficult to reconcile the Commission's conclusion that these extensive operations which it found were almost always carried on in dairies rather than on the farm, did not result in manufactured product, but the killing, the feathering and cleaning of chicken makes it a manufactured product.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.176" offset="23200601">Now, it has been argued that this Act should be construed as a whole and that its overall purpose was to curd the evil of over competition in the motor carrier industry.We do not dispute either of these propositions but in viewing the Act as a whole, it is necessary to bear in mind that Congress placed expressed limitations on the transportation which was made subject to the Commission's regulatory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5840.228" offset="23360888">The purpose which underlies these limitations must be as much respected as the purpose underlying the grant of general authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.536" offset="23414073">There is not much doubt as to the general mood in this position of Congress when it enacted Section 203 (b) (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.772" offset="23451063">It not only changed the committee bill, so as to include under it processed agricultural commodities, it adapted two other broadening amendments to the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="5880.530" offset="23522116">It also, as General Phinney mentioned, provided a separate exemption for farmers operating their vehicles to carry agricultural commodities or to carry supplies to their farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.801" offset="23603200">And they say that it -- as the section was originally proposed, the Commission could have in effect set it aside if it found they'd tended to defeat the transportation policy of Congress as declared in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5920.436" offset="23681672">This was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5923.079" offset="23692225">Congress said that it did not want to leave this matter to the discretion of the Commission, that it intended it to be mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5933.977" offset="23735902">The Commission has consistently given this section a restrictive interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5941.401" offset="23765577">In eight out of ten cases in the federal courts under the section, its interpretation has been found unduly restrictive and erroneous, and four of the eight cases, the matter went to the Court of Appeals and I mentioned that in each of these cases, the District Court, as well as the Court of Appeals, downed against the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5972.051" offset="23888144">Under the word "fish", it said that if a fish had its head cut off, it was no longer within the exemption, nothing more than head cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.066" offset="23940180">And we have heard that shelling of peanut makes it manufactured.In the Kroblin case, the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit held that dressed poultry is within the agricultural exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="6000.010" offset="23999948">It said that the position of the Commission was simply that as a matter of giving the motor carrier regulation as wide as scope is possible, a chicken should be regarded as converted into a manufactured product when its head is cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="6017.331" offset="24069224">The court said that neither the language, nor the spirit of the exemption warrant that any such artificial concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="6029.003" offset="24115931">Now, some reliance is placed on the established rule that agency interpretation of a statute is to be given special consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="6042.198" offset="24168699">This does not mean that the courts blindly accept administrative construction without regard to the factors which do or do not give it weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="6054.826" offset="24219272">And the Skidmore case 323 U.S., the Court said that the weight of agency interpretation depends upon the evidence there -- evidence in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning and its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.821" offset="24311223">Now, I submit that by this test, the Commission's ruling is that dressed poultry is entitled to very little weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="6086.770" offset="24347063">Our brief points out that the Commission has reached its conclusion as to dressed poultry on three entirely different grounds that it subsequently itself decided that the first two of these grounds were erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.622" offset="24414459">Now, its third ground, given in the determination case and repeated in the present complaint case, was that since the words ordinary livestock embraced only the live cattle, it logically follows that the words agricultural commodities embrace only live poultry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6129.392" offset="24517486">But the boundary of the exemption as to agricultural commodities is fixed by what becomes manufactured, not by continued life, any harvested crop is no longer living whether it's cotton, wheat, tobacco or poultry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6157.406" offset="24629603">The Commission's ruling is -- ignores the source of the exemption and it represents a mere speculative inference as to what it would have been logically for Congress to have provide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.991" offset="24715912">I submit that this is very treacherous ground for statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.983" offset="24743915">It seems to me, if we are to consider that question, that there is sufficient differences between the Manifold products and byproducts resulting from slaughter of cattle, sheep, and swine with reference to transporting these products from the point of slaughter and exemption of transportation of poultry which has been prepared for market merely by being killed, feathered and cleaned.</text>
