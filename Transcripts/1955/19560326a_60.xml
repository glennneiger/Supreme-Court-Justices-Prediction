            <text syncTime="14.405" offset="57574">This case involves the review of a conviction for income tax evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.080" offset="80248">On May 28th, 1954, the petitioner was indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on three counts of willfully attempting to evade his income taxes for the years 1951, 1952, and 1953 by filing false and fraudulent returns, understating the taxes due and owing to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.863" offset="175438">There was endorsed on the indictment, Section 145 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 as the statute violated by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.900" offset="215562">This statute provides that any person who willfully attempts, in any manner, to evade or defeat his taxes, shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction shall be fined not more than $10,000 on prison for not more than five years or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.369" offset="281391">After a jury trial, petitioner was found guilty as charged on all counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.142" offset="304483">On October 28th, 1954, the District Court entered its judgement of conviction on each count and sentenced petitioner to four years imprisonment on each count, the terms to run concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.938" offset="355683">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed these convictions on all counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.736" offset="378880">The evidence summarized show that the alleged unreported income consisted entirely of funds misappropriated from petitioner's employer, the St. Louis Labor Health Institute, which is a medical center providing medical care and dental care to services -- to members of Teamsters' Local 688 in St. Louis, Missouri, and which institute is supported by financial contributions from employers who have in effect collective bargaining agreements with Teamsters Local 688 in the Greater St. Louis area.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.263" offset="517016">Petitioner was a business manager of the institute.He authorized expenditures.He signed and he drew checks on the institute's bank account.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.092" offset="552333">The unreported income, alleged and accepted by the jury as true, came from the amounts which he paid out of the institute's funds, amounts which he paid through a certain subcontractor for work and labor which petitioner knew as a matter of fact had never been done, and which amounts on receipt by the subcontractor were turned back by the subcontractor to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.720" offset="654838">He also paid out institute funds and the other aspect of the -- of the unreported income was funds that he had paid out to another subcontractor for painting and the building of a ratskeller in his personal residence, that is the signing of checks and the paying out of his employer's funds by work done purely at his personal residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.210" offset="740833">The amount of taxes evaded was $757 in 1951, $458 in 1952, and $209 in 1953.On each of the three tax evasion counts, the trial court refused to give an instruction, requested by petitioner, which would have told the jury that it could find petitioner guilty of a lesser crime based upon Section 3616 (a) of the Revenue Code of 1939 and Rule 31 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.782" offset="883043">Section 3616 (a) provides that any person who delivers or discloses to a collector any false or fraudulent return with intent to defeat or evade the assessment intended to be made shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be subject to a $1000 fine or one year imprisonment or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.328" offset="961306">Rule 31 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the defendant may be found guilty of an offense necessarily included in the offense charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.121" offset="1004460">Specifically, this requested instruction would have told the jury to find the petitioner guilty of a misdemeanor under Section 3616 (a) if it believed that he, the petitioner, the defendant had delivered a false income tax return to the collector with intent to defeat or evade the assessment of his tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.386" offset="1085544">The Court of Appeals rule adversely to the petitioner on -- on this issue relying on its earlier case of Dillon versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.280" offset="1117100">The rationale of the Dillon case is that no lesser instruction was required because Section 3616 (a) is inapplicable to income tax violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.023" offset="1156075">This review here this afternoon is limited to the single question, whether if the trial court should have instructed the jury, the petitioner, who had been indicted for the felony of attempted evasion of income taxes, that is according to the statute endorsed on the indictment, could be convicted of a misdemeanor of filing a fraudulent return with intent to defeat the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.515" offset="1250011">Now, at the outset, I think that it will be helpful to the Court if on behalf of the petitioner, I state certain very elementary and certain basic propositions with which the petitioner and the Government are in full and complete accord.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.574" offset="1306227">First, both are agreed that the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit was wrong in holding Section 3616 (a) inapplicable to income tax violations, its legislative history, its collocation in the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.157" offset="1380624">The tacit acceptance by various lower federal courts of the applicability of 3616 to income tax violations and the Government's own use of it to punish certain what it deems in "minor income tax violations" has led the Government to this concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.547" offset="1466096">Secondly, both are agreed that the allegations of the indictment charging offense under Section 3616 (a) as well as under Section 145 (b), the indictment charges a willful attempt to evade income taxes by filing fraudulent returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.260" offset="1536940">It is agreed that both statutes punished exactly the same Act and both punished such a willful attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.780" offset="1567033">Thirdly, it is agreed that the Government's proof would support a conviction under Section 3616 (a), as well as under Section 145 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="401.895" offset="1607576">And lastly, the petitioner and the Government are in perfect agreement that each offense charged here, the felony and the misdemeanor, does not, and I emphasize that again, does not require the proof of a fact not essential to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.282" offset="1669120">And that under the test laid down by this Court in Pereira versus United States, double jeopardy attaches here so that the Government cannot prosecute and could not have prosecuted this petitioner for both offenses, that is the felony and the misdemeanor.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.351" offset="2241306">The area of dispute begins with the Government's seeking to confine the application of Rule 31 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil -- of Criminal Procedure to the single situation that a lesser offense instruction is entitled, that the defendant is entitled to a lesser offense instruction only where there exist a gradation of offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.518" offset="2326047">That is a situation in which the greater offense alleged contains -- contains the same elements as a lesser offense plus some aggravating ingredient not found in the lesser included offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1433.023" offset="5731997">So, maybe the question is we send him back to resentencing under the, what I call the lesser offense and the trial judge, the -- the misdemeanor and the trial judge would sentence him in accordance with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.479" offset="5773897">That is true, if the Court accepts the Government's hypothesis that there is no difference between the two statutes, and that they both require exactly the same proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.371" offset="5817469">Now, as the Court will see in our main brief, I have made the suggestion that it is most difficult, and I have nothing at all to go on except a -- an analogy between murder and manslaughter that perhaps if there is a difference between the two, perhaps there is a difference and maybe the difference is in the different required quantum of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.670" offset="5898658">But as I say, there is nothing in legislative history to suggest that it was merely an attempt to perhaps find some way of accommodating these two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.320" offset="5933244">But if the Government's position is correct that they cover exactly the same things, that wouldn't be true at all, and the question here is primarily one of what prejudice was there to the defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.249" offset="5972950">The only prejudice is that perhaps he could have been -- perhaps he was found guilty of the lesser offense and perhaps he should have been sentenced under what I call a lesser offense, so we'll send him back for resentencing and there's no need for a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.715" offset="6022792">And that is certainly a position which could be taken, if under the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.523" offset="6042018">I think it's -- it's the logical result of the Government's position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.421" offset="6133656">What the Government wants, they want this happy little situation where they can prosecute A, under a misdemeanor, he's not such a bad fellow, he only took six extra dependents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.571" offset="6214217">And the only thing that the Government tells us in this brief and -- and the only safeguard, and the only ascertainable standard that they suggest on Footnote 14 at page 30 is the supervision of the Justice Department in a high degree of discretion to be be rendered by the United States Attorney by the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.164" offset="6284643">To -- to me, that doesn't seem satisfactory, and that is our basic objection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1741.301" offset="6965185">It's not a -- it's not a -- a recent case, it's an old case, but I think it illustrates what at least I mean by a lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.675" offset="6998622">I think you'll find the case, it's -- it's an old case, United States versus Dickson, page 18 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.692" offset="7022759">The Government tells us that here is a familiar illustration of what we mean by a "lesser included offense."</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.937" offset="7047732">When an indictment for burglary supports a conviction for larceny but the jury isn't satisfied as to the breaking and entering during the nighttime, so the Government tells us, "Well, it's all right in that case to return the conviction for larceny."</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.542" offset="7098096">Now, if you read that case carefully, as I read it, at that time, burglary carried the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.393" offset="7125473">As a matter of fact, the judge call this defendant back several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.531" offset="7138116">He said, "Do you know what you're doing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.706" offset="7142818">You're pleading guilty to something that you could be sentenced to death warrant."</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.937" offset="7159745">Finally, he withdrew his plea of guilty and he went to trial on a burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.816" offset="7175210">Now, I ask you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.790" offset="7187122">Can element for element, is larceny a constituent offense under burglary?</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.459" offset="7209796">I submit that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.102" offset="7216379">That burglary requires the breaking and entering the dwelling house to another at night with intent to commit a felony therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.613" offset="7242397">It doesn't require any taking and carrying away of the personal property of another, and I submit that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.059" offset="7268206">That if you accept the Government's own interpretation, that their reliance on this case is misplaced, but, I think that the Dickson case, and I say it's only an old case, 1807 Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.605" offset="7318361">The only way that that case will be explained is that the indictment charged the larceny with taking and carrying away in -- as a lesser offense as something within the indictment, less than the burglary, that the jury wasn't satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.139" offset="7384503">And the only way that that page can be explained is that the larceny carried with it a penalty of 39 stripes, with the whip, as contrast with the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.874" offset="7423478">And in this sense, it was a lesser included offense because it was charged with an indictment, and that is our basic quarrel with a gradation theory as -- as put forth here by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.764" offset="7467050">It was a -- logically, there's no reasoning, there's no authority for it, that if you're not going to be bound by the statute number, if the prosecution can convict under any statute, then the defendant should be able to rely on any statute which the indictment charges and which the allegation support, especially if it's a lesser offense and we say that this is not only fair to the defendant, but it's just as fair to the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.362" offset="7561404">Why should the defendant be acquitted?</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.953" offset="7571749">Simply because element for element, every allegation in the indictment isn't proved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.190" offset="8616751">This agreement is -- as to what should be done in the case of overlapping criminal statutes, in the case of two statutes which are not identical, two statutes which are not co-extensive, but which to a substantial extent overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.296" offset="8697104">Now, in most cases that have come before this Court in involving overlapping statutes, the -- the Court has been confronted with an argument that a later statute dealing with a more specific subject matter, carrying a lesser penalty has repealed or superceded an earlier statute which is more general, which carries a more severe penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.582" offset="8810266">That was the situation in the Gilliland case and in the Novak case, and this Court has recognized that overlapping provisions in the federal common law -- in the federal criminal law are a common place that the penal provisions in the United States Code are not like a mosaic or a jigsaw puzzle in which every piece neatly interlocks which there are no gaps and no overlaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.139" offset="8932519">That isn't the basis on which legislation is enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.233" offset="8948924">Congress enacts legislation to meet a particular need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.801" offset="8971180">And in the field of frauds upon the United States in the field of making a false statements to -- to representatives, agencies of the United States, Congress has been especially, or shall I say, zealous, to prevent any loopholes in its legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.692" offset="9038681">And the result is that Congress has not only acted abundantly, it's acted redundantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.980" offset="9067833">And the -- and here we have the same statute, 1939 Revenue Code, which in one section, 145 (b) makes it a felony to attempt willfully, to evade taxes, income taxes, only I should say, I should mention and I stress it because 145 (b) doesn't apply to any other kind of federal taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.337" offset="9157277">145 (b) says that as to income taxes, evasion in any form is a felony, and that 99% of the cases that have arisen under 145 (b), the evasion has taken the form of filing a false and fraudulent return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.813" offset="9239197">In 3616 (a) of the same statute, Congress has said that the filing was a delivery of any tax return, not merely income tax returns, but all tax returns shall be a misdemeanor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.144" offset="9664575">If there is a repeal, it -- intent of Congress to repeal must be clear and manifest that there must be a positive repugnancy between the old provisions and the new provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.688" offset="9718700">Now, here, all we have is a redundancy, not between old and new provisions but in the same statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.227" offset="9816816">It goes beyond 145 (b) which is limited to income tax evasions 145 (b), however, is more comprehensive than 3616 (a) because it covers all evasions even those not involving the filing of false return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.215" offset="9880764">Now, there is a difference between the two.</text>

            <text syncTime="2476.166" offset="9904588">Now, as to the income tax, there was a very good reason for Congress to be especially alert to impose a severe penalty because the income tax law, as the Court had said in several cases, is based on a system of voluntary disclosure of self-assessment.</text>
