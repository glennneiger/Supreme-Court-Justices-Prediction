            <text syncTime="54.040" offset="216085">In that case, there was an application by a Boston Station for an increase in power, the effect of which if granted would be to constitute an interference with the Denver Station KOA and to that extent a modification of the KOA clear channel license.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.336" offset="305319">And under then Section 312 (b) of the Act a modification of license could not be effected without affording the licensee an opportunity to show cause why it should not be modified.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.599" offset="3234377">That leads me directly into -- into the second branch of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.071" offset="3256216">Because it is our contention here as it was in the court below that these numerical proscription rules are invalid not only because they deny the hearing under Section 309 (b) but because they are arbitrary in that they exclude required consideration of relevant factors and their basis is not adequately disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.932" offset="3367706">Now, I pointed out to Your Honors yesterday that the order promulgating these rules was founded upon the anti-trust sections of the Communications Act and that the Commission had had ceased two aspects of that, the program diversification policy and the policy preventing undue concentration of economic control.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.206" offset="3452761">I think I also pointed out that the anti-trust provisions of the Communications Act merely declare applicable to radio, all the laws of the United States relating to unlawful restraints and monopolies and the combinations, contracts or agreements in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.438" offset="3525695">In other words, there isn't any legislation, anti-trust legislation applicable to radio which is not also applicable to all industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.139" offset="3572506">And the anti-trust laws, both statutory and as they have been construed by the Court do not proscribe any acquisition except upon the basis of actual or potential effect upon competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.228" offset="3644813">And determination of the effect upon competition requires consideration of a variety of factors, requires consideration of the purpose of the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.970" offset="3687863">The size and location of the acquiring interest and of the acquired interest, the existence and strength of competitors in the market affected as this Court pointed out in the Columbia Steel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.904" offset="3739585">We look to the percentage of business control, the strength of the remaining competition whether the action springs from business requirements or purpose to monopolize the probable development of the industry, consumer demands, and other characteristics of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.918" offset="3803638">These rules make one factor, multiple ownership controlling to the exclusion of all other relevant factors, although the multiple ownership rules themselves in the sections immediately preceding the numerical proscription hereunder attack expressly recognize differences as the rule state in size, extent, and location of areas served, differences in numbers of people served, differences in the extent of other competitive service to the areas in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.589" offset="3966328">I ask Your Honors to consider these numerical proscription rules in the light of those three factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.635" offset="4010527">First, size, extent, and location of areas served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.545" offset="4030171">These rules do not take that factor into account at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.677" offset="4050651">Indeed, they create an arbitrary and false presumption that a T.V. station in say, Butte, Montana is to be equated because it's one with the T.V. station in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.767" offset="4123063">The rules ignore completely the factor of the number of people served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.895" offset="4151484">Now, in that connection, Your Honor, there is a footnote reference in the Government's reply brief at page 14 -- at page 14, referring presumably in an effort to show the salutary effect of these rules in preventing undue expansion of Storer to the fact that the metropolitan areas served by Storer's television stations have a population of some seven million persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.317" offset="4309264">Now, that statistic is not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.705" offset="4326818">It is not -- it has not been referred to previously in this proceeding, but it is based upon the 1950 census of the metropolitan areas which are, in fact, served by Storer's T.V. station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.791" offset="4395154">And therefore, I think it appropriate to call to Your Honors' attention, using the same 1950 census figures, the fact that there are other multiple owners operating under exactly the same multiple ownership rules serving vastly larger populations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.130" offset="4480418">DuMont for example, 14 million, General Teleradio, 20 million, Columbia Broadcasting, 23 million, National Broadcasting, 27 million, American Broadcasting, 28 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.987" offset="4547918">I think that illustrates one of the points of attack here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.583" offset="4566309">Because if for example, American Broadcasting gave up one of its five T.V. stations, say in San Francisco, with a metropolitan population of approximately two million, thereby reducing its population statistic to 26 million, it would be eligible to receive a license for a new station for which Storer, with its seven million statistic would be ineligible to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.017" offset="4695980">The third factor and perhaps the most important in the light of the -- of our purposes of these rules, the extent of other competitive service to the areas in question, a factor which is totally disregarded by these numerical proscription rules that points out the fact that they are not at all related to the alleged policy, I shouldn't say alleged policy, to the policy of program diversification which is alleged as a basis for the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.946" offset="4831713">Because they preclude consideration of the view points and programs available in any given area that they operate and apply only the stations serving different areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.700" offset="4890749">Let me illustrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.593" offset="4906318">The service area of the T.V. station can be measured by a radius of approximately 60 miles maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.567" offset="4950204">An application is made for a license to operate a station in Miami, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.452" offset="4973714">The fact that an applicant has an interest in a station, a T.V. station in Detroit, Michigan, and have no possible relationship, the program diversification either in Miami or in Detroit or in anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.078" offset="5052291">These rules exclude a multiple owner from areas in which there are more facilities when there are applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.339" offset="5101296">Indeed, by their expressed terms, they would exclude an otherwise qualified applicant, a multiple owner, in an area not served by any existing facility, even if there were not any other applicant for facility there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.801" offset="5175171">If those factors which I have referred to and which are in the multiple ownership rules themselves are relevant in considering an increase in number of stations from four to five, why aren't they equally relevant in considering an increase from five to six.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.643" offset="5258553">What is the magic of the number five or the number seven?</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.176" offset="5280601">I hope Your Honors will direct that questions specifically to Mr. Baker because up to this point there hasn't been the slightest attempt to meet that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.570" offset="5322188">There isn't any attempt by the Commission here to relate the specific limitations which they have adopted, either to the anti-monopoly policy or to the program diversification policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.111" offset="5384359">Now, in that connection, I don't want to be unfair to the Commission in any respect and I would like therefore to confine my comments here for those reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.484" offset="5433887">That the precise language used by the Commission in its report, in ostensible support for these limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.840" offset="5475265">First, in the case of AM, the number seven was selected, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.234" offset="5504836">In order that the present holdings of such stations be not unduly disrupted, clearly, no relationship in that to the avowed purposes of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.322" offset="5565231">In the case of FM, this is at page 31 of the record, the number seven was selected, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.872" offset="5595429">Because it is considered desirable to have the same limitation applicable to both AM and FM.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.305" offset="5629179">Now what relationship does that have to the avowed purposes of the rules?</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.585" offset="5650286">And finally at page 30 of the record in the case of T.V. the number five is selected because it is the existing limitation on T.V. station ownership which in our judgment based on extensive experience with the problems of multiple ownership have proven practicable and desirable and that's it and that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.960" offset="5759791">Not only is that unrelated to the avowed purposes of the rule, that statement with reference to television is a meaningless abstraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.573" offset="5802214">The Commission points to and can point to, no instance whatever of any experience with ownership in more than the specified number of television stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.995" offset="5863967">There isn't any basis shown in the Commission's report or in the record for the specific limits which the Commission has imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.257" offset="5956963">In that connection I should like to call Your Honors' attention to a statement which I think significant by Commissioner Dorfman in 1954 in connection with the modification so as to provide two additional ultrahigh frequency stations as distinguished from VHF stations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.555" offset="7770175">Until the end of 1953, some four years after the -- the arguments on the question, the Commission came out with these rules effective 1954.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.196" offset="7888771">And I submit that Your Honors will find absolutely nothing beyond what I have read to you which purports to support those limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.910" offset="7927536">Now the Commission, in its report, did take cognizance of the widespread criticism of the proposed rules that they were arbitrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.126" offset="8032444">In view of the arguments advanced by some party that the proposed rules are arbitrary and that they give no effect to class and size of stations, geographical locations, populations served, and similar factors, we have considered alternatives to the present proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.848" offset="8107363">But as a result of the study of the present holdings of multiple owners, we have concluded that any proposal to limit multiple ownership on the basis of such factors as class of station, geographical location is either unsatisfactory or unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.182" offset="8180715">Now, I submit that that observation would reasonably justify a conclusion that no formula should be adopted but it clearly does not justify the conclusion that an arbitrary formula can be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.398" offset="8241528">These rules in our view are invalid because they repudiate the congressional intent that anti-trust questions be determined on the basis of the facts with respect to competition and because they repudiate the congressional intent that the public interest, convenience and necessity in the ground of licences be determined with reference to the relevant and all the relevant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.885" offset="8367438">As this Court stated in the Miller case in 294 U.S. involving administrative regulation equating the loss of a hand with total disability, the Court said the vice of the regulation therefore, is that it assumes to convert what in the view of the statute is a question of fact requiring proof into a conclusive presumption which dispenses with proof and precludes dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2145.256" offset="8581016">Mr. Connelly's answer to various questions instigated by a question from Mr. Justice Harlan as to the nature of a hearing which would be required on a request for a waiver yesterday points out the basic difference between Storer and the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.713" offset="8666802">Mr. Connelly made it quite clear that the hearing that Storer is asking is a full hearing under Section 309 (b) in every case irrespective of the showing which might be made as to why the otherwise binding rule should not be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.505" offset="8741930">Now, this Section 309 (b) case hearing, is a hearing in which it is required that you have an evidentiary hearing with cross-examination before a hearing examiner with an initial decision or an opportunity to file exceptions and briefs to the Commission and a required oral argument and the final decision of the Commission and an opportunity to file a petition for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.936" offset="8851644">This is not just what is sometimes referred to as due process hearing which varies greatly with the circumstances of the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.922" offset="8899605">Now, we think it clear, that if this type of hearing can be secured upon the mere request by filing an application without setting forth any reasons as to why the rule should not be applied to a particular person, and irrespective of the showing he makes then the rules and any rule which is subject to such a requirement has no binding effect and has no practical value to an agency.</text>
