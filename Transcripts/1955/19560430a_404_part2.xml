            <label>Mr. Orville Entenman</label>
            <text syncTime="4.230" offset="16823">-- please the Court, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.489" offset="33855">In answering the one question, I'll be calling your attention to the Nebraska authority for taxing the leasehold or the interest of Offutt Housing Company in this matter of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.667" offset="90593">I call your attention to the decision by the Nebraska Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.561" offset="118178">It's set out in the record at page 206 quoting from Judge Chappell's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.476" offset="161855">This Court in Ashby versus Peters, a Nebraska case, page 1 -- 206, the last paragraph, held that saved for the purposes of convincing a lease of more than one year is not real estate and also it quotes another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.329" offset="237296">Generally, a leasehold for a term of years is a chattel real falling within the classification of personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.029" offset="272091">For all practical purposes, it maybe equivalent to those absolute ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.406" offset="293616">In that connection, he sets out Section 77-1209 of the revised statutes in Nebraska for 1943, which provide all improvements put on leased public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.368" offset="349414">I might stop right there and say that was particularly up and go in Nebraska on school lands where they had been leased and the improvements did not become the property of the state or the owner of the school land.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.042" offset="416078">It shall be assessed to the owner of such improvements as personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.012" offset="431961">Now, the next phrase â€œtogether with the value of the lease and listed and assessed in a place where the land is situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.369" offset="477414">Now after the -- during the construction of Offutt Housing buildings, they were not complete on the assessment date of March 10th, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.876" offset="507402">They were complete -- not completed and that is the date set out by Nebraska for the ownership for personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.884" offset="559438">Every person corporation must lease a property they own on March 10th of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.007" offset="591935">However, they were completed in June.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.278" offset="605100">The law also requires that each one leased for assessment is property valued.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.276" offset="629029">That was not done except for some furniture and fixtures.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.344" offset="649300">The assessor then later in June assessed this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.132" offset="668526">First, the fixtures and the office equipment in the amount of $205.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.332" offset="701231">The appliances, that was the ranges, the electric stoves or gas stoves, the electric refrigerators, and remember there were 611 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.459" offset="741773">The washing machines and equipment of that type purchased by Offutt Housing and placed here also base on chattel mortgages and conditional sales contracts filed in the county, valued them at $69,695.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.142" offset="812513">Then the buildings, he arrived with his valuation there by determining that they were only 75% completed on the assessment day of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.056" offset="856189">Then basing his valuation from an inspection also from this mortgage of $4,950,000.He determined that the value of that, 75% complete and assessing it in comparison with light, property in the county, residential property, buildings knowing the value of them and what he was putting on them, he valued that in 1955, $755,000, a $5 million project.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.537" offset="998087">I don't think they can complain here that we've taxed any more than Offutt Housing Company's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.341" offset="1025358">And no objection was made to that assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.397" offset="1037584">And of course, the Nebraska law provides that where the taxpayer does not file the schedule and the assessor does it, that he must send notice to the taxpayer and he has a right to come in before the board of equalization, that was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.145" offset="1096516">Then, we've checked the 1953 assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.524" offset="1114070">Those assessments pair in the complete record or the record here at page 144 (a) and 144 (b).I like to comment just a bit on the distinction between the 1953 and the 1952 assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.608" offset="1182407">Nebraska getting to some trouble on their revaluations and making comparison between personal property and real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.804" offset="1215216">And I've point out here, there is no tax on the real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.896" offset="1231517">In this case, there is no attempt to tax any real estate leased in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.805" offset="1267148">But in the personal property field, there were some changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.339" offset="1289300">First, they do to a decision in the Nebraska court which mandamus the -- for the -- or the Tax Commission that lengthens State Tax Commission to value property as its actual value.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.512" offset="1341962">And as a result of that then, you will see in the valuation for 1953, it is now considered 75% or 100% completed, then, all residential property in the state or particularly Sarpy County, partly in Douglas was given a 40% increase on the valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.309" offset="1441228">For here, there were $4000 houses, that is only valued at $800 and $900.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.577" offset="1466305">They got them up 40%.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.731" offset="1474873">In other words, if your assessed value had been a thousand dollars in 1952, in 1953, that would probably been $1400.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.024" offset="1520013">There was a 40% increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.980" offset="1527850">Well at least, they got the same increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.024" offset="1540075">And --</text>

            <text syncTime="401.670" offset="1606635">Well, I really believe, Your Honor, that this Court, that the -- that the determination of the tax, the validity of the tax is the question for the State of Nebraska in the State Court.And they admit it in the jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.300" offset="1665149">I think what this Court has got to be concerned with have we taxed any property of the United States belonging to the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.257" offset="6505012">But the cases, the SRA case and the (Inaudible) case and others where there was a fair legal title in the Government and the full beneficial ownership was in somebody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.581" offset="6738233">Whether this is -- whether this is realty or personally or something like that could depend upon Nebraska law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.088" offset="6760281">Whether this property is owned by the United States or not, whether the lease is controlling, that doesn't depend upon the Nebraska law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.813" offset="6787239">That's federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.450" offset="6789747">That's a question for this Court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.550" offset="6806152">And the Nebraska decision certainly isn't controlling as to whether this property belongs to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.316" offset="6829244">Now, I can't reargue all of what I covered the other day, Your Honor, as -- as to the enclave point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.209" offset="6872816">I would suggest however, that -- that my suggestion there that Congress intended in this statute that government property or rather that the lease property should be treated the same as the lease property next door should be treated, should be taxed no more and not -- and not any less is an accurate reflection of Congressional intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.183" offset="6972709">That would mean that if you were in an enclave entirely private property, it could all be taxed and the lessor or the lessee would make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.172" offset="7004682">If -- if it were an area where the United States did not have exclusive jurisdiction as of the case and many of the reservation in California, and you're in a state where they tax the leasehold interest as California and some other states then you can tax the lessees interest even without the 1947 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.681" offset="7070720">If that was declared in his legislative history, just to be declaratory what the law on those states would be anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.250" offset="7092976">On the other hand, if you're on an exclusive area where the property next door couldn't be taxed if it were privately owned, then we don't think Congress would have intended this kind of project to be taxed by a local government which doesn't furnish any services for it and would thereby be requiring the military tenants to pay double -- to pay taxes for what they weren't benefiting for and to what they actually were paying for in another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.061" offset="7192242">Now I don't think that Section 6 is clear enough if you follow it through how it came in to the statute and everything if its clear enough that, that was intended to apply to an enclave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.428" offset="7237695">To conclude that it was, you have to -- you have to find one that Congress realize they were incorporating Section 6 and not just Section 1 when they wrote the 1949 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.315" offset="7277192">Of course, the other conditions they were referring to were all in Section 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 as I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.582" offset="7298299">They clearly weren't incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.199" offset="7304777">Then you have to assume Congress believed and knew that Section 6 applied to enclaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.695" offset="7326720">And the history of it indicates that the Congressman there couldn't have thought that it did or what they said when they drafted it, Senator Tydings, Secretary Penny, and Secretary Royal didn't make any sense at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.631" offset="7374472">You got to put both of those things together before you can find that it applies -- it applies to an enclave.</text>
