            <label>Mr. Warren Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="26.929" offset="107624">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.827" offset="119223">This case involves the validity of the Federal Commission -- Federal Communication Commission rules which placed a limit on the number of radio or television stations in which any one party may have an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.186" offset="176692">Normally, these are called the Multiple Ownership Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.735" offset="190903">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia decided that the Communications Commission lack the power to adopt such rules because the hearing requirements of Section 309 (b) of the Communications Act prevented the adoption of any rule which would require the rejection without hearing of an application by a citizen for a lawful use of an available frequency.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.506" offset="298005">Now, we sought certiorari in this Court because in our opinion, the principle of law annunciated below would prevent any meaningful utilization of the Commission's rule-making power even where Congress has specifically directed the Commission to deal with specific subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.313" offset="373238">In the first part of my argument, I shall attempt to demonstrate that this broad and newly formulated principle of law, which is found in the decision of the court below, is inconsistent with the Communications Act and not reconcilable with decisions of this Court and in fact the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.207" offset="456725">Secondly, I will attempt to demonstrate that contrary to the reasoning of the court below, the subject of limiting the Multiple Ownership of stations is an appropriate exercise of the rule-making powers of this agency and they are entirely consistent with the basic purposes and objectives of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.270" offset="541048">But before beginning my argument, however, I'd like to give a brief recital of the facts and the history of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.494" offset="577933">Multiple Ownership has always been of concern to the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.986" offset="603847">Since its inception, it has dealt with the question of whether or not it was in the public interest for additional facilities to be made available to parties who already have one or more stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.296" offset="661107">It handled AM or standard radio broadcasting for a long period of time on an ad hoc basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.651" offset="678557">For a long period of time, I say, prior to the adoption of the present rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.091" offset="712307">Nevertheless, it handled the question of Multiple Ownership of FM radio broadcasting stations by a rule since 1940 and television stations by a rule since 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.443" offset="769672">The original rule with respect to television permitted a maximum of three television stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.420" offset="793600">Later, they were amended to five.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.713" offset="802795">This was reaffirmed in the particular rule-making, although since that time, with respect to a certain kind of television station, it has been expanded to seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.527" offset="854100">These rules, which are here before the Court, stem from a notice of proposed rule-making which was issued by the Federal Communications Commission in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.086" offset="904255">This notice of proposed rule-making was to amend existing Multiple Ownership Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.814" offset="939154">It in -- contemplated the inclusion of standard radio broadcasting, AM, within the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.495" offset="973949">It considered the question of different treatment for minority interest and because of various counter proposals there was also, involved in the rule-making, questions as to making the number dependent upon area, geographic area of power or coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.699" offset="1046779">There were also alternative proposals to raise the limit in FM from six to seven and in television from five to seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.567" offset="1090247">After receiving comments and hearing oral argument, the Commission issued a decision and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.704" offset="1122743">In substance, that decision brought for the first time standard radio broadcasting within the limits of the rule rather than on an ad hoc basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.371" offset="1165479">It raised the limit with respect to FM broadcasting from six to seven and it refused to adopt other alternatives among which were different limits for minority interest, different limits for area and power and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.939" offset="1235696">And it also refused to raise the limit in television from five to seven, but it reserved one specific portion of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.752" offset="1270909">And that related to the question of making a different maximum where UHF television was concerned rather than VHF.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.959" offset="1307794">After an appeal in this case, the Commission actually raised the limit to seven providing a maximum of five VHF were permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.234" offset="1352934">Therefore, it does not affect this case because when this decision and order was issued, Storer, the respondent here, was already the owner of five VHF television stations and was applying for a six VHF television station.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.125" offset="1436421">That -- that application, being inconsistent with the rule, was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.796" offset="1459096">Now, I'd like to point out that in the decision of the Commission adopting these rules in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act, they specifically set forth the basis and purpose of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.538" offset="1518132">Yes, they did more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.780" offset="1527118">They discussed extensively all of the alternative proposals and set forth their reasons for either adopting or rejecting those alternative proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.550" offset="1570168">Now, with respect to the purpose of the rules, the Commission said as follows and this is found on page 21 of the record, "The fundamental purpose of the Multiple Ownership Rules is to promote diversification of program and service viewpoints as well as to prevent any undue concentration of economic power contrary to the public interest."</text>
            <text syncTime="416.027" offset="1664104">The Commission further stated that it is our view that the operation of broadcast stations by a large group of diversified licensees will better serve the public interest than the operation of broadcasting stations by a small and limited group of licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.946" offset="1743726">Now, as I said because an application of respondent was dismissed as inconsistent with the rule, respondent filed an appeal in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.187" offset="1784686">It filed its appeal, however, from the specific rules themselves under Section 402 (a) of the Communications Act and the Judicial Review Act of 1950, in fact, alleging also violation of the Administrative Procedures Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.668" offset="1846648">The Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia found that the limitations on Multiple Ownership were invalid because in its view, the rules, however laudable their purpose, conflict with Section 309 (b) of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.098" offset="1908297">Therefore, it is affirmed that any discussion of the decision of the Court of Appeals must be preceded by an examination of certain other provisions of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.715" offset="1958766">Now, in Title 3 of the Communications Act, Sections 301 through 319 deal primarily with the licensing functions of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.976" offset="2003801">Section 309 (b), the particular section which the court below rested its decision, provides in substance that where the Commission is unable to make -- to make a finding that it is in the public interest to grant an application without a hearing, it shall so notify the applicant and after an opportunity to reply if it is still unable to make it, it will set the matter for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.103" offset="2112366">On the other hand, other provisions of the Communications Act deal with rule-making power of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.503" offset="2141936">Specifically, Section 4 (i), 303 (f), and 303 (r) authorize the Commission to adopt rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.229" offset="2196898">Thus, the court below was dealing with the scope of the rule-making power.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.150" offset="2224588">The scope of the rule-making power granted to the Communications Commission to set forth policies and standards of general applicability and the scope of the hearing requirements on a particular application.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.137" offset="2276519">A purely literal reading of Section 309 (b) would of course to stop the Federal Communication Commission from adopting any binding rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.865" offset="2315389">The court below, however, aware of numerous decisions upholding the Commission's power to adopt rules, stated they were a few exceptions and it stated the very few, three in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.682" offset="2370664">First, it said because Congress itself had required that only citizens maybe licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.364" offset="2393443">An application of an alien need not be given a hearing unless, of course, there is a factual dispute as to whether someone is or is not a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.319" offset="2429179">Similarly, largely based on this Court's decision in the lottery rules, A.B.C. versus U.S. which is sighted in our brief, the Court held that the Commission did not need to give a hearing when the application was for an unlawful use.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.151" offset="2492604">It also stated that the Commission did not have to give a hearing when the frequency applied for by an applicant was unavailable because the Commission had adopted rules which placed it in allocation table so it was not available in the community for which it was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.861" offset="2559373">Specifically, the Court of Appeals stated it's formulation of the law in reference to Section 309 (b) of the Act as follows and this is found in the record on page 50, "The statutory provision means that any citizen who seeks a license for the lawful use of an available frequency as the undoubted right to a hearing before his application maybe rejected."</text>
            <text syncTime="665.549" offset="2662191">Now, respondent did not choose to defend the Court's statement of the law, instead respondents formulates a different one.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.216" offset="2696777">Respondent says that Section 309 (b) requires a hearing on an application whenever Congress itself has not so defined the public interest as to preclude the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.159" offset="2744633">We think both of these formulations are incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.465" offset="2757799">But certainly under either statement of the law, the Commission's rule-making power is rendered largely meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.761" offset="2794998">We believe rather that the rule-making power extends generally to the establishment of criteria for the exercise of the licensing function committed by Congress to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.646" offset="2842540">Subject of course to the condition that the particular exercise of the rule-making function be consistent with the standards and objectives of the Communications Act and that the Commission is not required by Section 309 (b) to reopen on a case to case basis the policy judgments which are embodied in the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.956" offset="2927804">We think the Commission may establish by appropriate rules the standards it will apply in passing on applications for broadcast licenses and limit the hearing to determining whether those standards are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.228" offset="2976810">In this case, even respondents admit that if the rules themselves are valid, there is no necessity for a factual hearing to determine whether or not they comply with the standards because there is no question to what the application itself showed that they have the maximum the rule specifically permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.448" offset="3053714">We think that the Court of Appeals, therefore, misinterpreted the import of the decisions which sustained the Commission's exercise of its rule-making power and the present decision is just not reconcilable to those previous decisions both in this Court and in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.100" offset="3124349">Now, the leading case on the rule-making power as the F.C.C. is one with respect to the chain broadcasting regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.086" offset="3164264">This is N.B.C. versus U.S. found in 319 U.S. on page 190.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.401" offset="3189551">It's not without significance but although this case was argued extensively and briefed by both sides in the court below, the Court does not even refer to its meaning in reaching its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.885" offset="3243468">In the N.B.C. case, this Commission sustained rules of the Federal Communications Commission which are similar in form to the Multiple Ownership Rules, since they state that no license will be issued in certain conditions under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.642" offset="3314521">There as here in the case before the Court, there were allegations that the Federal Communication Commission had exceeded its rule-making power.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.079" offset="3352242">There as here, the Commission set forth criteria and factors deemed to be contrary to the public interest which warranted in and of themselves a denial of a license or renewal of a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.836" offset="3403337">There as here, the standards did not involve unlawful uses or unavailability of frequencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.338" offset="3437296">The standards instead, as this Court said, were the Commission's particularization of its conception of the public interest and the basic purpose was to encourage a larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="892.163" offset="3568640">Certain aspects of the Chain Broadcasting Rules are almost identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.799" offset="3591105">For example, in the Chain Broadcasting Rules, there is one provision which says that the Commission will deem it is contrary to the public interest for a network to own two stations in a single community or serving substantially the same area.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.462" offset="3653799">That happens to be the first section of the Multiple Ownership Rules which relate to people other than the networks.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.291" offset="3681071">That perhaps is the reason that that particular section was not appealed by respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.160" offset="3700611">But it, in a sense, is the same, is a mathematical limitation on the number of stations in which a party may have an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.920" offset="3731644">It happens to be confined to a community rather than the entire United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="951.927" offset="3807608">Under the Chain Broadcasting Rules since some of the particular rules were more comprehensive and involves such matters as indirect or by any means certain relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.927" offset="3851703">A great portion of the time, there would be factual matters which needed to be disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.605" offset="3870407">But this Court in its original decision with respect to the Chain Broadcasting Rules specifically stated that these were not matters which would be raised and were subject to determination in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.280" offset="3921084">They were matters which if there was to be a hearing, the hearing would be on whether or not they complied with the rules, not on the policy judgments which justified the rules.</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="1713.388" offset="6853486">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.603" offset="6854322">It was affirmed in this case on a per curiam decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.251" offset="6868950">These rules provided that no license would be granted or renewed where a transferor had reserved the right to -- to reassignment in the license or had reserved the right to use a certain -- retain certain amount of time in the use of the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.359" offset="6945332">The Commission's rules provided that it would not grant a renewal or it would not grant a license to someone who had entered into such a contract where this was reserved to the original transferor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.291" offset="6989113">Those rules were sustained where there was an allegation that this was beyond the power of the Commission by a three-judge statutory court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.016" offset="7027984">And it was appealed as a matter of right to this Court and this Court affirmed those on a per curiam decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.615" offset="7050449">An examination of the briefs to this Court in that case will show that the question of exceeding the power, the rule-making power of the Commission was directly an issue and this Court sustained the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.534" offset="7102067">Now, respondent suggested that in Felman, it was merely a codification of what Section 301 required, control in the licensee rather than someone other than the licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.250" offset="7152953">This was not a mere codification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.429" offset="7165701">It was a new policy implementing congressional objectives which prior to this time the F.C.C. had permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.775" offset="7199033">Prior to this time the Commission had permitted that degree of retention and control and it concluded this was inconsistent with the public interest and laid down the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.474" offset="7233829">There is another rule and this was not in this Court but in the court below, the Logansport case which deals with the question of the Commission's power by rule-making to handle the questions of fair and equitable distribution of facilities amongst the various states and communities which is one of the specific provisions of the Act referred to under public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.962" offset="7331840">We see no rational difference between our right to say that there will only be the following frequencies in this community and anyone who files an application for a frequency, which is not in our rules in this community, is not permitted the opportunity to -- by a hearing, establish that we should put one there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.153" offset="7416581">That was what those rules do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.252" offset="7424940">Those were an exercise of our rule-making power which the court below found were sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.635" offset="7454511">Turning once more to the respondent's formulation of the law, that is that Section 309 (b) requires a hearing unless Congress itself has so defined the public interest so as to preclude the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.937" offset="7503726">Respondent supports the Logansport decision as a rule prohibiting the licensing of an applicant who proposes to disrupt “the equitable distribution of radio facilities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.431" offset="7549701">Congress did not preclude a grant contrary to the specific rules anymore than in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.275" offset="7577078">Those rules were merely the Commission's interpretation of fair and equitable distribution of facilities as part of what Congress specified as public interest just as the present rules are the Commission's specification and particularization of the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.920" offset="7647608">We think that the doctrine of the Chenery case in this Court specifically permits the Commission in its discretion to determine whether or not to make this policy-making determination, this quasi legislative determination by rule-making rather than on an ad hoc basis if the Commission so desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.054" offset="7736216">In summary, we believe that the real import of the Court decisions is that where the Commission has adopted a reasonable rule properly related to considerations of public interest, the requirements of Section of 309 (b) are met by a hearing more appropriate on the question of compliance with the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.810" offset="7811239">There was no question here of the ability to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.857" offset="7827331">I would like to go on and discuss the second part of my argument as to the reasonableness of this particular subject matter of these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.733" offset="7870903">The basic purpose, as stated by the Commission, was to promote the diversification of ownership in order to maximize the diversification of program and service viewpoints as well as to prevent any undue concentration of economic power contrary to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.693" offset="7946762">In expressing that view, it came to the conclusion that it was better to have a large diversified group of licensees than to permit these limited facilities to gradually come into the hands of a small group of licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.288" offset="8013113">Now, there's no question to what an important aspect of public interest to be served by the Commission is the maintenance of the field of broadcasting as one of free and extensive competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.154" offset="8056581">The Sanders case, cited in our brief, establishes that and we think here that the Commission was concerned with preserving the full measure of competition, competition between program and service viewpoints and competitions in an economic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.258" offset="8125022">The concentration of station ownership in the hands of a relatively small number of licensees would, like the network abuses in which the Chain Broadcasting Rules were designed to eliminate, prevent the maximum utilization of radio facilities in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.688" offset="8186671">This is a specific chart found in Section 303 (g), generally to encourage the larger and more effective use of radio in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.243" offset="8232960">And we think there is no question for what, as one factor in public interest, the diversification of program and service viewpoints has been held many times to be legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.531" offset="8278100">It is a matter which is again and again applied in comparative cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.175" offset="8304640">As this Court has stated in Associated Press versus United States in 326 U.S., page 1 and I'm quoting from page 20 of that decision, “The widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the general welfare of the public.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.134" offset="8384470">We think that is essentially what the Commission means in attempting to maintain as great a diversification of program and service viewpoints as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.378" offset="8425430">We also think the other aspect, the other objective which it seeks to obtain through this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.218" offset="8448836">The prevention of undue concentration of economic power has been sustained in many cases, particularly the N.B.C. case and the Mansfield Journal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.890" offset="8487497">And we cite this merely to show that this is a factor in public interest which the Commission maybe concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.939" offset="8519680">The Multiple Ownership Rules do serve this related purpose of effectuating a congressional policy against an undue concentration of economic power in the hands of a few individual members of the broadcast industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.544" offset="8574119">For the owner of numerous stations is in a position to utilize the enhanced bargaining power conferred by Multiple Ownership Rules in such ways as obtaining network affiliations over weaker competitors and other matters in this competitive struggle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.181" offset="8640679">Advantages, mind you, which flow not from quality of service and program but from the pure concentration of economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.820" offset="8679236">Respondent suggest that we cannot prevent this concentration without establishing that in each particular instance, there has been a violation of the antirust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.109" offset="8716434">We submit that has been decided in the Mansfield Journal case that the Commission may take into account practices which in its opinion will be violative of those underlying policies which led to the adoption of the antitrust laws particularly in this field of limited facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.362" offset="8797414">This -- these rules are not mere restatements of antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.402" offset="8817580">In the National Broadcasting case, the regulations were not there rested on the conclusion that various practice to which they pertain could be regarded as per se violations of the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.898" offset="8863556">The practice in question were prescribed not because they were found unlawful but because they were deemed, like here, to prevent the maximum utilization of radio facilities in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.898" offset="8915592">We think the rules and their objectives are imminently reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.801" offset="8931161">Both objectives as set forth by the Commission are consistent with the Communications Act and whether these objectives are to be handled by an ad hoc determination, they are policy determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.900" offset="8971598">They're not matters relating to a particular case to the particular evils of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.168" offset="9000647">These objectives are general objectives and if they're handled on an ad hoc basis even the considerations still would be, what is the appropriate limitation for a general standard for the evils to be prevented?</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.608" offset="9054354">The wider diversifications of interest are not matters relating to a particular case, they are objectives for the entire United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.982" offset="9091866">Now, how can you handle this matter except on an individual basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.887" offset="9107540">Basically, each time that an additional station comes under the control or influence of any one person, these two objectives are thereby to a degree conflicted with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.685" offset="9150694">The second station in which a party has an interest diminishes the diversification of persons in broadcasting and it increases the dangers of competitive advantage from economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.942" offset="9199700">The third does more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.450" offset="9205760">The fourth does more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.316" offset="9213179">At some place, the Commission should be entitled to draw a line and we think that the only equitable way to treat the problem is to draw a line through rule-making where all of the parties have an opportunity to comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.585" offset="9270335">For if these lines are to be drawn in individual cases, only the particular person concerned will comment and have an opportunity to say what should be the particular line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.400" offset="9317564">The exercise of the rule-making power in this particular case in this kind of situation is exactly what rule-making is for, to establish standards which apply for broad purposes across the board rather than try on an ad hoc basis to reach those conclusions which in any case would be the same kind of policy determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.921" offset="9399589">We think that the Commission's experience and the record of the industry furnish a convincing basis for the agency's conclusion that there are enough different persons in the United States capable and desirous of serving the needs of the public so that the extremes of Multiple Ownership may be avoided without adversely affecting the public interest in securing qualified licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.781" offset="9491122">If as weird, the Commission may impose some limitation on the Multiple Ownership of broadcasting stations, it seems plain that the selection of a particular sealing is a matter for the Commission's informed and expert judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.643" offset="9550472">We think therefore that this Court should reject the formulation of law set forth in the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.859" offset="9575340">We think that it basically is unsound and we think that the -- this Court should there also find that the Commission's rules are inappropriate and reasonable exercise of Commission's power in this particular subject which is completely consistent with the objectives which the Commission has been charged with carrying out by Congress in the Communications Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2546.000" offset="10183993">If that were true, wage and hour, maximums for children, speed laws and the like would also be invalid because certainly they do not fit the particular case with respect to all the variable factors which anyone can dream up.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>

            <label>Mr. Albert R. Connelly</label>
            <text syncTime="2572.858" offset="10291409">Your Honors, the Commission's argument in this case depends very largely upon it's assertion that it has been entrusted with the Congress with broad, expansive and substantive rule-making powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.880" offset="10355461">Almost as if to say that the Commission is authorized to adopt a rule on any matter affecting communications on which the Congress could itself have legislated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.981" offset="10407915">That argument completely overlooked the fact that the rule-making power is purely incidental to the substantive provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.581" offset="10454309">Each of the sections of the Act which confers rule-making power, and they are set forth at page 5 of the respondent's brief, is itself strictly limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.070" offset="10512196">It authorizes the adoption of a rule which first must be not inconsistent with the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.845" offset="10563291">And second, which must be necessary, mind you not necessary or desirable, necessary to prevent interference between stations or otherwise to carry out the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.415" offset="10625567">And the question therefore here is whether these numerical prescription rules are consistent with the Act and whether they are necessary to carry out its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.719" offset="10678857">Now, Section 309 (b) which is the Section dealing with applications for license, provides that if the Commission is unable to find without a hearing that the grant of a license would serve the public interest, then it shall formally designate the application for hearing on the grounds or reasons then obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.244" offset="10768927">That, I submit to Your Honors, is a very vital section of the Act because it is only the physical limitation on the available facilities which provides any justification for impairing the otherwise equal rights of citizens to access to means of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.863" offset="10859416">And this Court has held in the Ashbacker case, the hearing contemplated by 309 (b) is not a matter of discretion, it's a matter of right and this Court has also held that a denial of a statutory right, the hearing is a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.058" offset="10928170">Now, what do these rules here do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.577" offset="10942276">Those rules deny a hearing under 309 (b) to anyone holding interests in five TV stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.604" offset="10986371">There isn't any question about the interpretation of that phrase because it has been interpreted by the Commission, as Mr. Baker has pointed out, in the application filed by Storer and indeed in others where applications by persons owning five TV stations are automatically dismissed without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.527" offset="11062021">Accordingly, on their face, these rules are inconsistent with Section 309 (b) and there is no showing whatever that they are necessary to carry out any other provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.649" offset="11122521">We conceded in the court below and concede here that that statutory right to hearing is subject to an implied qualification but only where the Congress itself has declared or determined the public interest so as to preclude the possibility of a grant of a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.641" offset="11206531">For example, in the case of an application by an alien, they don't have to have a hearing to determine whether a grant to an alien is in the public interest because Section 310 of the Act says it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.955" offset="11259820">Similarly, an application in conflict with the nationwide allocation of frequency because the Commission is required by another section of the Act, 307 (b), "The substitute for the test through the public interest in the individual application, the test of fair, efficient and equitable distribution of frequencies among the several states and communities."</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.395" offset="11369535">And that was the situation which the court below dealt with in the Logansport case referred to by Mr. Baker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.704" offset="11398792">Similarly, an application by a person on the contract to transfer control of the station to a non-licensee in violation of Section 301 of the Act, that was the situation involved in the Felman case here or an application by someone who proposes to conduct a lottery in violation of the Federal Criminal Code, the situation that Your Honors dealt with in the American Broadcasting case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.825" offset="11507252">In other words, where a federal statute has determined the public interest, a hearing is not required because the statute bars the finding, prerequisite to the issuance of a license that it would be in the public interest to grant it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.664" offset="12194586">You said there that the public interest, convenience or necessity standard for the issuance of licenses would seem to imply a requirement that the applicant be law abiding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.090" offset="12240353">In that case referring to the lottery that the applicant there propose to conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.565" offset="12258220">Now, there isn't any such case here, although the Commission has sought to justify these rules on the basis of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.178" offset="12292702">It concedes that the acquisition of the ownership, which is proscribed by these rules, is not in violation of the antitrust laws or indeed of any other laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.726" offset="12342857">And our position is that where the Congress has not itself determine the public interest factor then the Commission must determine on the basis of all 11 factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.162" offset="12384549">I'd like to make it quite clear in view of what Mr. Baker stated that there isn't any question here of the Commission's power to consider Multiple Ownership as a factor nor indeed is there any question of its power to adopt policy declarations with reference to Multiple Ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.108" offset="12464379">Indeed, they have done just that in provisions of these Multiple Ownership Rules which are not here under attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.786" offset="12499069">And at page 29 of the record, this TV rule appears in the second subdivision, provision that no license shall be granted if the grant of such license would result in a concentration of control of television broadcasting in a manner inconsistent with public interest convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.312" offset="12581198">There can be no objection to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.762" offset="12591020">In the second sentence, this I do ask Your Honors' particular attention to that these deals with the situation prior to the point at which the magic number has been reached to five.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.473" offset="12645878">In determining whether there is such a concentration of control, consideration will be given to the facts of each case with particular reference to such factors as the size, extent and location of areas served, the number of people served and the extent of other competitive service to the areas to areas in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.594" offset="12738351">Those are perfectly proper declarations of policy on the part of the Commission, but the Commission cannot, as it has here, ignore its statutory duty to grant a hearing on all relevant factors and not merely the matter of Multiple Ownership to determine public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.767" offset="12815047">The court below stated, as Mr. Baker has already noted, the statutory provision, that is to say 309 (b), means that any citizen who seeks a license for the lawful use of an available frequency as the undoubted right to a hearing before his application may be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.350" offset="12897384">And the Commission suggests that our position here in some respects or in some manner differs from that statement of the law by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.718" offset="12942838">I submit that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.601" offset="12954331">The court below was merely particularizing the general principle since Congress has determined the public interest with reference to a license to an area, has determined the public interest with reference to other unlawful use, has determined the procedure for determining nationwide allocation of frequencies whether there are other matters that may come within the general principle is not here for consideration, those are the only factors which have been suggested up to this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.438" offset="13085675">The Commission's apparent reliance on the Chain Broadcasting Regulations and the cases thereunder, I find very difficult to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.320" offset="13133218">In the order, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter recalled in the order adopting those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.418" offset="13161639">Initially, the Commission stated, the quotation is at page 17 of our brief, “The applicant's right to a hearing on the question whether he does in fact propose to operate in the public interest is fully preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.202" offset="13224751">The regulations we are adopting are nothing more than the expression of the general policy we will follow in exercising our licensing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.023" offset="13260069">The formulation of a regulation in general terms is an important aid to consistency and predictability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.978" offset="13295909">It does not prejudice any rights of the applicant."</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.758" offset="13306984">I think that may be contrasted with the statement Your Honors have just heard that if a hearing is required through regulations or the power to make rules is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.207" offset="13348780">Now, in that situation in the Columbia Broadcasting System case, 316 U.S., the Commission opposed judicial review of those regulations because they said they -- that they were only announcements of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.928" offset="13419624">This Court granted review not on the ground that the regulations denied a hearing, but that the right to appeal from a denial of an application after a hearing was not an adequate remedy to test the problems created by those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.718" offset="13494857">There wasn't any question raised by any party for that proceeding as to the applicants right to a hearing under 309 (b), as stated in the dissenting opinion in support of the Commission's position that Mr. Justice Frankfurter noted that the statute provide an administrative procedure under which the Commission must make a specific determination in each case whether the public interest would be served by granting the particular application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.579" offset="13602273">And after this Court had granted that review in the C.B.S. case and the Chain Broadcasting Regulations came before you in the N.B.C. case, the Commission submitted in its brief in that case which is quoted at page 18 of our brief said, “In the language of 309 (b), each applicant, unless his application is granted without a hearing, is entitled to a hearing," now, I mind you, "not only that he may have an opportunity to show that he is entitled to a grant of an application under the established policies of the Commission, but also that he may show if necessary that such policies are not appropriate in his particular situation."</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.894" offset="13803520">And it was against that background that this Court announced in the N.B.C. case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.547" offset="13834136">The Commission did not bind itself inflexibly to the licensing policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.984" offset="13851899">In each case that comes before it, the Commission must still exercise an ultimate judgment whether the grant of that license would serve the public interest convenience or necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.090" offset="13896307">A very similar conclusion was reached by the court below in the Stahlman case, a case involving a subpoena issued in a newspaper investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.094" offset="13944372">The Court there said if in this case it had been made to appear as counsel for the Commission -- the counsel for appellant insists that the Commission's investigation was solely for the purpose and the consideration or adoption of a hard or fast rule as the result of which newspaper owners may be placed in a proscribed class and thereby made ineligible to receive or apply -- apply or receive a license, we should be obliged to declare that such an investigation would be wholly outside of and beyond any of the powers with which Congress has clothed the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.389" offset="14097554">The numerical prescription rules here in question place the owners at interests in specified numbers of stations in a proscribed class and make them ineligible to receive licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.133" offset="14160457">Under the Commission's position in this case, I submit to Your Honors, the Commission could equally adopt rules precluding licenses to newspaper owners without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.225" offset="14220852">Because certainly, the ownership of other mass media of communication is at least as much related to the avowed purposes of these rules as is the ownership of other television stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.100" offset="14284382">We submit that the court below correctly held that there was no such power conferred upon the Commission to do that in the absence of a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.440" offset="14329731">The numerical prescription rules here in question are invalid not only because they denied a hearing under 309 (b) but because they are arbitrary, in that, they exclude required consideration of relevant facts and in that, their basis is not adequately disclosed.</text>
