            <text syncTime="51.844" offset="207308">In this case, the defendant, Affronti, was indicted in 1932 by a grand jury in the Western District of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.810" offset="243148">Charged in an indictment in ten counts with the illegal sale of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.083" offset="268330">I've mentioned the dates because they, if not of importance, will be of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.584" offset="290273">In 1944, the defendant was brought in to the District Court at Kansas City on a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum from the Missouri State Penitentiary where he was in the service of a sentence for second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.839" offset="359340">The District Judge on that -- at that time was Judge Caskie Collet.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.873" offset="383478">Upon trial before a jury, the defendant was acquitted on the first of the ten counts, found guilty on the remaining nine and sentence was pronounced disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.956" offset="439798">On all nine counts of the -- the indictment, he was sentenced to serve five years which was the maximum sentence under the statute that had been violated.Sentences two, three, four and five were pronounced to run consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.326" offset="513254">The remaining five sentences, sentence was suspended and the defendant was to be placed upon probation for a period of 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.142" offset="560483">The judgment further provided that the sentence on the second count would be to commence at the time he was released from authorities in Missouri State.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.125" offset="616490">In 1949, after his release from the Missouri State Penitentiary, he was delivered to the United States Marshal for the service of the first five years of the second count of the indictment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry F. Murphy</label>
            <text syncTime="177.844" offset="711367">Twenty years, four -- four counts of five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.613" offset="734354">But the computation is a question whether he had yet started the service as -- as second of his third five years, but in 1943, at which time Judge Duncan had succeeded Judge Collet as the District Judge in that division, Judge Collet having been promoted to the Eighth Circuit bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.060" offset="816170">A motion was filed on his behalf requesting that the remaining sentences yet to be served, either the third, fourth, and fifth counts or the fourth and fifth, that the execution of the sentence as yet to be served be suspended and be placed on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.112" offset="900389">Now, in -- two months prior to the filing of the motion on behalf of the petitioner in the District Court, Judge Reeves, another division of the Western District had ruled in the case of Phillips versus the United States for the facts as far as sentences are concerned, were identical with the facts in this case, and that Phillips, the defendant, was in the service of the first of three consecutive terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.196" offset="1012715">That the Court was without jurisdiction to entertain such a motion as the term had passed and the 60 days had -- had passed when he had -- after he had been first sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.426" offset="1073633">Pending the appeal of the Phillips case, Judge Duncan held in abeyance of ruling on the Affronti case.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.334" offset="1117309">On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the Phillips decision was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.505" offset="1153985">On that bench, sitting as a member of the Court of Appeals, was Judge Collet.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.813" offset="1175197">And in a dissenting opinion, he held that a District Court in his opinion had a right to retain jurisdiction over sentences yet to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.465" offset="1229845">After the Phillips case was passed, the time had passed, no application was made to this Court for certiorari, although the Court of Appeals had recommended that he'd be permitted to apply without the payment of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.261" offset="1292957">The Court -- appeal was taken in the Affronti case to the same court.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.140" offset="1312496">And again, on that same court, Judge Collet sat as a member of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.148" offset="1336529">Following the Phillips case, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Phillips case.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.852" offset="1363383">Judge Collet consistently again dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.534" offset="1378116">Again, that Court recommended that Affronti be permitted to apply for certiorari without the payment of costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.430" offset="1421688">The basis of the ruling in the Phillips case, opinion by Judge Reeves, the District Judge and followed up by the Court of Appeals, was an early case passed on this Court in 1948 by the opinion written by Chief Justice Taft, Murray versus the United States, in which the facts briefly were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.800" offset="1527118">A man by the name of Cook had been sentenced in a Texas District Court for a total of 14 years and some months.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.906" offset="1563585">A man in Nebraska had been sentenced to three months on six counts to run concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.429" offset="1601620">After the defendant Murray had served one day of his three-month sentence, the sentencing judge made an order suspending the execution of that sentence and placed Murray on probation for the balance of his term.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.383" offset="1669433">Shortly thereafter in Texas, the District Court in the Cook case, after the service of sentence had been began by Cook for several years at least, on the one sentence according to the opinion, the Court in that case ordered the defendant placed on probation, suspended the execution of the remaining sentence then being served.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.457" offset="1769744">Upon appeal by the Government to this Court, certiorari from the Eighth Circuit and the Fifth, I believe it was, the opinion held that having once -- once started the service of the sentence, the District Court was without power to place the defendant on probation suspend the execution of that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.103" offset="1876323">In that case, there was no question of consecutive sentences, although perhaps, in the Cook case, the sentence actually was of sentences running consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.852" offset="1919373">But that doesn't appear to have been of any moment at least to the Court in the Murray opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.248" offset="1952914">That created, if not confusion, at least some difference of opinions in the different circuits as to the right of the sentencing judge under the Probation Act to sentence and suspend at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.031" offset="2016026">Some courts holding that having sentenced on one count, the court could not, on remaining counts, place the -- the defendant on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.432" offset="2069629">That had been followed or there was some confusion in the various circuits or the districts, shall we say, until the Kirk case went up to the Ninth Circuit from California.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.051" offset="2124173">In that case, three defendants had been sentenced on consecutive terms, the first two of which were seventeen and a half years and the third for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.168" offset="2164611">During the service of the first sentence by one of the defendants, the court in that case ordered the execution, suspend the remaining sentences, and at the completion of the service of that first sentence, the defendant was to be placed on probation.</text>

            <label>Mr. John V. Lindsay</label>
            <text syncTime="924.567" offset="3698207">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.354" offset="3709388">When this Court decided the (Inaudible) case in 1916, which I believe is the case that Mr. Justice Frankfurter was referring to in Volume 242, it made two points clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.942" offset="3755677">First of all, that there was no power that common law -- to suspend a sentence absolutely or permanently.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.437" offset="3785665">It did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.978" offset="3791830">And secondly, that the federal courts had no such power, despite the fact at which existed in some federal and in some state courts at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.478" offset="3833835">"Recourse must be had to the Congress," said this Court, whose power in this field in the language of the Court is adequately complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.521" offset="3869989">The result of the (Inaudible) case was continued and reinforced agitation on the part of the exponents of probation were some sort of legislation in this field, and it resulted in 1925 in the passage of the Probation Act of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.026" offset="3936026">And that Act provided that after conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the Court, District Court, may suspend sentence and grant probation that the Court may suspend at the imposition or the execution of sentence and grant probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.912" offset="4015647">And of course that statute, spoken terms of a general or single sentence, there was no differentiation made in the case of a sentence involving multiple counts or indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.898" offset="4067579">The chief difficulty that the federal courts had with the application of that statute was the question which was answered by this Court in Murray in volume 275, 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.279" offset="4117107">There are other subsidiary difficulties which the federal courts had but they're not of immediate concern to this problem today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.798" offset="4147096">And if Murray case held -- this Court there held that the District Court loses power to suspend sentence once the defendant has entered upon the service of his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.753" offset="4190981">And in the language of this Court, it was stated that when any part of the sentence has been served, the District Court loses power to entertain a motion to put it to suspend sentence and grant probation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1064.243" offset="4256914">It was not, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.056" offset="4264124">The Murray case had came up -- it was two cases as counsel has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.444" offset="4281678">One concerned a -- a sentence for 14 years and 9 months and the application for probation was presented to the District Court four years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.576" offset="4326296">It actually was a case involving consecutive terms, but it was not argued, presented, or decided by this Court on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.021" offset="4360046">The Cook case incidentally, which was the companion case decided by the Court at the same time, involved a sentence for three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.083" offset="4388258">And one day after the incarceration, the prisoner came to the Court and asked to have his sentence suspended and probation granted and the Court, as counsel has pointed out, granted the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.061" offset="4440189">But the basis for the holding of the Court in the Murray case, which again was concerned with the 1925 statute prior to the 1948 revision of the Criminal Code is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.734" offset="4498913">Three points stand out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.802" offset="4507167">"One," said to this Court, “The reason for the Probation Act was this, was to grant to young and new first violators of the law a chance to reform and to avoid the contaminating influence of association with hardened criminals at the time of the sentence."</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.305" offset="4581146">Avoidance at the time of the sentence was the key that was expounded to the Congress by the proponents of the legislation at the time it was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.143" offset="4620539">And indeed, that was the background against which the legislation was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.700" offset="4638720">"Secondly," said this Court, “Congress could not have intended in passing this legislation to require the District Court, days, months, indeed years later to entertain applications for suspension of sentence and probation after the prisoner has been turned over to the Attorney General for custody and has commenced his -- his service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.876" offset="4723461">Thirdly, Congress and this is related to point number 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.541" offset="4738090">"Thirdly," said the Court in the Murray Case, “Congress could not have intended an overlap with the resulting conflicts that would occur between the operation of the probation of the parole statute which even then provided for parole after one-third of the aggregate sentence and the application of the good time statutes -- the credit for good conduct, which is given to prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.846" offset="4835370">On the one hand, and indeed of course, the power of clemency which is always available, the presidential power of clemency, those on the one hand and the judiciary on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.070" offset="4884271">Now, the Government submits that the reason and logic set forth by this Court in the Murray case is equally -- applies with equal force and vigor under the 1948 revision to the Probation Act of the code of -- and indeed to the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.601" offset="4962325">Well, the 1948 revision did only two things to the 1925 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.036" offset="4988134">First, it changed the initial language that after conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the District Court may suspend sentence and grant a probation, it changed that to read upon entering judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.017" offset="5048007">Now, the Reviser's Notes do not indicate that there was any substantive change intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.999" offset="5075905">The Reviser's Notes only indicate this, that the change in language was made because the excess language was dropped as unnecessary, said the revisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.992" offset="5111954">Now, it is submitted that in the absence of substantive change, that the Reviser's and the Congress must have known the construction that have been placed upon the Probation Act by this Court in the Murray case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.539" offset="5158139">And indeed, if anything, the use of the word upon indicates a more stringent application of the use of probation than had been prior to -- than have been the case before this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.182" offset="5236715">Now, the second change that was made in the -- by the Revisers were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.600" offset="5258344">That an additional sentence was inserted which ran as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.600" offset="5274331">That probation may be limited to one or -- or more counts or indictments but that in the absence of a specific limitation, it shall extend to the entire sentence, singular, and judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.938" offset="5351654">Now, the Reviser's Notes indicate, in that respect only this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.868" offset="5367432">That that change or addition reflected the existing practice in the federal courts which was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.201" offset="5396793">This Court, in two decisions in volumes 302 and 303 had approved the practice of -- at the time of judgment, at the time of sentencing, of sentencing, of sending a man to jail on some counts and granting probation -- suspending sentence and granting probation on other counts and the same with respect to multiple indictments tried together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.724" offset="5494805">So those two questions were settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.094" offset="5504313">And what the Reviser's Notes indicated was correct that existing practice was being confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.040" offset="5536078">Now, Judge Sanborn in the Phillips case -- the Phillips case and the Affronti case and instant case come up from the Eighth Circuit in which the Government argues is the correct rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.206" offset="5592816">And I should add too that the Eighth Circuit is supported by the very articulate opinion of Judge Dobie in the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.915" offset="5631582">Judges Parker and Soper going along with him which in turn is based in large part on the excellent opinion of Judge Chestnut in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.175" offset="5668676">Those two Circuits argue this way in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.467" offset="5693858">That the Probation Act is not an isolated act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.928" offset="5711621">That at the time of the revision of the code, the Revisers intended a comprehensive and orderly revision of all of the statutes relating to crime and criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.828" offset="5755298">And then it could not have been the intent of the Congress at that time to upset the construction that have been placed on the 1925 Act by this code which clearly enunciated the desirability of having a division between the Judicial Branch of the Government and the Executive Branch of the Government when it comes to the business of modification or reorganizing a sentence of a man who is in the custody of the Attorney General.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.520" offset="9514005">For these reasons, I respectfully submit that the decision and judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2395.337" offset="9581296">I think the decision of this Court will go a long ways towards turning up a misunderstanding that exist throughout the country because we have District Courts and unreported cases which we know about or not daily but frequently suspending the execution of sentences yet to be served where the defendants is confined.</text>
