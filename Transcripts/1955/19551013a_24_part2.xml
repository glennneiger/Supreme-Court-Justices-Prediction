          <heading>Argument of Morton H. Hollander</heading>
          <turn speaker="morton_h_hollander" startTime="0.000" stopTime="508.839">
            <label>Mr. Morton H. Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.696" offset="26749">Before I get into -- on my argument, I would like to spend two or three minutes to shed some additional light on two other questions that were asked from the bench during the course of petitioner's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.424" offset="81607">The Chief Justice asked whether there was any other means of transportation available to soldiers like Seabourn or whether they had to rely almost exclusively on transportation afforded by the army.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.938" offset="139703">The record -- there are two places in the record at pages 16 and at pages 22, it definitely establishes -- definitely establishes that there was other transportations available, that there was taxi cab transportation available.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.619" offset="202397">That there were -- that -- and that indeed on the day in question, Seabourn, the driver who later took out the army vehicle at night and his two companions had utilized the services of the cab and they already had that very afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.498" offset="277943">The -- the other factual question that was asked was by Mr. Justice Harlan who wanted to know whether there was any evidence as to whether or not Stiles knew that Seabourn was drunk at the time that he took the vehicle off the post or has been drinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.347" offset="393300">I -- I should like to point out that there is some slight evidence with what -- there was considerable evidence on that sort in Sergeant Stiles' affidavit, which as my adversary has correctly pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.001" offset="447948">It was stricken from the record on his motion at the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.293" offset="477100">For that reason, I will not discuss its content.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.941" offset="491729">However, there was other information that was -- there was other evidence that was properly admitted at page 17 of the record which indicates that during the daytime, Seabourn was not drunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.275" offset="545019">That information is set forth in the first full paragraph at the top of page 17 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.892" offset="571559">However I should like to point this out, that we do not believe that the question as to whether or not the Government was negligent or as to whether or not Sergeant Stiles was negligent in entrusting a vehicle to Seabourn is at all before this Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.197" offset="652748">This case and the complaint in this case is not predicated on the allegation that the Government was negligent because Sergeant Stiles negligently entrusted a vehicle to Corporal Seabourn.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.895" offset="699559">The allegation in the complaint is limited exclusively -- exclusively limited to the asserted negligence on the part of Seabourn in operating the vehicle after he had obtained it.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.995" offset="747938">And obviously, since that is the only issue of negligence which was raised by the complaint, it was the only issue of negligence with respect to which the Government put on any defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.789" offset="787122">It was the only issue of negligence of course which was with respect to which the Government found it necessary to cross-examine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.468" offset="809796">It was the only issue tried by the Court, that is the issue as to whether or not, Seabourn himself was negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.861" offset="831425">And of course, it was the only issue with respect to which the trial judge made any specific findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.599" offset="854309">That was never raised in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.251" offset="860996">It wasn't even mentioned or suggested in the petition for certiorari in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.866" offset="883461">And we think for those reasons that petitioner actually stopped from asserting at this time as he does in the last part of his brief that this case presents the additional question or suggests that this other avenue of governmental liability that is -- that perhaps the Government was liable in entrusting the vehicle and to -- perhaps the Government through Sergeant Stiles was negligent to entrust and liable in entrusting the vehicle to Corporal Seabourn.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.805" offset="991190">That has never been in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.954" offset="995788">The first time it came into the case, the first time it succeeds upon was in the petition as we come in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.377" offset="1025463">We believe this case actually boils down to this simple proposition reflected by this very brief summary which I am about to give of the operative facts involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.036" offset="1096098">Seabourn, a soldier stationed at Guam, was given a pass so that he could be relieved completely from his military duties for a day or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.329" offset="1153254">He took advantage of that pass and went to the town during the daytime and as I have pointed out, hired a cab with two of his companions during the daytime spending his day -- spending his day in town completely removed from any connection with any official governmental -- with any official governmental duty, completely disassociated from the performance of the routine military mission normally assigned to him in which he was discharging when he was not out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.197" offset="1280731">He spent the whole day on passing town, came back at night and then obtained possession of this vehicle which both courts found, he had obtained in an unauthorized fashion for a use not permitted by the army regulations, for a use not permitted by his superior officers and for a use not permitted by the trip ticket which he used in order to remove the vehicle from the post.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.672" offset="1390655">Having obtained that vehicle, he went out with his two companions on a drinking spree.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.354" offset="1413329">He was, as the evidence shows that he -- that he was -- there was overwhelming evidence the courts pointed out, that he was very seriously intoxicated at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.068" offset="1452199">While on that intoxicated state, he went joyriding with this vehicle and crashed into the car in which petitioner was sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.382" offset="1485427">Now we believe that under that basic factual setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.259" offset="1504967">No court -- no court in the land has and we do no think that any court in the land should hold that the employer of -- the employer of the person who, on a day-off, takes unauthorized possession of an employer's vehicle, uses it for a purpose prohibit -- uses it for a purpose prohibited by his employer, uses it for a purpose in no way connected -- in no way connected with the discharge of the duties assigned to that employee in the scope of his employment.We believe that under that factual setup, no court in the land has and no court in the land should uphold the employer liable under a theory of respondeat superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.939" offset="1671732">The touchstone of which and the chief criterion which must be met is performance of some business on behalf of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.692" offset="1714678">That of course is the -- the essential, the logical, the only rational justification for imposing vicarious liabilities on an employer not for his tort but for some tort committed by his employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.531" offset="1766087">That justification is that the employee at the time was performing some work of interest to the employer was in some way performing some duty the employer had assigned to him and for that reason, the courts have always imposed this respondeat superior liability which compels the master to answer for the tort of the service committed by the servant while the servant was acting within the scope of his employment and while the servant while then acting was actively discharging some business of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.533" offset="1894087">Now that same traditional -- that fundamental concept of respondeat superior was not -- was not ignored by Congress when they've taken the -- the Tort Claims Act to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.232" offset="1936927">Congress used very precise language to make absolute and certain that that in our concept of respondeat superior would be transplanted into the Tort Claims Act, so that the United States, under the Tort Claims Act can be held liable only -- only where its employee has committed a tort while he was acting within the scope of his employment.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="508.839" offset="2035252">Mr. Hollander, if your facts will change somewhat to this effect, if it was the custom for about 18 months at that camp to permit the enlisted personnel to use the trucks after the regular working hours in a day for the purpose of going to this limited places of amusements such as this camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.913" offset="2159595">And if this man drank as many servicemen do at such --- such places and had this accident, would you say that that would change the situation?</text>

            <label>Mr. Morton H. Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="553.404" offset="2213616">I -- I should not think, Your Honor, that that would affect a governmental immunity from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.503" offset="2237962">I think that in that situation, if the employee even though specifically authorized to use the vehicle was using it on a personal purpose, was using it for his own convenience, for his own pleasure, was using it for a reason which in no way furthered the official military duties to which he has been assigned, I think that in that situation there -- there still would not be liability under the respondeat superior theory of liability which is predicated -- which is predicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.207" offset="2352797">Every court passing on the problem has held on the employee's performance of a function of interest to his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.874" offset="2391458">The employee must at the time be furthering his employer's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.965" offset="2407758">There may be other addends of liability under which a private employer may, in a situation which the Chief Justice puts, be held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.118" offset="2444434">There is in California for example a permissive use statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.828" offset="2467213">Under that statute -- under that statute, it is possible for an employer who authorizes an employee to use the employer's vehicle to be held liable for the negligent operation of that vehicle even though the vehicle was not being operated within the scope of the -- of the employee's employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.936" offset="2547670">Indeed it is possible under the permissive use statute in California and we point out in our brief in about nine other states for the owner of the vehicle after having authorized its use by some other person to be liable for its negligent operation even though the person whose use is authorized had no employment relationship whatsoever to the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.240" offset="2632934">It can be a friend or any -- anybody to whom their vehicle was entrusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.901" offset="2647562">Under the permissive use statute theory of liability, it is possible beyond the respondeat superior scope of employment field to fasten liability on the owner of such a vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.282" offset="2697091">I would like to point this out that California recognizes the sharp distinction between that type of liability which perhaps, Your Honor, has in mind and the normal respondeat superior liability where the employer may be held liable only where the employee is furthering employer's business or acting within the scope of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.086" offset="2764278">California in fact limits the liability of the owner of the vehicle under the permissive use statute theory of liability to $5000 for personal injuries.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.995" offset="6651925">Answer - Yes, sir, that is correct, although, I don't know if this vessel -- this vehicle, had a trip ticket.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.759" offset="7250965">But the method of obtaining trip tickets was to take the vehicle kept in the squadron area down to the dispatch office, obtain a trip ticket from the dispatcher who was on duty and there was a dispatcher on duty 24 hours a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.873" offset="7311464">Question - When Seabourn states in his statement, the trip tickets and service truck were always passed around between the men working in that section regardless of the name of the individual the trip ticket was made out to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.681" offset="7358694">State how long such a procedure had been followed to your knowledge in your section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.996" offset="7375935">Answer - The procedure was followed in the section I was in as long as I was assigned to the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.207" offset="7404774">I was in the section about a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.125" offset="7412402">Question - When Seabourn set forth in his statement, that was the usual procedure whether the -- whether the use of the vehicle was official business or recreation of the individual using it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.839" offset="7459318">State how long that procedure had been followed to your knowledge in your section before the collision?</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.148" offset="7480529">Answer - That procedure was also followed during the time I was in the section and I had been in the section about a year before March 03, 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.370" offset="7521384">Question - State the individuals in your section who followed that procedure including officers and enlisted men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.918" offset="7547611">Answer - All the men in the section used the truck and some of the men that I remember who were in my section were private first-class Slinker, Sergeant Herrera, Lieutenant John Reese, the same as I mentioned before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.867" offset="7603409">And Your Honor, without laboring them out of here, the same testimony was given by Seabourn on pages 126, 127, 130 and 131.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.500" offset="7645936">I did wish to advert to counsel's statement that I was basing my case on this permissive use statute of California, I am not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.363" offset="7681358">California follows the respondeat theory doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.704" offset="7698808">The permissive use statute is merely a statute which says that if you permit someone to take your vehicle, you -- you are responsible up to a given sum of $5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.095" offset="7740291">But the Murphey case points out that California follows the traditional common law, respondeat theory superior doctrine and which can't be found in federal law since there is no federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.369" offset="7809463">Now that's pointed out here in the Murphey case and in the Murphey case the man was authorized, Your Honors, to take the vehicle, drive to the town of Klamath in Northern California and instructed to park the car right at the place of amusement, namely, the movie house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.038" offset="7876127">He deviated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.351" offset="7881352">He didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.870" offset="7887412">He took the car, brought some men down and then departed and deviated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.259" offset="7908937">He went then to -- of course, to pick up some women.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.448" offset="7933701">And then he had something to drink.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.521" offset="7942060">And then when he -- he was going away in some prohibited mission to, namely, to an Indian ceremonial and while enroute on this deviated, departure mission, he caused a death in the Ninth Circuit in 179 F.2nd, 743 reversed the trial court and held that under the law of California, applicable under the Federal Torts Claim Act, that the Government in this case intended and the Congress intended to assume that risk can bear that burden.</text>
