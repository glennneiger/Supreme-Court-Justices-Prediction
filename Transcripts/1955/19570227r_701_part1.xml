            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="29.354" offset="223838">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.050" offset="238676">This case involves the reargument case, the Court handed down the opinion by a spring and the question presented is whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to confer jurisdiction on a court-martial to try a dependent wife of a member of the U.S. Air Force residing in public quarters on a base in a foreign country for alleged murder of her husband there.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.464" offset="372318">If Court asked for general reargument, as we understand, but also asked for such answers as we are able to give to certain specific questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.506" offset="424458">The particular questions were the specific practical necessities in the Government and Regulation of the land and naval forces which justify court-martial jurisdiction over civilian dependents overseas, the practical alternatives to the exercise of jurisdiction by court-martial to the historical evidence so far as such evidence is available and relevant bearing on the scope of court-martial jurisdiction authorized under Article I, Section 8, clause 14 in the Necessary Proper Clause and bearing on the relations of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments in interpreting those clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.454" offset="600210">In particular, the question whether such historical evidence points to the conclusion that the Article I, Section 8, Clause 14 power was thought to have a fixed and rigid content, or rather that this power is modified by the Necessity and -- Necessary Proper Clause was considered a broad grant susceptible of expansion under changing circumstances, three, the relevance for purposes of court-martial jurisdiction over civilians overseas in time of peace of any distinction between civilians employed by the Armed Forces and civilian dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.764" offset="757467">With regard to that question, I take it, there's no problem between counsel in the case because they disagree that there is no distinction between civilian dependants and civilian employees for constitutional purpose by the parties and their briefs in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.375" offset="831969">The relevance -- number four, the relevance for purposes of court-martial jurisdiction over civilian dependents overseas in time of peace of any distinctions between major crimes and petty offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.696" offset="897275">Before addressing ourselves on behalf of the Government to the particular questions asked by the Court, I would like to review very briefly the principles involved we think that are controlling to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.241" offset="955371">First place, Government contends that there's no question about the power of the United States to try persons such as the defendants for crimes committed in a foreign country, the trial to be held in the foreign country by the United States that that is a power that is resident in the United States by reason of its sovereignty and is based upon what this Court has said in Curtis Reid and the U.S. against Belmont, U.S. against Pink and other similar cases in regard to that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.883" offset="1113987">Secondly, we believed that the Court opinion in which reliance was placed on the historical views of a consular court, In re Ross is fully supported by the action of this Court in the past and that that power as delineated there, the sovereign power of the United States is a justification and basis for the action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.434" offset="1236135">I might call particular attention to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.842" offset="1245853">There are some question now in the briefs about whether counsel did concede that a trial by such a consular court at this time, being last spring or when the case was argued, could be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.814" offset="1309696">But in the briefs at this time, there is no argument that there was not a power in the United States prior to adoption of the Constitution exempting particularly and specifically the consular courts so that it is recognized by both parties that prior to the adoption of the Constitution, there was a power to try by means of the concept of a consular court, persons such as the defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.800" offset="1445637">Now, we do not think that that power merely died because of the problem in regard to extraterritoriality.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.376" offset="1487956">What is involved in that concept is the right of the United States as a sovereign to try a citizen by something different than a court requiring a jury trial and a grand jury's indictment and the other -- or Article III requirements as to tenure of -- of the judges and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.542" offset="1600596">And that certainly, the United States, if it had the power prior to the adoption of Constitution to exercise the trial, all of the trials or a person such as the defendant by a consular court could improve that court and make more due process and add to the protections and provisions to care for the interest of the defendants and was not limited to whatever limitations there were in the consular form which obviously, both parties were here recognized, all parties were much more -- much less in the protection of the interest of the defendants as far as due process and fair trial is concerned than what we have in courts-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.223" offset="1827338">We also feel that the historical material that we would develop for the Court have in our briefs and will -- presentation here, fully justified the conclusion that in the history of this country and prior to the constitutional convention, the use of court-martials for civilian dependents, as well as civilian employers who were connected in manners similar to what is involved in these cases with the military was the common practice and was a necessary, recognized as a necessary practice in the handling of the disciplinary problems of the forces, both of the British prior to the war period, hostilities, and actually during the revolutionary period, and by our own troops including certain statements by George Washington himself with regard to the problems and difficulties he had with this brief questions.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="505.170" offset="2127120">Mr. Chief Justice, we have so many examples in time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.196" offset="2143211">I don't want to overstate the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.510" offset="2152511">The examples in time of peace are questioned by counsel on the other side saying that in Boston, during the colonial period, the British had declared martial law.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.005" offset="2202457">And we question whether on your -- under any of the concepts that this Court have stated regarding the necessity, a feature of martial law that there could have been martial law in Boston, we don't agree that there was martial law but there is that question that they raised about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.568" offset="2272674">We have in several examples, also a period prior to -- or not during actual hostilities in Canadian activities in -- where there were court-martials and by the British.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.444" offset="2340174">And they questioned those cases saying that although the hostilities, all fighting was over, the British was and there no peace treaty signed, and therefore, it was not actual fighting hostilities at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.760" offset="2397435">And we do not think that that question is valid in view of the circumstances, but we did not find detailed cases beyond that of peacetime except several cases in regard to India that were after the revolutionary period, after the adoption of the Constitution, we don't think that they are as good material, historical to help the Court on the problem as these incidents that occurred prior to the adoption of the Constitution which we can assume from what I will develop here.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.496" offset="2544452">The people in the -- the members of the constitutional convention were well aware of.</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="614.594" stopTime="620.983">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="614.594" offset="2564827">It's your position then that -- that it applies equally in time of peace to time of war?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="620.983" stopTime="852.240">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="620.983" offset="2590427">Yes, but the same problems are developed and the same reasons, which I'll try to show, are the basic reasons for doing it during the war period are present during the peacetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.627" offset="2641000">And that the various commanders in describing their difficulties with -- dealing with various wives and dependents as well as the civilian employees illustrate that they had this disciplinary problem that couldn't be handled, otherwise, and that's why they had to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.556" offset="2716651">The same is true, we think, in peacetime and I will try to develop that.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.903" offset="2762104">Before proceeding to the history, I should like to call briefly at -- the attention of the Court to the case Ex parte Quirin.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.654" offset="2805049">I want to make it unmistakably clear that that is not the same factual situation to this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.753" offset="2833471">There were saboteurs involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.822" offset="2841725">It wasn't the question of military commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.588" offset="2852801">But the Court did very carefully in unanimous opinion examined some of the materials, some of the basic principles involved in the question of whether persons were entitled to a jury trial and grand jury indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.947" offset="2914241">And I think it is quite helpful and would be quite helpful to the Court to examine for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.791" offset="2937647">I do it for that limited purpose only.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.692" offset="2953216">There, the Court said, present by grand jury and trial by a jury of the -- this nature where the crime is committed, where at time of the adoption of the Constitution, familiar parts of the machinery for trial in the civil courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.729" offset="3005356">But they were procedures unknown to military tribunals which are not courts in the sense of the judicial article and which in the natural course of events, are usually called upon to function under conditions precluding, resort to such procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.892" offset="3098039">As this Court has often recognized, it was not the purpose or effect of Section 2 of Article III, read in the light of the common law to enlarge the then existing rights to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.628" offset="3156971">The object was to preserve unimpaired trial by jury in all cases of a light nature as they might arise in the future but not to bring within the sweep of the guarantee, those cases in which it was then well understood that a jury trial could not be demanded as a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.090" offset="3262819">The Fifth and Sixth Amendments, while guaranteeing the continuance of certain incidents of trial by jury, which Article III, Section 2 had left unmentioned, did not enlarge the right to jury trial as it had been established by that Article.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.317" offset="3343694">Then the Court went on to refer to petty offenses, as the illustration citing cases by this Court, trial of criminal contempt, action to enforce a penalty inflicted by Congress, citing cases, and said no exception is necessary to exclude from the operation of these provisions cases never deemed to be within -- within the terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.979" offset="3494369">Now, concerning the application by this Court --</text>

          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="852.955" stopTime="853.474">

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="853.474" offset="3520387">-- this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.117" offset="3522894">Do you -- it is your position then not to -- to insist upon a jury trial of these women in these cases would be to extend the function of the jury rather than to -- to restrict it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="880.024" stopTime="964.311">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="880.024" offset="3626548">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.666" offset="3629160">Now, I'll try to develop that in showing the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.325" offset="3643789">And it seems to me that we have to look back to the time of the constitutional convention and see what was done then, what the common law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.490" offset="3688406">And if at that time there was certain exempt exceptions, and it wasn't conceived that a jury trial and a grand jury indictment pr am Article III Court, were intended to cover a particular activity which we all pretty well conceded about petty offenses for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.331" offset="3771789">Then in -- if that's the kind of a case we have before the Court today, then you can't take and apply jury trial under the decision of Ex parte Quirin and a long list of cases by this Court to that type of action except by saying, “We'll disregard all the traditions in what the Fifth and Sixth Amendment we're trying to do in Article III and we'll extend that regardless.”</text>
            <text syncTime="942.484" offset="3876383">And I think that's the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.438" offset="3884220">Now, whether I can establish that that was the fact is the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.997" offset="3902401">Mr. -- Mr. Solicitor General, as you go along, would you indicate whether you would make the same argument that if these people were guilty or charged, let's say, with treason or other crime other than murder?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="964.311" stopTime="1123.734">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="964.311" offset="3963737">I think there's a little different problem about treason.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.348" offset="3975858">I'll try to cover that.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.486" offset="4004383">I'd like to just say about legislative, of course, that this Court has held in a number of cases implied to the Philippines, Hawaii, the area now known as the State of Florida and other area in the country that was included at that time, when that was still a territory and not incorporated into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.426" offset="4116187">In Puerto Rico and all of those cases that Congress had the power within -- that's what were dealing with here, whether or not Congress has the power on the Constitution to provide for this type of trial, had the power to provide for the trial of persons that in those territories that were not incorporated into the United States by not providing a jury trial or a grand jury indictment unless well established in the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.037" offset="4262578">And we think that is very material to the consideration of this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.258" offset="4291521">It's also applied to the problem of extradition in regard to the area of Cuba, in the Neely case and a very interesting involved presentation by the Court there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.257" offset="4355469">And that the Court held that the territory of Cuba, while as between the United States and other sovereignties, was in an occupied territory insofar as the people of Cuba were concerned and the United States was a foreign country because of the obligation that Congress had recited in legislation to restore as rapidly as possible with the Government in control of that area to the people of Cuba so that in that regard, it is comfortable to the problem here of foreign territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.841" offset="4517846">Now certainly, it seems to us that if it's conceded that the cases involving territory not incorporated into the United States are valid today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.033" offset="4566538">The case involving a foreign country where we don't have that much control of jurisdiction or domination is a fortiori.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.053" offset="6346627">Generally, he finds that the British forces were accompanied by women and children in peacetime prior to the American revolutionary war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.334" offset="6387796">And this is evidenced in -- by several illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.419" offset="6400125">One is that in Jamaica, with the British detachments for more than 100 years, they had women and not only camp followers, but women who were wives of the men in the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.105" offset="6462819">And at the outbreak of the revolution, there is a communication to Lord George Germain ordering a detachment from Jamaica to Virginia of some 374 officers and men, included also 40 women and servants followed by similar detachments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.978" offset="6546307">He also illustrates it with the example of women in Canada with the British troops following the capture of Quebec in 1763 and they reported there with the British troops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.763" offset="6597507">And again, with the French in Canada in the mid 17th Century which this French sent a regiment to Canada for -- accompanied by women and that was in peacetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.922" offset="6654140">And he refers to a letter of Martha May, June 4th, 1758 to Colonel Henry Bouquet from Carlisle, Pennsylvania which she says that she's been traveling 22 years with her husband every place that the company -- the company went.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.918" offset="6742120">In those days, of course, the rations were issued uncooked to the troops but the women performed the function of cooking it, taking care of that and also washing laundry, sewing, nursing -- nursing the -- the called back was a very rough affair at that time and we didn't have the developments that we do, did during later period after Florence Nightingale in regard to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.901" offset="6966042">There were incidents described of whipping with a cat o' nine tails at the back of the wagons and some of the difficulties they had with drunkenness and all kinds of problems that are apparently inherent in such grouping activities and the mixture that was necessary involved in trying to carry on such activity are both met in that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.445" offset="7092266">In the early days, women with the British in the Armed Forces in the British colonial possessions were subject to court-martial in peacetime according to Mr. Blumenthal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.232" offset="7267391">It's also very interesting in the description in a good deal of -- of basic material cited in all the sources, in Mr. Blumenthal's book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.912" offset="7310127">But to one of the difficulties that they had was that they would issue rations to the Armed Forces for so many men, so many wives and women, and so many children that so much ahead the provision for women and children, women being different in that from the men and the provision for the children being different from that for the women, and they would provide so many to a regiment and they found that they had so many more women and dependents along with them than they had contemplated that there was counts in correspondence back and forth between the British generals and other military men trying to explain why they were issuing more rations than they had men for and that they were supposed to have women and to children for and showing -- relating in detail the fact that they had these additional women and children along and they have to be taken care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.813" offset="7573650">It was part of their problem and that it took just that much more money and that much more rations where they were supposed to have some 10% of the number of women and children as they did to the armed -- armed or military men in a certain unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.442" offset="7656197">They would find that they had maybe half as many again and they would be trying to explain that discrepancy in the need for the additional finances and supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.086" offset="7706770">And they did that at some considerable length in addition to describing some of the difficulties of maintaining discipline and I don't want to have to mislead the Court about whether these women or wives or other wives because it -- it's quite apparent from the description that there were both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.031" offset="7786600">And that in some instances, neither the British or even -- it's implied, I think, some of our people were as too careful about whether they were either wives or camp followers because often times it's related to that they became married during the campaign or sometime during the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.523" offset="7892553">But there were people, women without question during the description in this material who were actively trying to help with the conduct of the military activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.685" offset="7953157">And they were providing for these men in a way that was done, men much as women do today and have for as long as we can recall.</text>

            <text syncTime="2058.266" offset="8339560">But I didn't -- I don't think there's any connotation throughout the book that there's any legal relationship for the British hired women to do certain jobs or the American expeditionary force or our revolutionary force hired women to do these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.014" offset="8410509">It was a relationship that grew up because the men needed it and the women went to help them and they were allocated on that basis, first on the theory that so many women, wives of the men that were going over to this country for the British could perform the service and then they added to those, from time to time, brought additional problems, and they did do those various things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.358" offset="8519910">Now, there is the difference that there was the food that was uncooked at that time that there had to be some cooking for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.197" offset="8555227">Now, of course, there isn't any question of what there's -- that function was carried on but it's -- there is also food provided with officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.151" offset="8587097">There's a different arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.888" offset="8593993">Oftentimes, the wives would cook in a place on the base for the -- the officer husband today just like she would do at whatever actively the military were carrying on at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.196" offset="8647178">So, there's a comparable situation about many of the various activities, although it might not be identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.034" offset="8682600">During this period in Colonial Virginia which was of course prior to the revolution, the British, the women with the British troops were subject to court-martial and court-martial was imposed upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.432" offset="8748220">There's also a description of a large contingent of intended brides -- brides who were shipped from England to Jamestown in 1619, and thereafter, became related to the military force that was there, and they were subject to the military authority in peacetime as well as during the Indian hostilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.967" offset="8842261">And in both -- in 1620, in both Colonial Virginia and Provincial Maryland, the women were subject to court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.826" offset="8889699">There was no civil government in a modern sense in those two places during that period of time.</text>
