          <heading>Argument of W. T. Mathews</heading>
          <turn speaker="w_t_mathews" startTime="0.000" stopTime="784.901">
            <label>Mr. W. T. Mathews</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">-- in recess, that the formula had already been prepared with respect to the allocation and apportionment of the water under the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.418" offset="89652">So that it is not necessary now in our estimation for this Court to endeavour to rely on a formula with respect to the apportionment and allocation of the water rights that has already been accomplished by the Compact and negotiation of seven states, the ratification held by six states almost immediately after the adoption of the Compact where the result and ratification of the Compact some 15 years later by the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.410" offset="285571">Now, the intervention of the United States in this case, to my mind, has opened the door wisely for the joinder of all of the Upper Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.528" offset="386090">The reason for that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.727" offset="398838">Under Article VII of the Colorado River Compact, the negotiators at that time already considered the beneficial consumptive use of the waters of the river so far as the United States is concerned, as that pertaining to the Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.453" offset="485773">However, from the Upper Basin States adopted after a negotiation, the Upper Colorado River Compact, they wrote into that Compact in Article 19, paragraph (c), a very broad comprehensive provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.524" offset="574067">In that, that provision provides that nothing in the Upper Colorado River Compact should, in any way, detract from the rights of the Unites States for the use of waters within the Upper Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.824" offset="643239">And so, when we find the United States alleging in its petition and intervention, not only for beneficial consumptive use of the waters of the river, stream system for the Indian tribes alone, we find that it is bond its claims in the Lower Basin to include fish and wildlife, to include national parks, forest service and many other departments of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.827" offset="791301">Now, when the United States did that in his petition, it raises a serious question in view of the fact that in the Lower Basin in the States of Arizona and California, United States lays claim to someone 1,800,000 acre feet of water for beneficial consumptive use in those two States for Indian tribes alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.874" offset="891402">And then, it alleges in his petition these other projects which will require water and they do not say how much nor when.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.171" offset="936647">So, when we come to apply the provisions of the Colorado River Compact of 1922, whereby, the Upper Basin States were apportioned for beneficial consumptive use 7,500,000 acre feet of water, 7,500,000 acre feet of the -- of the water that's free system was apportioned to the Lower Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.260" offset="1064960">The Lower Basin States was split to a certain standpoint by reason of the inclusion therein, apportions of Utah and New Mexico for the smaller portion of Arizona allocated to the Upper Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.279" offset="1137058">Now, that amount of water was apportioned by negotiators and perpetuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.153" offset="1168509">Then, in Article III (b), the same negotiators extend that right to the Lower Basin States to the extent of 1,000,000 acre feet per annum in addition for beneficial consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.092" offset="1244264">Those are matters stands before this Court today.There is, in our opinion, a direct final basic apportionment of water to the lower basin for beneficial consumptive use of 8,500,000 acre feet of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.048" offset="1340186">Very well, where does the quick both of this water comes from?</text>
            <text syncTime="342.280" offset="1369025">It arises, I'm sure, and this Court could take judicial knowledge of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.512" offset="1393998">That could create apportionment of that water arises in Wyoming with a greater portion in Colorado, the smaller portion in Utah borders, likewise in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.952" offset="1455752">So that those Upper Basin States are faced with this problem, that when 8,500,000 acre feet of water are put to a beneficial consumptive use in the Lower Basin and I assure this Court that the need is presently, not 1963, but now.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.202" offset="1552718">So that when you couple with that, 750,000 acre feet of water per annum from the Upper Basin which must go to Mexico, that is not a beneficial consumptive use in this country, that is true, but it is a beneficial use in this respect insofar that the use of that water beneficially in this State, except perhaps for the generation of power for a short time is lost to the States of the United States along the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.376" offset="1709453">Then, you add to that what United States claim, there is no definite allocation here of water to the United States from the Colorado River Compact, neither is there a definite allocation of water to United States in the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.637" offset="1790537">And on that question, I desire to state most and privately to this Court that United States is definitely bound by the Colorado River Compact by reason of the fact that the Congress of the United States has so bounded in the Project Act in Section 8 and Section 13 (b) of that Act, and to make sure that that matter would continue in that status when they adopted the Boulder Canyon Project Adjustment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.748" offset="1938913">Several years later, Congress took particular pains to reenact the provision of Section 14 of the Project Act and amended Section 18 of the Adjustment Act, making that a definite holding so far as Congress is concerned, so that we have the situation, if the Court please, that notwithstanding the petition of the United States for America in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.744" offset="2070883">In one of the allegations of their petition, they denied or rather, United States denies that it is bound by the terms of that Compact, notwithstanding expressed language expressed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.331" offset="2149251">How does that affect this particular case at the State of Wyoming and Colorado, widely intricate in this matter, or are they as they claim, having settled the rights among themselves in their probation?</text>
            <text syncTime="560.492" offset="2241933">They are not concerned with what goes on in the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.178" offset="2268682">I'd say in my opinion that that statement and that holding on the part of those two featured states as far have fetched.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.728" offset="2314867">They have agreed that so much the waters will go down in the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.772" offset="2343079">They have agreed that the Lower Basin should be entitled to so many acre feet of water per annum.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.241" offset="2376934">They have agreed that they will not withhold water in the Upper Basin, and the Lower Basin has agreed it will not require the deliberative water which cannot be placed to reasonable beneficial consumptive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.068" offset="2452271">But nevertheless, how can they say that they are not interested in what goes on to the Lower Basin with respect to the waters?</text>
            <text syncTime="632.072" offset="2528235">Because if they take that attitude and -- and oddly by for a period of time and the Lower Basin goes ahead and uses that water as it comes down to the stream, then at some later date, perhaps, five years from now, 10 years from now, the Upper Basin States will be before this Court saying, “The Lower Basin has exceeded its powers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="661.260" offset="2644950">They're taking the water that belongs to us over a period of years and we wish to have it stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.470" offset="2673789">That brings up a question, if this Court please, that we now have a situation that confronted this Court back in 241 U.S., the Pacific Livestock Company case construing the water law of the State of Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.714" offset="2754769">This Court followed the holding of the Supreme Court of this -- of that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.381" offset="2777443">Upon this point, there had been an adjudication of the water rights under the Oregon law, and the Court held that that was the proper thing to do in advance of the determination of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.870" offset="2847451">First, they were adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.095" offset="2856333">We have that situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.715" offset="2862811">They're adjudicated under the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.283" offset="2881097">So, in all that remains in this case at the present time, if this Court please, is only an interpretation of the Boulder Canyon Project Act as it relates to water problems of both the Upper and Lower Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.141" offset="2948493">When that judicial interpretation of the Compact, drawing, flying to the conclusion as to what that language means, then, I assure this Court that the case can be very quickly dispose off.</text>

          <heading>Argument of John P. Frank</heading>
          <turn speaker="john_p_frank" startTime="784.901" stopTime="1919.496">
            <label>Mr. John P. Frank</label>
            <text syncTime="784.901" offset="3139500">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.666" offset="3150576">In the matter which is before you, the division of time which has been arranged among those of us who represent the upholders of the Master's report is that I shall address myself principally to the case law aspects of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.655" offset="3210553">Mr. Chilson, representing the Upper Basin, will speak principally as to the application of the legal principles to the facts and Governor McFarland closing for -- both of us will discuss the policy aspects of the matter which may relate to such discretion as the Court feels that it has in connection with the problem of joinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.390" offset="3297489">However, while I wish to discuss with you primarily the principles, both of joinder parties and of justiciability, I would like to add a word or two first as to the facts of the matter pointing out those elements which seem to us important in supplement to what Mr. Ely has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.603" offset="3366348">In the first place, it is quite so that what we are interpreting here is the Colorado River Compact of 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.057" offset="3396127">Now, the Colorado River Compact of 1922 was adopted largely at the instance of the State of California for the reason suggested by Mr. Ely, namely, that this area was in danger of flood and also needed water control, and therefore, it was necessary to put in what is now the Hoover Dam up here for the purpose of controlling these waters below.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.907" offset="3495602">On the other hand, there was a great risk for all the other States that their rapidly growing neighbor, California might, under the doctrine of prior appropriation, get all of the water if this were down, and hence, it was necessary to make some effort to divide it up before California could be allowed to have the Hoover Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.928" offset="3567700">In this connection, the first effort that was made was the effort to divide the water by states to allocate so much to each of the States of the Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.378" offset="3613466">I stress this because it proved impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.906" offset="3623602">Months and months went by of unsuccessful negotiation and attempt to arrive at a division by States.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.945" offset="3651709">And finally, after adjournments and failures, the great compromise of the Colorado River Compact was devised, and I stress that Compact not compromised because it dominated the thinking of the Master and is indeed in the history of this matter a compromise is important as the great constitutional compromises of 1787.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.470" offset="3733838">And that was the compromise not to attempt to divide the water by States, but instead, to divide it by basins.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.435" offset="3761737">And so, a line was drawn through here and a provision was made that there should be two basins as shown on the map in the fashion which I think is clear and that the Upper Basin should have the obligation of letting some 75,000,000 acre feet of water come down pass Lee's Ferry each ten-year period and the dividing point was carefully put here at a point far removed from population in either direction, a distance for practical purposes between the diversions is as great as the distance from New York to Charleston.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.206" offset="3904784">And on that basis, it proved possible to work out the Compact having made the great compromise and division into basins.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.471" offset="3933832">And then, the matter proceeded in the course of ratification and as -- as has been said, the ratification proved slow in large part for resistance from my own State.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.257" offset="3973016">And finally, the plan was worked out of letting the Boulder Dam go through in the course of the Project Act and I would give a somewhat different emphasis to that Project Act, and thus, Mr. Ely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.681" offset="4022648">As we read those of its provisions which relate to the Limitation Act, we understand it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.021" offset="4048039">That California was given a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.104" offset="4056398">It was given a choice either of getting the Boulder Dam after all states had ratified or of getting the Boulder Dam after six states had ratified, plus passing its own Limitation Act in a period of as little as six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.047" offset="4116167">In short, as we construe the statute, the Limitation Act was the price that California had to pay to get the go ahead sign on the Boulder Dam in the six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.075" offset="4160261">Now, that Limitation Act, which contained provisions which California now contends, are no longer binding on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.307" offset="4201221">The Act said this statute shall be, "irrevocable and unconditional," giving benefits to all the States involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.453" offset="4237793">California now contends that it is both revocable and conditional, and that is one of the issues which doubtless would sooner or later have to be decided on the merits by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.924" offset="4271647">There is another provision in the Compact Act which I would like to stress which has not been mentioned so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.356" offset="4297352">And that is a provision of Article IV (a) which is most remarkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.706" offset="4322743">It contained a proposed compact for the Lower Basin States, known as the Tri-state compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.818" offset="4355239">And this Compact was approved in advance by the Congress, and that proposed Compact in IV (a) provided that Arizona should have 2,800,000 acre feet of mainstream water, plus the use of the waters of the Hula, which, in effect, comes to the 3,000,000 acre which we are now talking about in this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.973" offset="4435801">In short, what we are seeking here is exactly what is in the Compact to prove in advance in IV (a) of the Project Act in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.994" offset="4471954">That Compact, after a period of jacking between the States was eventually ratified by the State of Arizona after the congressional approval but has never been approved by California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.987" offset="4519915">Another event worth a little more mention is the 1944 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.327" offset="4541231">In 1944, the State of Arizona entered into its contract with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.678" offset="4562651">That contract allowed to Arizona exactly what had been set up originally in the so-called tri-state compact that I just described, namely, and allows 2,800,000 acre feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.631" offset="4614478">On one point, I am over simplified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.160" offset="4624614">The allowance of 2,800,000 acre feet of mainstream water to Arizona includes the allowance for the lower basin sectors of New Mexico and Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.364" offset="4665365">That is this little area here and this little area here must ride with us, and that is why the Master found that they had to be in the case because whatever we get, we must share with them in this limited area of both of those states which is in the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.151" offset="4724506">I use the shorthand phrase of our claim but it is also theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.569" offset="4742269">It is worth adding this as to the 1944 contract, and that is that since we were not then parties to the Compact, it was provided that as a condition of getting the contract, we have to ratify the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.800" offset="4795141">And California, among others, was very enthusiastic that we should.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.915" offset="4807576">We know this because the contract itself was drafted in negotiations by a committee which represented all of the States, known as the committee of 14 or 16, since we were not then parties to the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.212" offset="4868807">And it was approved by all of the States, except California and then, upon full scale hearing by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.132" offset="4900467">It is our rights under that contract, which are the same as what was allowed to us under IV (a) of the Compact which is what we are seeking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.751" offset="4934949">Now, one other element of fact that need stressing perhaps is the fact that in 1948 and 1949, the Upper Basin States preceeded to prepare and adopt a compact of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.437" offset="4989701">And that Upper Basin Compact, which has been approved by Congress and is, now in effect, settles for those States all of the matters which are in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.637" offset="5026482">They have adopted for themselves the definitions which will have to be worked out for the Lower Basin in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.348" offset="5053336">I shall come back to that in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.129" offset="5064516">Let me go back to the moment of our contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.668" offset="5074651">In 1944, Arizona have the contract and then set about to which he used its contract for water?</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.966" offset="5107775">And so, it developed a program known as the Central Arizona Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.275" offset="5125016">Now, that project is a program which will lift our water out of the river here with great lifts which are similar to those which California uses to take water to Los Angeles, and brings that water across the State down into the central area which is where the great drought is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.216" offset="5192829">And that permits exchanges down to this area and up into New Mexico, so that the Central Arizona Project in short is a gigantic reclamation program which has as its purpose the using of the water which we have contracted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.340" offset="5257300">That legislation, the Central Arizona Project legislation twice passed the Senate of the United States in both the 80th and the 81st Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.147" offset="5288542">It was opposed there by California which contended that before it could be adopted the -- that there were clouds on the title to our water that there were a so-called three issues which had to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.297" offset="5349146">And those three issues were spoken out constantly in the course of the consideration of that legislation and they were, first of all, the problem of the relation of Article III (a) and III (b) of the Compact as it relates to the Lower Basin States, a problem of the definition of the terms, “apportionment and surplus,” second, a problem of the definition of the term, “beneficial consumptive use,” and third, a problem of the evaporation losses and their distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.483" offset="5457920">Now, as expression of political matter, Arizona can get legislation through the Senate but California has greater influence in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.109" offset="5488431">And as a result, our legislation founded in the House and a House Committee there decided that it would not adopt this -- this legislation without first getting a determination of those three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.624" offset="5550393">That was a matter which was thoroughly considered in many committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.713" offset="5566798">And doubts and fears were expressed by the Upper Basin States that they might become involved, but they were constantly assured by the representatives of California that this would never happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.299" offset="5613192">I quote that “There were no issues respecting the Upper Basin States and that hence the three issues could be solved without them."</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.325" offset="5645270">And so, after the action of the House Committee, it became necessary for us to institute this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.414" offset="5665646">Meanwhile, the Upper Basin, to ensure that they will not be involved, proceeded as I have said speedily to adopt their own compact which settled every one of these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.244" offset="5700963">So, before themselves, they've decided what evaporation means or what beneficial consumptive use means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.211" offset="5724787">And then, we instituted this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.896" offset="5735549">In this action, we ask that they'll be quieted in us out of the Lower Basin water, that water which had been set up for us in the proposed tri-state compact, that water which we had contracted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.345" offset="5785287">We ask that there be determined the three issues and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.117" offset="5800438">We were scrupulously careful to keep within the terms of that which the Congress seemed to require of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.801" offset="5827187">Thereafter, there was intervention by Nevada and by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.373" offset="5845473">The matter was referred by a Utah Master and finally some 22 months after this action was instituted, California made its motion and I may add a year after the -- after it had answered, California made its motion for joinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.389" offset="5905554">He then referred the joinder questions to the Master and the Master heard argument on the subject for some four days and inspected the area which was involved and considered it extremely thoroughly and filed voluminous report which you have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.525" offset="5962083">Now, the position of the Master, I would like briefly to summarize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.668" offset="5978593">It moved from two fundamental conceptions, and those conceptions were so basic to everything that he did that you will, perhaps, want to examine them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.692" offset="6018717">The first was his conception, that the division of the Colorado area into two basins had been a great policy decision which ought to be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.154" offset="6060513">And related to that, he followed what he considered to be the teaching of this Court in many cases, namely, that problems were impossible to be solved by Compact rather than by litigation, and that since this problem had been so large in extent sold by Compact, he was determined to carry out the principles of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.677" offset="6138671">Second, he adhered with fervor to the principle that justiciability was required in interstate litigation as in any other litigation, and that the principles of justiciability applied to the joinder parties as well as to all of the other matters which were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.667" offset="6210664">California had contended not to come back to this in a moment, but the principal of case in controversy has no bearing on joinder, and that once there is a main suit, any parties can be joined without reference to justiciability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.344" offset="6257371">In this field, the Master did not accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.144" offset="6268552">Now, on the particular issues, he decided that on the question of beneficial consumptive use on the III (b) problem, the meaning of apportionment and surplus and on the evaporation problem in essence is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.827" offset="6319229">First, that the Upper Basin had decided these questions for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.571" offset="6338247">Second, that they could be decided in the Lower Basin without any regard to the decisions of the Upper Basin except to study and observe and just consider whether they should be transferred below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.892" offset="6387566">He said, "To disregard this action and the other actions that may follow under the Upper Basin Compact, unless wholly necessary under sound, legal and equitable principles, would be enacted plainly under oath denounced policies of this Court should not be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.851" offset="6463321">Now, the next branch of the matter was the matter which related to Arizona as contact with both the Compact and the Limitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.523" offset="6498011">As to the question of whether Arizona's ratification of the Compact is valid, I should mention that in the many years which this matter has been under consideration, that issue has, I think, never been raised until exceedingly recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.256" offset="6549002">The Master took this view that whether our ratification of the Compact was effective or ineffective, would make no difference in terms of the relief that we had asked, but since all that we had asked for was not an equitable apportionment of the whole stream but merely our share of the Lower Basin water, that whether we were in the Compact or out would make no difference because we could get only this much anyway and the Upper Basin States would not be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.970" offset="6659866">Secondly, the Master might have considered the point which we have briefed to you in the briefs which are now before you, namely, that this is for reasons which we have set forth there, virtually, a frivolous question in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.785" offset="6711066">Now, on the Limitation Act point, he took essentially the same point of view that the matter need not be involved here that the claims were only as to Lower Basin water that that was all that needed to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.619" offset="6758400">He dealt more briefly with the position of the United States, and that, let me explain was because the 12 acre-figure of United States claims was, I think, not pressed upon him there as I recall it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.486" offset="6817855">And so perhaps he didn't consider the number as vividly as he might.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.417" offset="6833633">Let me explain the figure which has been used of the so-called 12 acre-foot claim of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.197" offset="6864771">That -- the claims of the United States were set forth in its petition for intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.436" offset="6885669">The 12 acre-foot figure, which has been added up by counsel for California, include something like 8,500,000 acre feet which is the obligation of the United States under all of its contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.242" offset="6940944">In order words, it is a complete duplicate of the amounts which the various states claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.897" offset="6959543">It is simply a different interest representing the same quantity of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.069" offset="6976261">This is not a matter of a claim of 7,000,000 or 8,000,000 feet by us, plus the claim by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.390" offset="7001548">These are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.225" offset="7004891">It is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.028" offset="7012101">They are saying that the United States has an obligation to deliver us what we claim we have a privilege to -- to receive, and this obviously can't be aggregated as if they were two separate amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.150" offset="7064555">The actual claims of the United States as set forth here are 747,000 acre feet of diversion for Indian uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.373" offset="7101440">Now, please let me know if I used the term diversion which is technical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.968" offset="7115860">That means that the water diverted for that purpose, much of it will return to the streams, but fraction, I don't know, but let's assume a third, a half of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.929" offset="7147624">So that the amount actually to be used by the United States under its present claims is a few hundred thousand acre feet, and the amount for fish and wildlife is another 35,000 -- 80,000, something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.508" offset="7189943">It is said forth here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.727" offset="7198824">And in addition to that, there is such claim as there maybe under the Mexican matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.961" offset="7211781">I should take that up in just a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.905" offset="7219618">But the consequence is, that the actual aggregate claim of the United States or what might be called new water, is somewhere in the nature of, let me use, around a number of acre feet depending on whether you take its additional claims or its present claims, plus whatever is involved on the Mexican treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.202" offset="7288790">Now, as to both of those points, the Master reached this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.311" offset="7309166">First, as to the Indians, the Master concluded, that the Compact had allocated the Indian responsibilities to the Upper Division and the lower division separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.535" offset="7354096">See, Your Honors, you cannot consider this as though the Indians were somehow just a vast mass of -- of people known as the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.000" offset="7379905">These are particular tribes with particular claims and particular history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.348" offset="7397355">And the Master shrank, as indeed he might, from the problem of working out the histories and rights of any more tribes than actually had to be faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.046" offset="7432150">He took the view that these had been allocated by the Compact to the division separately, and that the only question to be decided was whether the obligation should rest on Arizona which has almost all of them or whether it should be spread over the other States of the Lower Basin, and as to that, he found no interest in the Upper Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.331" offset="7501322">As to the Mexican burden, the essence of the Master's view was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.976" offset="7519817">He adhered throughout, as I have said, to the principle of case in controversy to the requirement of the existence of a present need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.831" offset="7551269">Now, the situation is, that this area, the Upper Basin is, in fact, now using something like 2,500,000 acre feet or what is allowed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.454" offset="7589721">And if the broadest legislation now offered in Congress should be adopted, it would be some 30 years before their use would increase to over 4,000,000 acre feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.484" offset="7629845">And the view of the Master was, that in those circumstances, the possible remote interest in such matters as the Mexican treaty, was, I think, not worthy of immediate consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.661" offset="7670596">At least this is the argument -- I beg your pardon, sir?</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.930" offset="10611670">Now, there is a tricky question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.576" offset="10618253">I could go into it if you wish, which it depends and which affects the question of what is surplus, because California gets half the surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.249" offset="10652944">Then, we claim that a certain million acre feet is not surplus, and therefore, they're not entitled to half of it and they claimed that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.261" offset="10680947">But that is the point of which the controversy turns.</text>

            <text syncTime="2689.179" offset="10756702">Now, if I may go on to the case material which may concern you, we are dealing -- it is suggested with Rules 19 and 20 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.840" offset="10807275">I would like a little later to come back to the question of whether those rules really apply to original actions in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.716" offset="10830785">But for the moment, assuming for the sake of discussion that they do, we have to consider first the question of indispensable parties that the Upper Basin States are indispensable, of course, they would be to be joined but nobody including California contends that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.152" offset="10884598">Second, the question of necessary parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.622" offset="10898390">Third, the question of proper parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.009" offset="10911974">Now, the leading case on this entire subject is the case of Nebraska against Wyoming and it is our principle reliance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.430" offset="10941649">In that State, the basic situation was this, that the North Platte River rose in Colorado, flow into Wyoming and on into Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.240" offset="10984908">The action was brought by the State of Nebraska against Wyoming for the purpose of settling certain questions as between themselves and Wyoming moved to dismiss on the grounds that Colorado was an indispensable party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.608" offset="11042377">On the other hand, Nebraska took the view that they were at most proper party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.345" offset="11069336">This Court, after fully considering the matter, found that Colorado was not rendered an indispensable party, and that the action need not be dismissed and in fact they went further and Mr. Justice Robert said that Colorado was not an indispensable party or unnecessary party because, said the Court, "Nebraska asserts no wrongful act of Colorado and prays no relief against her."</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.436" offset="11189708">Now that, Your Honors, is the identical situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.405" offset="11205590">No one asserts any wrongful act against any of the Upper Basin States and no one prays for any relief against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.199" offset="11236728">After that happened, Wyoming filed an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.398" offset="11257522">And in his answer, it specifically asked for an equitable apportionment of the whole stream, and in addition to that, it specifically alleged that there were present threats against the stream by Colorado then in existence, which made it impossible to allocate the water of the lower riparian States without at the same time considering the upper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.361" offset="11357414">And on the basis of that, this Court then joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.324" offset="11377267">Now, let me put with that before I attempt to analyze the rule, the case of United States against West Virginia, because that case was decided here between the first Nebraska-Wyoming and the second Nebraska-Wyoming case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.871" offset="11431393">These -- these were separated only by a few months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.872" offset="11439438">In United States against West Virginia, United States brought an action against the State of West Virginia, alleging that West Virginia was interfering with its use of the water on the new river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.343" offset="11489280">And how was West Virginia doing it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.992" offset="11495967">It was licensing private companies to build establishments and works on the new river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.949" offset="11527732">And this claim created a controversy between United States and West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.021" offset="11548003">And this Court, in dismissing the action, said that since the bill in a suit, I quote Mr. Justice Stone, “Neither asks the protection nor alleges the invasion of any property rights, and that there was no adequate allegation of any interference by West Virginia."</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.500" offset="11617907">And then, it went on to say something which fits this case to a perfection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.388" offset="11633476">It said, "A difference of opinion between the officials of two Governments is all that was involved and this Court does not exist to settle such differences of opinion."</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.399" offset="11669525">Now, in that case, West Virginia had actually licensed to conflicting uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.657" offset="11698573">I think putting the cases together, decided all of them within a few months of each other that we get basically what might be called this rule that where an upper riparian owner or State is interested only because it's there, because the water comes from there, then this Court has held that that's not reason enough to join it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.859" offset="11843396">That is exactly right, Your Honor, and that reaches what is to us the most compelling matter of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.745" offset="11862936">Indeed, Mr. Justice Douglas, you may recall that in the final, there was a third opinion on this subject at the late stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.478" offset="11889894">And in that stage, Colorado again raised the question of whether it might be eliminated from the suit and the opinion said, "No stressing that there was no compact."</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.595" offset="11934302">Now, we are contending that the principles of that case would be binding if there were no Compact here that we would be bound by the first Nebraska-Wyoming decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.166" offset="11980591">But our a fortiori, we are particularly bound in a case like this where the States have done their dead level best to settle these questions for themselves by Compact and not merely by one compact but by two, and where the Upper Basin States are very carefully by Compact, settled the questions which are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.000" offset="12055928">We think that our situation is even stronger than the cases which are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.348" offset="12081319">Let me turn to the problem of justiciability which is here, because that was the fundamental matter on which the Master's decision rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.598" offset="12122384">The basic principles which this Court has laid down as to interstate litigation, themselves are at the root of the justiciability problem and I would like first to enumerate those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.937" offset="12175673">You've held in the first place that you will not take jurisdiction between States and I quote, "In the absence of absolute necessity."</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.432" offset="12213708">You have held second that you will not take jurisdiction and I again quote, "unless the threatened injury is clearly shown to be of serious magnitude and eminent."</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.785" offset="12259056">And finally, you have held that you prefer solutions by a Compact to solutions by litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.811" offset="12287164">Now, those principles weighed very heavily with the Master, because he felt that in deciding whether he should force the other States into the litigation, he must consider whether there was really any absolute necessity or any pressing an eminent danger which would warrant it and he decided very clearly that there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.299" offset="12377130">The absolute necessity test itself, if it does apply fully to join their parties, I think means this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.204" offset="12424777">That absolute necessity is a term which can only apply to indispensable parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.098" offset="12448392">Indispensable parties who are -- are those who are absolutely necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.974" offset="12467827">If this Court really means to adhere to the full meaning of what was said in the Alabama against Arizona case, if you mean to apply a rule of absolute necessity, then I take it you are deciding that you will not join states against their will unless they are indispensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.953" offset="12535745">And so said, it's conceded by everyone here that these Upper Basin States are not indispensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.785" offset="12555076">We therefore follow that the whole matter is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.640" offset="12570540">However, on the problem of justiciability, you have held that interstate litigation requires a case in controversy just as any other litigation would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.705" offset="12618815">And as to that, we have two California contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.008" offset="12631980">They are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.164" offset="12640653">First, California contends that the case to our controversy rule does not apply to the joinder of parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.486" offset="12669910">Their position and I quote from their brief is that "Once there is a controversy between a plaintiff and a defendant, "there is no further justiciability problem to consider on the joinder motion."</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.680" offset="12722678">Now, I submit, Your Honors, that this cannot be true that the doctrine of case in controversy applies to all of the parties in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.770" offset="12759040">I could pick no more familiar example, and for example, the case of United Public Workers against Mitchell, a case in which there were 12 plaintiffs and this Court with great care went over all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.273" offset="12805016">And finally, for variant reasons, struck 11 because there was no case or controversy and then proceeded to decide the case as to the 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.803" offset="12835109">Now, those principles, I think, are fully applicable here, and indeed, I pass the matter without further consideration because I cannot suppose that there is any very serious doubt, but that the case in controversy, principle does apply to the joinder of parties and to the additional party just as much as it applies to the bringing the suit in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.316" offset="12917238">We then reach the contention which is the alternative California contention, and that is that there is a case or controversy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.642" offset="12962482">And as to that, California takes this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.961" offset="12979827">They say and let me quote from their brief, "Despite the absence of a present breach of obligation, and despite the absence of a present physical invasion of a claimed right, California concludes that a quiet title suit by Arizona" and I'm still quoting "against the absent states alleging the identical title here asserted, would state a justiciable controversy within the constitutional power of this Court to decide."</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.619" offset="13098423">In short, California says, first, that they don't need to have a case or controversy, second, that if one is needed that if a quiet title, please notice they have, that if we had brought, acquired a title action against the Upper Basin States, it would lie despite the absence of any present breach of obligation and there is none and despite the absence of a present physical invasion complaining the rights."</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.757" offset="13203017">Now, Your Honors, we contend that that proposition is categorically wrong, and we of Arizona, we got to say are singularly well informed on this subject because we've been through it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.921" offset="13255680">In the first of our Arizona against California cases, way back in 1930, we did bring an action in which all of the States were joined and in which the United States was, as I recall it, also involved, alleging that the activities which were then going on in respect to the Colorado interfered with our rights in the river and this Court held, this Court held in an opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis and I quote, "that this contention cannot prevail because it is based not on any actual or threatened impairment of Arizona's rights, but upon an assumed potential invasion."</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.508" offset="13429969">Now, there, Your Honors, we think we come to the core up and this is what persuaded the Master, but an action of this sort will not lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.784" offset="13463092">There is no case or controversy on the basis of a merely assumed potential invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.547" offset="13490155">In this case, there is no controversy which we have with the Upper Basin States which is likely to come into an actually existing present controversy within the lifetime even of the youngest page behind that bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.999" offset="13551909">Under those circumstances, there is no actual threat, and in all of the cases, this Court has acquired that there be some kind of actual present threat before even acquired title action will lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.675" offset="13598616">And finally, the whole argument is suppositious because it began as I said with an “if”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.552" offset="13618155">If we had brought such an action, it would lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.796" offset="13627141">The answer is that we didn't bring such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.825" offset="13639262">We didn't bring such an action for a variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.438" offset="13649711">That is true that in the past cases, we had sued all the Upper Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.888" offset="13671549">But those were cases before we were under the Compact and now we're under the Compact which puts us into a division.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.648" offset="13694537">And now, we must live with it, and do our litigating with the only persons with whom we have any controversy and those are our immediate neighbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.229" offset="13736856">Let me add a word in conclusion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hatfield Chilson</label>
            <text syncTime="4344.251" offset="17376967">I'm speaking for all four of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.554" offset="17386162">Mr. Callister, Attorney General of Utah, Mr. Wilson, Special Assistant Attorney General of New Mexico, and Mr. George Guy, Attorney General of Wyoming, have asked me to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.505" offset="17450005">First, let me say that the Upper Basin States are most jealous of their water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.554" offset="17490129">Colorado in particular has evidenced that by much litigation in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.638" offset="17518550">If we felt that we had a real estate in this lawsuit, we would not have to be requested to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.406" offset="17553554">We would be clamoring to get in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.621" offset="17562436">I would like, if I can, briefly, to tell you why we think we have no state in this particular lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.957" offset="17603814">As it's been stated here, the Colorado River Compact did only one thing about division of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.025" offset="17635997">It divided water between the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.239" offset="17660865">It did not divide the water use within either basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.634" offset="17682495">So, when I speak of the Upper Basin share of the waters, I speak of the water use to which the Upper Basin is entitled under the Colorado River Compact, and when I speak of the Lower Basin share, I will be referring to the Lower Basin share of the waters under the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.715" offset="17766818">Now, as I said, the Compact made no division of water use within either basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.360" offset="17793358">The framers of the Compact left that as a future matter to be determined as an internal affair between each basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.546" offset="17826168">In 1948, the Upper States, following the spirit of the Compact, got together by agreement and made a division of the Upper Basin share among the Upper Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.786" offset="17903073">Now, at that time, the upper States faced essentially the same problems which the Lower Basin is now facing, because the Lower Basin has been unable to agree on a division of the Lower Basin share.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.892" offset="17963468">So, they have come into this Court and asked the Court to do by judicial decree, what the upper States did by agreement in the form of the Upper Colorado River Basin Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.861" offset="18027416">Therefore, the essential and only purpose of this action, if the Court please, is a division of the Lower Basin water use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.492" offset="18073913">It's not to determine how much water the Lower Basin is entitled to because that has already been determined by the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.515" offset="18118008">We have divided the pie by the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.814" offset="18127203">The Lower Basin has its share.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.503" offset="18137966">The Lower Basin States are now involved in trying to cut up their share among the Lower Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.997" offset="18171925">Now, the claims of the parties show that, I want to emphasize that, Arizona by its complaint is not claiming one drop of water out of the Colorado River System, except such as the Lower Basin is entitled under the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.640" offset="18258547">And then, her claim, she states that the waters to which she is entitled are subject to the availability of that water to the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.593" offset="18310269">Now, there -- they are attempting to divide it in specific amounts of acre feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.108" offset="18332421">The Upper Basin realized that the flow of any stream varies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.636" offset="18354469">The negotiators of the Compact thought they were dealing with 20,000,000 acre feet per annum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.379" offset="18373486">It now appears at least over a long period of time that the supply of the river is materially less, somewhere around 15,000,000, 16,000,000 acre feet perhaps.</text>

            <text syncTime="4712.442" offset="18849750">That is there the four principle contentions of California as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.146" offset="18872529">Now, the first is that this is an action on a contract that the contract is the Colorado River Compact, and that since we are parties to the Compact, therefore, we're necessary parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.319" offset="18925192">The second principle contention is not to avoid litigation in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.693" offset="18950687">This Court should anticipate the possible areas of conflict between the two basins and decide them on this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.241" offset="18996872">The third principle contention is that the determination of the issues which have to be determined to divide the Lower Basin share of the water are such that the Upper States' interest are affected and no effective decree can be entered without their presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.229" offset="19068865">And the fourth is that the claims of the United States require the presence of the Upper States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.429" offset="19097704">Now, let me refer first to this contention that this is an action on the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.175" offset="19124663">We most seriously contend that this is not an action on the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.161" offset="19144620">As I mentioned before, the Compact does one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.485" offset="19157891">It divides the water use of the river between the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.369" offset="19177430">It makes no division into our basin and that was by intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.733" offset="19206896">The negotiators of the Compact by intent limited this division between the two basins.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.001" offset="19235944">Therefore, this action to divide the Lower Basin water use is an action to determine a matter of side scope of the Compact, and therefore, it is not an action on the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.442" offset="19293727">And in such a division, whether it be on the Upper basin or the Lower Basin, the division of interbasin water use is an internal affair, which does not require the acquiescence or the presence of the States of the Upper Basins.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.821" offset="19355272">Now, that principle has been recognized on several occasions, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.530" offset="19374080">The first was -- it was recognized by the negotiators of the Compact, the Commission which -- which negotiated the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.143" offset="19420473">And I refer to the Hoover Dam documents which gave the history of the negotiation and we'll quote just briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.728" offset="19458821">Participants has stated that the negotiations would have broken up but for Mr. Hoover's proposal, that the Commission limit its efforts to a division of water between the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin leaving to each basin the future internal allocation of its share.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.991" offset="19539905">It was also the same principle that the States of one basin are not necessary parties to the division of water use within the other basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.466" offset="19577835">It was also recognized by the Congress and the Boulder Canyon Project Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.096" offset="19596330">By Section 4 (a) of that Act, they authorized Arizona, California and Nevada to enter into an agreement for the division of the Lower Basin share of the waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.830" offset="19651291">The Congress did not require the participation of the Upper States in that agreement or that the Upper States acquiesce therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.679" offset="19686713">The Congress treated it as an internal affair between those parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.576" offset="19710224">And it was recognized again in the negotiation and ratification of the Upper Colorado River Basin Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.964" offset="19739794">When the Congress consented to that Compact, they did not require that California and Arizona had to acquiesce therein or had to participate in the negotiations or had to ratify.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.946" offset="19795696">It was treated by everyone that it is an internal affair which they can take care between themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.757" offset="19834984">Now, less there be any misunderstanding, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.954" offset="19855778">I'd like to say right here that if the time should come that the Lower Basin States come into this Court and say the Lower Basin of the river is being deprived of water because the terms of the Upper Basin Compact are such and the operation under the Upper Basin Compact is such.</text>
            <text syncTime="4999.667" offset="19998616">That it is depriving us of water under the Colorado River Compact, the Upper States are going to have to face that issue and they're going to have to litigate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.289" offset="20033097">Now, I'll give the Court an example here shortly of what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.738" offset="20062877">It seems -- it seems fair to us therefore that this is not an action on the Compact, but it's an internal affair for each basin and that we're not necessary parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.088" offset="20108330">Now, I would like to turn to the second principal contention and that is that this Court should anticipate possible areas of conflict between the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin and to avoid suits in the future decide them in this particular litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.732" offset="20186906">Now, the Master found that there was no justiciable controversy between the Upper States and the parties to this cost, and that whatever the possibility of a future controversy may be, there exists no sound equitable reason for now joining the Upper States in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.579" offset="20266214">And we believe that the findings of the Master are justified because there is no allegation anywhere that the Upper States are exceeding their rights or evading their obligations under the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.163" offset="20332565">Now, the rights and obligations of the Upper States under the Compact are relatively simple and that the -- the principle right they have is to -- is the apportionment by Article III (a) in perpetuity to beneficially consume 7,500,000 acre feet of water per annum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.494" offset="20417933">Their principal obligations are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.084" offset="20432248">Under Article III (d), the Upper States are not to deplete the flow of the river below at Lee's Ferry, below 75,000,000 acre feet in each 10-year period.</text>

            <text syncTime="5796.122" offset="23184405">We have the same problems, so we -- we adopted a method of measurement of beneficial consumptive use by the Upper Basin Compact for the division of the Upper Basin water among the Upper Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.295" offset="23245113">Now, we don't contend that that is binding on the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.502" offset="23265907">They can use any method of measurement they wish to divide their Lower Basin water use.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.075" offset="23292238">Now, again, may I say, the time may come where it can't be soon because under any theory of method of measurement or consumptive use, they can't say that 2,500,000 out of 7,500,000 use, no matter how you measure it, but at some time in the future when the Upper Basin approaches its full utilization of its 7,500,000 acre-foot, the Lower Basin may come into this Court and say, “The method of measurement which the Upper Basin using is inaccurate.</text>

            <text syncTime="5932.957" offset="23731827">In the Upper Basin, we have over 8000, gentlemen, over 8000 separate diversions under all kinds of conditions, little vegetables that will arrogate a few acres, big vegetables arrogate a lot of acres in basin uses out of basin uses, 8000 and I defy anyone to find a method by which you can measure diversions less returns to the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="6041.118" offset="24164415">The Master found that the United States did not attempt to enlarge the scope of this action beyond its original purpose of dividing the Lower Basin water use.</text>
            <text syncTime="6055.425" offset="24221675">The petition for intervention nowhere asserts any claims for relief against the Upper Basin or the Upper Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.290" offset="24269113">Neither did the United States move for a joinder of the Upper States as being necessary for determination of the United States claims, and -- and I'll be frank.</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.211" offset="24320836">If the United States have joined, have moved to join the Upper States, we would have opposed that motion the same as we're opposing the motion for -- of California, and for a very good reason, the Untied States cannot play that the Upper States are depriving the United States of one drop of water use to which they're entitled in the Lower Basin, and we would oppose it for another good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="6107.878" offset="24431491">We, at all times, have acted in entire good faith for the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.130" offset="24452493">In the Upper Basin Compact, we included a provision which said that all uses of the United States, its instrumentalities and its words which included the ambiance that all those uses in the Upper Basin are to be charged against the share of the State in which the use is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.805" offset="24539220">The United States can use the entire 7,500,000 acre-foot of apportionment that the Upper Basin has and it will not affect the Lower Basin one I order, because it will be charged against the share of the State in which the use is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6155.404" offset="24621558">And so, the Upper -- the Lower Basin is now faced with the -- with the same problem of what to do with this United States claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="6167.801" offset="24671190">But why should we be embroiled in this litigation when we have taken care of the United States in the Upper Basin?</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.226" offset="24708807">And I would like to conclude, Your Honors, just for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.554" offset="24742139">The -- the Upper Basin, as I said, after the negotiation of the Compact, knew that they faced this problem of dividing among the States of the Upper Basin their share of the waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6203.567" offset="24814237">They did it by a negotiation around the compensate which -- and by an interstate compact, which I understand is considered preferable than to fight it out in Court.What I want to point out, it was not an easy task.</text>
            <text syncTime="6223.767" offset="24895007">As I mentioned before, the claims, the total claims of the States in the Upper Basin far exceeded the 7,500,000 acre feet that we have to divide.</text>

            <text syncTime="6252.904" offset="25011513">So, they divided it in percentages, but it was -- it was a tough job because when it came to the percentages, every State realized now that this was the last water hold that they had to go on from now and forever to take care of their future development in that area and that the only source was the Colorado River and so there was a fight by each of these States for as high percentages possible.</text>

            <label>Mr. Attorney General</label>
            <text syncTime="6847.370" offset="27389388">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6850.917" offset="27403598">I will try to be brief as the hour's late.</text>
            <text syncTime="6855.586" offset="27422302">In this brief concluding statement, I want first of all to say a personal word about the late George I. Haight, the Special Master to whom this Court confided the task of considering the motion made by California to enclave the Upper Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6872.936" offset="27491683">He was a member of the Illinois Bar and of the Bar of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6879.069" offset="27516238">His report on the motion is the crowning achievement of illustrious career.</text>
            <text syncTime="6884.284" offset="27537136">I hope this Court will sustain it in every particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="6889.878" offset="27559497">Now, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6891.725" offset="27566811">We've heard the arguments in this case by counsel on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="6898.910" offset="27595546">The law is pretty well set forth, but I would like to sum up those arguments and then to try it because I think that law is pretty well settle.</text>
            <text syncTime="6910.057" offset="27640163">It is settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="6911.869" offset="27647373">I would like to try to apply, if you please, the facts to that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6918.810" offset="27675167">Now, the -- the Master pointed out the object of the Colorado River Compact, and I don't think that we should forget the object of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6932.000" offset="27727935">What does Article I provides?</text>
            <text syncTime="6934.686" offset="27738697">The major purposes of this Compact are to provide for the equitable division and apportionment of the use of the waters of the Colorado River System to establish that relative importance of different beneficial uses of water, to move -- promote interstate committee, to remove causes of present and future controversies, and to secure the expeditious agricultural and industrial development of the Colorado River Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="6963.828" offset="27855308">The storage of its waters and the protection of life and property from frauds to these ends, the Colorado River Basin is divided into two basins, and one apportionment for the use of part of the water of the Colorado River is made to each of them with a provision that further equitable of apportions may be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6990.407" offset="27961574">It's true as it has been just stated that the Compact is one compact, but if the Court please, the division is definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="7002.739" offset="28010893">And this action is brought for the division of the waters, which, under this compact, belong to the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="7016.690" offset="28066691">Now, the proponents of this motion contend that the Upper Basin States should be brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="7024.933" offset="28099709">I submit that it has been thoroughly demonstrated that the Upper Basin States are not in defensible -- indispensable parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="7035.983" offset="28143909">I think it's pretty well proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="7038.547" offset="28154149">I think it's well proven that they are not necessary parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="7045.123" offset="28180480">And the courts have held from time to time in these cases that what is necessary, what is necessary to make a controversy, there must be a justiciable issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="7064.108" offset="28256340">And what does that sum up to?</text>
            <text syncTime="7067.467" offset="28269819">To have a justiciable issue, you must have an existing injury of serious magnitude or an immediate pertinent injury of the same time.What are the facts?</text>
            <text syncTime="7084.475" offset="28337842">It's just been stated by the counsel for the Upper Basin States when the present commitments are completed, their use will only amount to 2,500,000 acre feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="7099.045" offset="28396147">And then, if they are successful in getting their project adopted by the Congress, their -- their total beneficial use will be a maximum of 4,200,000 acre feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="7117.086" offset="28468245">There's no threat there.</text>
            <text syncTime="7119.925" offset="28479634">There's no enough danger of serious magnitude in these pleadings in any place or in this record as presented before the Master, and those are the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7136.824" offset="28547239">Now, what do the proponents seek to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="7141.351" offset="28565316">Well they would like to throw in here while we're going to have the interpretations that might affect the Upper Basin States wanted to the interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7152.331" offset="28609306">How do we know what the Upper Basin States will contend for 30 years from now while it's even been estimated that it might be as long as 75 or a hundred years from now before they would put the beneficial uses of 7,500,000 acre feet of water?</text>
            <text syncTime="7170.467" offset="28681822">What do we know about what the facts will be at that time?</text>
            <text syncTime="7174.021" offset="28696033">Will there be a serious threat then?Can we look into a crystal ball and say what the issues will be 25 or 30 years from now?I don't believe we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="7186.726" offset="28746815">I don't believe that this Court -- this Court has never attempted to do so in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="7195.494" offset="28781923">And -- and as has been held time after time, you can't speculate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7203.383" offset="28813479">If we were going to speculate, we might as well speculate that California, that the cause of this silting or this salting water, ocean water would be so reduced that California would much prefer to use ocean water rather than take it hundred -- out of the Colorado River waters -- river, out of its watershed hundreds of miles over to the coast or that they might develop the further river project.</text>
            <text syncTime="7238.579" offset="28954227">But we were not permitted to make such step -- such speculations, and I don't think it is appropriate to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="7248.058" offset="28992157">And as justice speculate here to say that the Upper Basin States will someday infringe upon the rights of the Lower Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7259.817" offset="29039177">Now, they talk about what the Federal Government has pleaded in this case in regard to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="7268.545" offset="29074077">They ask only for the use of the Lower Basin States water.</text>
            <text syncTime="7274.895" offset="29099572">They don't refer to the Upper Basin States water.</text>
            <text syncTime="7278.726" offset="29114828">The Upper Basin States have by their Compact taken care of their Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="7285.796" offset="29143144">And yet, the counsel here would ask this Court to speculate and say, "Well, no they -- they've got it in their Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="7293.166" offset="29172611">They're going to take care of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7295.084" offset="29180238">But they might not do it, so you better -- they better be dragged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="7300.073" offset="29200196">They'd better be fixed -- put to the expensive litigate, even though they've said in a solemn compact among themselves that they're going to do it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7309.874" offset="29239484">So, there's no issue and that's a reason why the Master in his will found against them in that regard, and we could go on here and take one by one and we find that all of their contentions are mere speculation that something might happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="7328.790" offset="29315135">No justiciable issues, no immediate threat of a serious injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="7338.928" offset="29355677">Now, if the Court please, in determining what might be the facts in the future, in determining -- in applying the facts to the law as we've heard it propounded here today, and as it is set forth in these briefs, let us look upon the other side of this case and figure just what might happen or what would happen rather, not what might but what would happen if these parties were brought in to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7377.936" offset="29511680">I would like to call to the Court's attention that to the -- to what Professor Moore said in three more on federal practice in the second edition at pages 2905, permit -- Professor Moore emphasizes that a belated motion to join will normally be overruled if the hearing of the case will be unduly delayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7411.103" offset="29644382">And then, we have other cases in regard to delays.</text>
            <text syncTime="7417.768" offset="29671027">One of them is in -- is in the federal court in 12 federal rules foresee -- rules, decision, 251, the Court said that third parties had joint tortfeasors would be proper or necessary parties defendant to such counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="7436.149" offset="29744588">In that case, however, their presence in the action can be ordered only at the discretion of the Court under Rule 20 and 21.Our discretion should be exercised in our position to the motion in view of the unreason delay likely to people precipitated by such joinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="7458.879" offset="29835494">The courts have held that bringing in States and litigation are serious matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="7465.575" offset="29862243">We had our plans in -- in the first Arizona case, but the Court said plans were not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="7473.048" offset="29892127">There was no immediate threat of diversion of water modern might never be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7478.947" offset="29915742">And then, in the Alabama versus -- versus Arizona case, the Court, which has been mentioned here which of course the Court has permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="7489.430" offset="29957642">The Court there said that you couldn't have declaratory judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="7493.632" offset="29974465">You must have -- you must have a justiciable issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="7504.544" offset="30018142">And the Court further said that the jurisdiction of this Court must not be exercised except on their absolute necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="7517.775" offset="30071014">Now, what is -- what are the facts applicable to this line of cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="7527.549" offset="30110093">Take the history of this briefly as has been outlined here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7532.613" offset="30130364">The record shows that Arizona, back in 1922, was a small state struggling to try to obtain some of the waters of the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="7546.208" offset="30184803">Yes, we tried three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="7548.200" offset="30192744">We knocked at this -- the doors of this Court three times and we made mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7557.013" offset="30227958">The Supreme Court told us so.</text>
            <text syncTime="7560.911" offset="30243631">Yes, we did, we did include the whole basin at the -- all of the Basin States at that time because we have not enjoined the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="7571.757" offset="30286994">We were not parties to the Compact, and we were in a different factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7579.560" offset="30318237">And then, after we've tried every method that we could as the record here will show and as alleged in our pleadings, we turned to the Secretary of the Interior and asked if the Secretary of the Interior wouldn't give us a contract for some water, and he gave us a contract for 2,000,000, some 2,800,000 acre feet unless a few uses which have been spoken of here upon the condition that we adopt the Compact, and that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="7615.746" offset="30462955">And so, then, we went to the Congress of the United States and -- and introduced what was known as a Central Arizona Project bill, and we had long hearings on that bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="7628.761" offset="30514991">And if the Court please, upon the last day of the first hearings in the Senate, by the first time the record will show, there was a resolution introduced in the Senate to provide for adjudication of these controversies directing and authorizing the Attorney General to bring such an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7654.795" offset="30619167">And that was used against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="7659.777" offset="30639020">That was used against us and -- and a similar resolution, those resolutions were broad and we've had theory of what the consequences might be on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7670.568" offset="30682175">And resolutions were entered and were -- were used in the Congresses in the Congress after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7678.207" offset="30712790">Until to -- so effectively, that as was pointed out by my colleague in this case, the House Judiciary Committee, the House (Inaudible) by a resolution told us that they would not further considerate -- consider this proper -- this project until their rights were adjudicated, and that left nothing for us to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="7705.624" offset="30822400">But here was our situation as the record will show, that the Federal Government owned the land all along the Colorado River.We had no way of getting water out of the Colorado River without causing that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="7723.270" offset="30893035">And so, we couldn't -- we couldn't present, we couldn't make a justiciable issue because we hadn't -- didn't have the means of taking water out of the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="7733.873" offset="30935458">So, we went to the Secretary of the Interior and he granted us a right way.</text>
            <text syncTime="7741.091" offset="30964297">And then, based upon what we expect to do in the State of Arizona, this action was brought and we have a price for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7752.098" offset="31008392">And we're going forward this Court for many years, because we have to have this water, because as the record show, we're already depleting our underground water supply to a dangerous point.</text>
            <text syncTime="7769.358" offset="31077355">And so, we come here and what is the situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="7774.372" offset="31097417">We find, again, even after all of the statements that were made in Congress that California is trying to bring in additional parties, which will again delay us.</text>
            <text syncTime="7792.871" offset="31171396">And if the Court please, will delay the Upper Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7797.994" offset="31191876">Now, I know that Mr. Ely or any of the counselor not bound by statements made in before a committee but they just show how the terms, what a term of controversy of this kind will make, how it will multiply, how it take years and years?</text>
            <text syncTime="7819.264" offset="31277035">You talk about it being narrow on the start and then you join new parties and you keep it going and going.</text>
            <text syncTime="7826.218" offset="31304829">He said, “We believe that the questions require to be presented to the Supreme Court in this matter all questions of law, interpretation of statutes, compacts, and documents of which the Court would take judicial notice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7840.202" offset="31360731">I'm not going to read all of their statements.</text>

            <text syncTime="7843.213" offset="31372852">I'm -- I'm reading from Mr. Ely's testimony before the Committee in the -- in the Congress of United States found in -- on House Joint Resolution 225, 226, 236 at page 4097 on May of 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="7863.089" offset="31452264">And then, he said, “We feel that the decision can be obtained within a reasonable time, within one or two years at the most.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7870.436" offset="31481731">And then, with another time because I don't consider this material to the facts of this case, I only read it because it showed how the delays that occur in these controversies and how the -- the issues, how they -- they shift from year to year.</text>
            <text syncTime="7887.553" offset="31550171">Then, in another time, he testified there is no -- no need to go further on disputes of problems requiring present disposition are believe to exist between the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="7900.377" offset="31601476">There's no need to determine the division of the water among the Upper Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7905.180" offset="31620702">They have, for nearly two years, been engaged in the negotiation of a Compact for that purpose and it is believed that this effort will be effectuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="7914.898" offset="31659572">They didn't think it was necessary then, that whether he went ahead and testified to that effect, other witnesses testified to the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7922.847" offset="31691337">And then, if the Court please, a year later, something like a year after they filed our answer in this case, they come in forth and for the first time, asked that the Upper Basin States be made parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="7941.758" offset="31766988">Now, what would be the result?</text>
            <text syncTime="7944.453" offset="31777750">As Mr. Ely said and as they testified then, there were three -- three things presented before the Congress of the United States and that they are in the same periods before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7957.732" offset="31830831">The question of who should stand the losses of evaporation but their Lower Basin evaporations understand, not Upper Basin evaporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7968.702" offset="31874717">The question has nothing to do with the Upper Basin States, and then, the question as to what is III (b) water.</text>
            <text syncTime="7978.655" offset="31914527">And I must differ with my good friend, Mr. Ely, in regard to the effect of the -- of this case, the second case by Arizona, the Court there held we contend that the substance of that holding was -- that that was apportioned water.</text>
            <text syncTime="7990.697" offset="31962697">The Court said, “But the Act does not purport to a portion among the States of the Lower Basin, the waters to which the Lower Basin is entitled under the contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="8013.175" offset="32052663">That it merely places limits on California's use of waters under Article III (a) and of surplus waters and it is such uses which are subject to the terms of said Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="8025.211" offset="32100833">There can be no claim that Article III (b) is relevant in defining surplus water under paragraph 4 (a) of the Act for both Arizona and California apparently considered the waters under Article III (b) as apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="8042.517" offset="32170005">And then, they go on and disposed that the -- and say now the Court says on the next page, “But the fact that they are solely -- solely useful to Arizona are the facts that they have been apportioned by -- by her does not contradict the -- the intent clearly expressed in paragraph (b) nor that the rational character thereon to apportion the 1,000,000 acre feet to the States of the Lower Basins and not specifically to Arizona alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="8076.360" offset="32305424">Now, if it please the Court, the Court was speaking then thus what they said about 3 (b) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="8083.387" offset="32333531">We contend this has already been litigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="8086.017" offset="32343980">We contend that most of these questions that are raised have already been litigated, but we couldn't convince the Congress of the United States if they hadn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="8095.408" offset="32381597">So, we have to come in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8098.386" offset="32393509">Now, three years have elapsed since -- since we first filed our petition for leave to amend to -- to file a petition in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8112.233" offset="32448888">Three years, the pleadings are already voluminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="8117.552" offset="32470204">They amount to four big volumes when you put them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="8122.698" offset="32490789">This Court grants this motion there will no doubt be other pleadings filed and if the same length of time is consumed, there'll be three more long years elapsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="8138.893" offset="32555572">Before we even get to the issue, the history of these cases shows that it takes some seven -- the 10 years or 12 years alot where there are only three parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="8155.648" offset="32622550">What will that be if you have seven parties and the -- and the Government of United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="8163.192" offset="32652748">It's not unthinkable to think for 15 years and then what will happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="8167.476" offset="32669884">Will a justiciable issue arise?</text>
            <text syncTime="8169.264" offset="32676989">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="8170.812" offset="32683154">The justiciable issues will probably go out the window, because Arizona's economy will be ruined by that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="8179.347" offset="32717322">We have our plans now.</text>
            <text syncTime="8180.746" offset="32722965">We want to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="8183.211" offset="32732787">What -- what's the result of -- of the situation on the Upper Basin States?</text>
            <text syncTime="8187.807" offset="32751177">They have their projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="8190.930" offset="32763716">The record shows in the pleadings shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="8192.931" offset="32771657">The brief show that they did go before the Congress and use this motion to oppose the -- to oppose -- to oppose this -- the granting of their Upper Basin project by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="8205.304" offset="32821185">And everyone knows that -- that -- the members of Congress are human beings.</text>
            <text syncTime="8210.669" offset="32842606">They're not very up to grant projects where suits are pinched.</text>
            <text syncTime="8214.766" offset="32859011">And so, if it pleases the Court, we contend -- pardon me if I have gone overtime --</text>

            <label>Mr. Northcutt Ely</label>
            <text syncTime="8306.288" offset="33225143">I shall be delighted to come in grips with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8309.379" offset="33237473">Here, Arizona sues to acquire a title to 2,800,000 acre feet of the waters of the mainstream under Article III (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="8318.123" offset="33272477">She alleges that California is entitled 4,400,000, about a 300,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="8323.679" offset="33294629">It is not a claim to a percentage of the common fund, whatever the common fund may be, but to acquire a title in fixed quantities in perpetuity so that as Governor McFarland has said, she may proceed to build a project that the cost of many hundreds of millions to use that fixed quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="8342.102" offset="33368398">We have built our projects, there are three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="8345.022" offset="33379997">Arizona alleges that we're using 4,500,000 acre feet, and that's approximately correct.They've built it to cost of hundreds and millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="8352.678" offset="33410612">Now, Arizona's claim is based upon the assumption that these three States having the aggregate fixed rights to the waters of the Colorado River System apportioned to the Lower Basin by Article III (a), aggregating 7,500,000 acre feet from the mainstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="8373.266" offset="33493055">We say that that is not correct that the Lower Basin has apportioned to it, 7,500,000 acre feet including the uses on the tributaries, particularly the Gila.</text>
            <text syncTime="8384.133" offset="33536522">Now, if the Court should hear a decree to Arizona, the fixed quantity and perpetuity of 2,800,000 acre feet based on the assumption that the common fund in the mainstream of 7,500,000 acre feet and the -- and the Upper Basin States are not bound by that, then that decree is based upon an illusion and a fallacy, a present mark because the Upper Basin has been recognized in the Colorado River Compact, know of treaty as having rights which are in conflict without assumption, namely, a right to use 7,500,000 acre feet, an obligation to deliver 75,000,000 every 10 years at Lee's Ferry, but that 75,000,000 is not the 7,500,000 common fund apportioned by Article III (a), that 75,000,000 includes water in discharge of the obligations to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="8435.599" offset="33742367">Consequently, as Justice Burton asked earlier, why are we concerned about where we considered about the position of the Upper Basin if they're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="8444.504" offset="33777998">We don't want to get caught between a decree in this case based upon the assumption that the common fund, the call of that, apportioned to the Lower Basin and available out of their main stream is 7,500,000 acre feet but in later litigation with the Upper Basin, it may be proved as we think it would be that the common fund which should have been divided in this decree is 5,500,000 or 6,500,000, the difference representing uses on the Gila River which are charged well plainly under the Compact to the apportionment made by Article III (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="8477.071" offset="33908193">In other words, we are thrust into collision with Arizona by the existence of the Colorado River Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="8484.612" offset="33938390">The rights of the Upper Basin and the obligation of the States of the Upper Division to the Lower Basin are the submerged foundation, the submerged portion of the iceberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="8495.693" offset="33982694">Arizona discloses here only heard contest with California and to some agree with Nevada, but that is not the cloud on her title.</text>
            <text syncTime="8504.064" offset="34016235">The cloud upon the 2,800,000 acre feet of mainstream water that she wants is the fact that the Compact -- the Compact of the Upper States does not give to the Lower Basin the common fund which she seeks here to divide up.</text>
            <text syncTime="8519.571" offset="34078198">It gives a lesser quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="8521.527" offset="34086034">Consequently, the conflict is -- is imminent.</text>
            <text syncTime="8524.497" offset="34097946">It is here because the decree here cannot divide 7,500,000 acre feet of III (a) water from the mainstream for the Lower Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="8531.912" offset="34127621">It isn't there under the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="8534.320" offset="34137234">The Upper Basin doesn't owe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="8536.482" offset="34145907">If they're not bound by the decree, the decree attempting to divide the larger quantity is wholly an illusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="8543.306" offset="34173179">They are necessary to a decree that effectively disposes of this present controversy in the Lower Basin, not because we wish to enlarge the issues to bring new issues to bear against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="8556.139" offset="34224483">We feel we're under no compulsion to state a cause of action against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="8559.765" offset="34239007">If one is stated against thus by Arizona, it's only because the Colorado River Compact exist, because it withdraws some circulation, takes for the Upper Basin, the consumptive use of 7,500,000 acre feet and limits their obligation to 75,000,000 acre feet at Lee's Ferry which includes Mexico not just as Lower Basin States.</text>
            <text syncTime="8586.207" offset="34344751">Mr. Chilson property -- pardon me.</text>
            <text syncTime="8589.050" offset="34356140">Mr. Chilson properly pointed out that the Upper Basin Compact is on a percentage basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="8608.094" offset="34432313">Let me clarify the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="8610.159" offset="34440568">The Colorado River Compact in Article VIII provides that present perfected rights are unimpaired by this Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="8617.645" offset="34470557">We alleged that we have present perfected rights as the day -- as of the date the Compact became effective in 1929 to 4,950,000 acre feet per year, all the appropriation, some dating to 1877, some to 1891, projects built and using water at that time, that is 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="8638.811" offset="34555193">Arizona admits that our present perfected rights, the hardcore, the hard rock that the Compact cannot touch or at least 3,000,000 acre feet or thereabouts based upon her depletion theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="8651.310" offset="34605140">Consequently, a percentage division of the common fund in the Lower Basin and from the mainstream, if such were finally arrived at and it might be on the merits, Your Honor, after the trial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="8664.895" offset="34659579">It may be that there will be some sort of percentage division, but it must take into account the present perfected rights in both States.</text>
            <text syncTime="8672.684" offset="34690717">Arizona alleges that she only -- or only claims present perfected rights for some 75,000 acres under the Compact, perhaps 400,000 or 500,000 acre feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="8683.053" offset="34732199">Powers must be protected that the Compact has to begin in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="8686.612" offset="34746410">You cannot assume that what we are contending for here is a pro rata division that Arizona is here to get 2875ths of the common fund in the mainstream, that's not it.She is here to get 2,800,000 acre feet quite different perpetuity, but if she were here to get -- pardon.</text>
