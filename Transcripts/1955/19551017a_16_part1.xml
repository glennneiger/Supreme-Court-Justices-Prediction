            <text syncTime="21.762" offset="87040">Your Honors, this case arises from a criminal prosecution for driving under the influence of liquor where blood was extracted by the police to determine the alcoholic content.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.231" offset="144823">The defendant was found guilty by a jury in his second trial where he was permitted a trial by jury and then petitioned to the appellate department of the Superior Court of the State Of California being the court of the last resort under the laws of California in misdemeanor prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.328" offset="217234">The appellate department affirms the conviction and having no further remedy, a petition for certiorari was filed and granted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.083" offset="260284">The issue presented by this case Your Honors is whether the involuntary extraction of petitioner's blood by the state police to determine sobriety and the use of the results of such a blood test as evidence against the petitioner are a violation of the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.909" offset="331546">The privilege against unreasonable search and seizures or -- and the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.887" offset="359445">A further issue has been raised in respondent's brief and that is does the allocation of the preliminary questions of fact between the judge and jury violates the due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.391" offset="601548">The officers testified that he had accelerated his automobile to a speed of 60 or 65 miles per hour.The petitioner testified that he was traveling approximately 40 miles an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.238" offset="644911">After stopping him and witnessing him walk, the officers took him to San Jose approximately 18 miles away to the Accident Prevention Bureau and there he was asked to perform certain balance and coordination tests which he declined to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.081" offset="716278">He also was asked certain questions on a form provided by the District Attorney's Office for interrogation by officers of suspected drunk drivers and he declined to answer those questions with the words “No comment.”</text>

            <text syncTime="200.857" offset="803422">Now, the officer testified that he had declined to take the blood test several times when that was requested of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.561" offset="850233">The technician testified that he had declined to take the test at least two times.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.081" offset="876251">The petitioner testified that he continued to refuse to submit to the blood test and that he expressed a protest to it at the time that it was taken from him against his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.471" offset="937796">The officer of the State Highway Patrol testified that the time of taking the blood test, that the petitioner requested that a doctor or a lawyer -- that he be permitted to consult a doctor or a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.603" offset="990354">And the officer testified that this was refused him.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.904" offset="1007595">The officers testified, however, that he did express after refusing these number of times that he did say, well then go ahead and take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.815" offset="1059213">The petitioner however has testified that he never did consent to it and continued to protest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.816" offset="4907259">And as he stated himself in the record, that at the point when the blood was to be taken from his veins, the only thing left for him to do was to resort to resistance of a physical nature and that he thought that the only thing -- that that would -- and that would aggravate the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.250" offset="4984999">Just as with coerced confession cases, the coercion is not alone confined to violence and brutality but also other less violent and brutal circumstances have been held to cause a confession not to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.722" offset="5062844">Now, in this situation where we have an analogy as was brought out in the Rochin case with the coerced confessions where you have the extraction of real evidence, you have a somewhat different situation in this respect that the length of time is not particularly or necessarily a factor in that when once over the protest and against the will of the petitioner, the police attempt to take the blood from his veins, he is faced with three alternatives at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.825" offset="5195233">It is not the question of how great the coercion is or how -- over how long a period of time it goes in order to see if the pressure was so great that he no longer could resist the coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.277" offset="5241104">But at that point regardless of the amount of time, he must determine whether he is to submit and just continue orally to protest or whether he is to resort to physical resistance and thereby bring -- in a sense bring himself within the Rochin doctrine if the officers themselves go on with further restraint to extract the blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.912" offset="5339638">Otherwise, he is -- he is -- and for that reason we submit that the -- that a -- an extraction from the body of blood is a violation of due process when taken against his will and over his protest irrespective of the degree of force used to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="5326.931" offset="21307664">But nevertheless, if I may proceed to answer some of the questions that have been raised, some of the justices at court, I think it will become evident that question -- federal question was raised below, and that Rochin -- whatever the checklist of brutalities that this Court sought fit to write into it is still available to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5369.215" offset="21476833">Now, first, question was raised by a number of the justices and Mr. Justice Reed, the first one who asked about it, as to whether or not the involuntariness of the matter was raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="5392.579" offset="21570247">And Mr. Attorney General's answer to or attempted answer to the fact that we don't know what the trial judge considered in the matter in excluding or rather in receiving that evidence is no answer because the counsel below, Mr. DiMaria, was permitted to argue to the jury, the question of involuntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.662" offset="21714547">Now if, as the Attorney General says to Your Honors, I don't know what persuaded the judge below in receiving the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="5507.811" offset="22031151">It is brutal and shocking conduct in the part of officers to inject a needle into a person and withdraw blood.</text>

            <text syncTime="5541.032" offset="22164062">And Mr. DiMaria goes on to say, now, there is another thing, the question may come up as to whether it was taken against his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.593" offset="22198335">Testimony is without contradiction that right after the blood test, Mr. Walton was belligerent not cooperative.</text>
