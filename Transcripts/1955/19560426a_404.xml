            <text syncTime="74.485" offset="297900">It is a pleasure to be back here again and to find the Solicitor General and I still on the same side.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.557" offset="326217">This is a suit to enjoin the collection of a property tax by the County of Sarpy in Nebraska against imposed upon a housing project built for military tenants and a military reservation subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.103" offset="396330">The taxpayer or petitioner here is a private company which has leased the land and buildings from the United States for a period of 75 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.401" offset="437603">It is our contention in this case that this tax is invalid because it is imposed upon territory which is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States and that Congress has not waived the immunity from state taxation of that territory for this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.730" offset="506880">And secondly, if the Court should disagree as to that, the only statute which conceivably permits taxation with respect to this project is the one authorizing taxation of the lessee's interest and this tax here was not imposed upon any lessee's interest but on the property itself which belongs to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.867" offset="595383">The -- the project was directed under the Wherry Military Housing Act of 1949.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.304" offset="685140">Because the uncontradicted evidence is that the -- they assessed their tax to that -- I can tell you what they mean, I -- I shouldn't have said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.273" offset="721084">The -- that their opinion as a whole means that they interpret the whole factual language as putting the ownership of these buildings in the petitioner and therefore, they say it is proper to tax the petitioners, lessee -- the lessee, the petitioner as owner of -- of the -- of the -- of the buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.274" offset="805094">And they have to come to that result, Your Honor, in order to sustain the tax because the only Nebraska statute, they sight which would sustain this tax just -- was set forth at page 37 of our brief says, a lot of taxation of this such property to the owner and therefore -- and that's the premise of their decision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert L. Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="317.576" offset="1270282">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.066" offset="1272163">I will explain -- I will explain all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.433" offset="1289718">This statute resulted from the fact that housing conditions that are military reservations in 1949 and in some extent still were deplorable and that house -- and that military personnel who wish to have their families with them were forced to live under very bad conditions and pay exorbitant rents for housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.735" offset="1366936">As they -- in order to meet this, to meet the laws of personnel which resulted to the -- to the military force which resulted from this and there was testimony before the Congress that this was the -- the greatest reason for losing military personnel in adequate housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.951" offset="1431719">This -- the FHA authority was expanded under the statute to permit it to ensure housing to be built on or adjacent to these reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.628" offset="1478426">When the Secretary of the Defense of the Air Force or whatever it might be certified that there was a need.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.491" offset="1509878">The statute also authorized the leasing of Government land for the construction of this project and this was done for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.308" offset="1541224">The first was that land owned by the United States often was the only land close enough and suitable enough for use to fill this demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.006" offset="1571944">And the other reason according to the Committee Reports was that that would enable the land to be obtained at nominal cost so that the rents to the military subtenants would be lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.402" offset="1609561">The object of course was to provide them with housing at a low cost that was feasible, when this case arises on the Offutt Airbase, the headquarters of the strategic Air Command near Omaha, Nebraska and area subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.606" offset="1678420">The project was -- the land was leased to the petitioner for 75 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.733" offset="1698900">A nominal rent was charged in order to keep the cost down, a rent with $100 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.601" offset="1726380">The lease provided that the buildings belong to the United States as I've said and I have more to say about that later.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.726" offset="1754802">The buildings were completed and occupied by 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.815" offset="1771207">Now, there are many Government -- governmental controls left over this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.038" offset="1788134">This wasn't just a lease of land to somebody and then he's left alone to do what he wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.466" offset="1809763">The Government assumes demand financial risk by assuming the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.829" offset="1827213">It limited the amount which could be invested for apartment unit and in the interest rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.793" offset="1851141">More importantly, it determines and controls the maximum rentals.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.299" offset="1869113">And the record shows that the rentals were established on the assumption that no property tax would be imposed and if they were the rentals would be raised upward to the military personnel, so they would have to pay for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.556" offset="1918224">The -- not only does the Government determine what the rent shall be or the maximum rent, it determine who may live in the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.520" offset="1942047">They've got to -- we've got to let live in the project whatever military employees that commander tells us.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.504" offset="1969946">The lease controls the length of subleases so as to make sure that military tenants can get out after a year on a month-to-month basis or if they're transferred or if their service is terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.694" offset="2018743">The lease can't be assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.234" offset="2024908">Government controls standard and maintenance to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.267" offset="2037029">The property can't be remodeled without the -- or changed any substantial way without Government approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.313" offset="2069211">And the commander's rules with respect to safety and so forth, the commander of the airbase, they must be observed by the petitioner or lessee here.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.924" offset="2103693">Now, the record also shows that the Federal Government or petitioner provides the main governmental services to the land upon which this project is built.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.326" offset="2141205">The Air Force itself provides fire and police protection, sewage, water service are connected with the Air Force main.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.883" offset="2179448">Roads on the project are built by the petitioner and the access roads are built by the Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.068" offset="2200242">A number of these services, the petitioner pay the Air Force for or the tenants directly or indirectly pay for it through the rent or directly to utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.053" offset="2244127">This case doesn't involve school taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.661" offset="2254576">The area is not in a school district and the reason is that the Federal Government under another statute finances the schooling for the people who have on this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.048" offset="2292088">So, the main governmental services which cost money are not provided by Sarpy County.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.027" offset="2316016">And this refutes respondent's argument, if I may anticipate a little, that it's unfair not to have local taxes paid by this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.748" offset="2346945">On the contrary, the equities are all the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.104" offset="2360320">Since the county doesn't provide these services and the Federal Government or petitioner do, it would unfair to charge them, to make them pay taxes to what they don't get.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.428" offset="2397623">And particularly, since the tenants have to pay for a lot of these services as I've said once directly to the Federal Government or to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.444" offset="2429701">Now, as I've also said no return was filed by the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.364" offset="2449450">The assessor filled out a return in which he placed, said what he thought the value of the buildings was, he didn't say anything about the lessee's interest and the case was brought in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.432" offset="2493649">The District Court for Sarpy County and what I think and not merely because it went our way, is an excellent, of oral opinion which is found in the appendix to our petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.393" offset="2537535">He held that the tax was imposed on the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.666" offset="2550596">There was no attempt to attack the lessee's interest that the buildings were the property of the United States that the lessee's in the statute couldn't possibly be applicable and he expressed in his opinion some doubt as to whether it would be anyhow and that therefore, the tax was void.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.955" offset="2615798">Nebraska Supreme Court reversed primarily on the ground, as I read its opinion, that the interest of the United States in this property was a purely paper interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.332" offset="2649234">The United States didn't really own the property and that therefore, the tax could be justified as a tax in the lessee's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.075" offset="2680268">In the first question, I want to touch because it sort of underlie the theory of the decision below is, the question as to whether the United States or the petitioner owns the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.989" offset="2719869">Because that was the premise upon which the decision below rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.409" offset="2733558">Now, the usual rule as this Court doubtless knows is that the lessor owns buildings constructed on leased land though that again is subject to the intention of the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="771.443" offset="3085688">I think if you put all that together, you come out with the conclusion, it might not be economical for a businessman to do so but the building could last longer than 75 years and we all know that Government buildings often do last longer than they're suppose to, from our experience in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.273" offset="3164996">Now, in the court below respondent admitted that under the term, as I read their briefs, under the terms of the lease, the Government was the owner of the building, they purported to be the owner of the building, but they said that this was a sham and a fraud for the reason that I've indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.797" offset="3227167">Well, if it is a sham or a fraud, it isn't -- it isn't the fraud or our client because these was all done in a Government's form lease but we think it obvious that there wasn't any sham or fraud to it even if the purpose of shaping the contract in this way was to evade or not to evade but to avoid local taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.086" offset="3304281">That, we think, is immaterial under the decision of this Court in the Kern-Limerick case in 347 U.S. often title is determined by contracts, by the form of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.150" offset="3352555">And if property rights are to be determined by contract, the contract is controlling and nonetheless so because Government lawyers, like other lawyers perhaps contracts with an awareness of these problems and with a purpose to do what they think will be in the best interest of their client.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.050" offset="3424131">But we think the -- apart from the mere language of the contract in order to show that that language should be disregarded or the other side, this county here must sustain the burden of proving that the Government's interest is less than that of an ordinary lessor who conceivably has an interest in the -- in property and its interest has never regarded a sham or fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.323" offset="3517231">Here on the contrary, it's easy to see, I think, from the facts which I've outlined that the Government's interest in this property is greater than that of the ordinary lessor -- lessor because the ordinary lessee isn't restricted the way that lessee of this project is by the lessor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1527.327" offset="6109205">But the appliance is only a very small part of this case and I think I've summarized my argument on that and probably won't come back to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.820" offset="6139193">Now, the first -- the first argument, Your Honor, which has to -- which covers the point of lessee's interest as well as anything else, is that this cannot -- this tax cannot be sustained because Congress has not consented to taxing -- to this tax on lands subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.444" offset="6217770">It's established that States and counties cannot tax even private property on areas over which the United States has exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.344" offset="6253296">In the Surplus Trading case in 281 U.S. there were blankets own by a private company on a military reservation, exclusive, and this Court held that the State couldn't impose a property tax on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.302" offset="6297182">That case has been -- and others before and since have sustained that principle and there hasn't been any deviation from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.055" offset="6324140">The -- some of those case involved lease property, Arlington Hotel against Fant, there was a lease for 50 years of -- of land on a reservation for 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.754" offset="6363011">It was held the State had no authority over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.923" offset="6371683">For the fact that the lease doesn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.594" offset="6382341">Now, Congress, of course, may waive the federal immunity from taxation and it is done so in a number statutes which used expressed language saying that on federal areas, certain kind of taxes or other laws may be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.133" offset="6444513">Most important here is the Buck Act of 1940 which permits the States to impose sales, used, income and gasoline taxes on these areas in expressed language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.093" offset="6492369">But it doesn't allow him to impose property taxes on this areas, just the main kind of taxes and it does so very expressly which shows that when Congress want to this, it knows how to do it expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.307" offset="6533224">Now, there is, of course, special reason why Congress should have to be quite expressed in waiving an immunity of this sort and that is because people and States and the Federal Government shouldn't have to guess as to where the jurisdiction lies over -- over particular territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.047" offset="6604173">That policy was embodied in an Act 1940, involved in a case before this court, Adams against United States in which it was pointed out the need for definiteness in accepting jurisdiction by the Federal Government over these areas and is just as much need for -- need for definiteness in -- in losing or waiving jurisdiction as there is in accepting it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.919" offset="7023595">Now, let's turn to the statutes, Your Honor, and I submit -- and the question here we're considering is whether Congress has waived the immunity from exemption of property on a federal -- exclusive federal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.471" offset="7065809">And I submit that no one reading the Wherry Act, would ever suspect that it contained any such waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.231" offset="7092872">There isn't any such expressed language in at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.418" offset="7105620">The only legislative history which even refers to the question of taxability is a small colloquy in the committee hearings, set forth on page 24 of our brief, in which a Congressman said, if they were bill off the reservation, the housings would be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.491" offset="7169881">Nobody contradicted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.802" offset="7179180">The administrator was there and I think that shows that people, if -- if they thought that was too narrow, they would have said, "Well, even if it's on the reservation, it could be taxable," but nobody said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.469" offset="7213871">So, the only specific mention to -- of it in the whole history of this bill is the statement -- if it's off the reservation, it can be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.499" offset="7245949">So, let's turn, however, to sections of the statute which maybe regarded as pertinent but first, I want to refer to which is the only Section which has anything to do with taxation at all quoted in page 25 of our brief, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.600" offset="7298299">Section 80 -- no, 25 and 24, Section 807 and that provides that nothing in this title shall be construed to exempt any real property acquired and held by the Commissioner," that's the FHA from local taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.972" offset="7367784">Now, let's look at that again, "Nothing in this title shall be construed to exempt."</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.682" offset="7390668">This mean, this title shan't exempt and the reason for that provision, that was put in to standard provision in FH -- various titles of the FHA, so as to mean that if the FHA takes over property under fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.386" offset="7441450">That property won't go off to tax growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.024" offset="7452003">So, the purpose of that was to -- was to make it clear that the property which was otherwise taxable wouldn't become nontaxable because the FHA acquired it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.007" offset="7499964">The -- the court below conceded that this section isn't applicable here because the FHA haven't acquired this property, the Commission hasn't acquired it but even more significantly, this section is significant for what it says and for what it doesn't say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.087" offset="7556284">It only expresses an intention, as I've said that property which is taxable otherwise shall stay taxable on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.686" offset="7586691">It doesn't mean or provide that property which never was taxable because on exclusive federal enclave will become taxable under this statute and that -- if I may -- that if I may say so, I think, there's a theme underlying my -- this portion of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.516" offset="7653982">The intention was, as I see it that if the land next door, just like this land is taxable as it would be or off to reservation then the project should be taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.378" offset="7697450">If the land next door, 50 feet away isn't taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.746" offset="7710929">If the building next door wouldn't be taxable because it's exempt, then this project shouldn't be taxable and I think that make sense and I think that's what Congress really had in mind, although there isn't very much to talk about it as -- as I have indicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.950" offset="7995768">The first part of it at least is pretty long that's the most relevant part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.419" offset="8013636">Whenever the secretary determines that it is desirable to lease real property within the meaning of the Act of 1947, and I'll skip a little, the Secretary is authorized to lease such property under authority of said Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.174" offset="8072673">That's the Act of 1947, upon such terms and conditions and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.187" offset="8092735">Now, there -- there again nobody reading that which anything in it about taxation or -- or any intention to waive -- to waive the -- the federal immunity but let's go back then to the 1947 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.062" offset="8160235">Under the 1947 Act which is set forth in the next -- beginning on page 65, a little further on, defines Section 1 of that statute is the section which authorizes the secretary to lease real and personal property under certain conditions which are the same conditions referred to in the 1949 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.097" offset="8240379">Now, that Section 1 is authorizing section of the 1947 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.793" offset="8259082">There's no question that section is incorporated by reference, if you want to call that, in the 1949 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.882" offset="8283429">But our position is that that section which is the authorizing section is the only part of the 1947 Act which is taken over to the 1949 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.127" offset="8320418">That's all Congress was thinking about when they said, under the authority of said Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.971" offset="8339853">Now, if you look the next four sections of the 1947 Act, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the next couple of pages, near the back of our appendix, don't have anything to do with these subjects who obviously, they could have been incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.079" offset="8392307">So, the whole case from the other sides point of view comes down to whether the first section of sentence of -- first sentence of Section 6 which is at the bottom of page 68, the last page of our appendix was incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.448" offset="8441731">And that sentence says, that's where the lessee's interest comes in Your Honor, it says, "The lessee's interest made or created pursuant to the revisions of this Act shall be made subject to State or local taxation."</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.082" offset="8496274">Our first -- our position on that is that that was not intended to be taken over under the very general language of the 1949 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.294" offset="8529084">No one in the 1949 Act said anything about immunity from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.823" offset="8551236">The only language is under the authority of that Act and we don't think that's expressed enough and it was expressed enough indication of congressional intention to be a waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.022" offset="8588016">There was a good reason for not carrying -- for Congress not understanding that it was carrying this provision over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.685" offset="8610691">If you look at the difference and purposes of the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.983" offset="8623856">The 1947 Act was the statute for -- for leasing surplus factory facilities to private industry when they couldn't be used by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.795" offset="8663144">It has -- it has to be a finding that the land is of no -- that the plants are of no use to the Government at that present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.012" offset="8688013">And if that so -- of course there's good reason why the lessee at -- we should -- in them should be taxed that this leased a private business for non-governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.836" offset="8723331">Here the purpose was just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.931" offset="8731690">Congress is providing for the leasing of land only because there was a current governmental need for military housing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2315.836" offset="9263334">And here, as I shall show or maybe I have shown about the tax was imposed in the buildings and the buildings of the Government's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.796" offset="9299174">So even -- my -- my second argument, Your Honor as I've said it, even if this is applicable, they haven't come -- come within it because they didn't tax the lessee -- they tax the Government's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.335" offset="9349329">Well, one more observation on Section 6 before I try to do draw this to a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.488" offset="9381930">The history of Section 6 itself shows, in our opinion, that it wasn't intended to apply to exclusive federal enclaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.235" offset="9416934">Without going into detail orally because that's a little difficult, it shows that it was thought by the framers that lessee's interest of what was involved in the 1947 Act, the appliance, the factories could be taxed anyhow by States which permitted them to be taxed and it is common law and is common law of this Court that lessee's interest generally can be tax if they are in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.420" offset="9521633">So, in the Committee which this provision was drafted, some people said, "Well, you don't need something in the statute to allow taxation of this," and others said, "Well, it won't do any harm to put it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.720" offset="9562802">It'll be the substance, it'll be declaratory anyhow."</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.833" offset="9575236">So, they put it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.503" offset="9581923">Now, that full discussion doesn't make sense at all if they were talking about exclusive federal areas because in exclusive federal areas, States can't tax lessee's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.253" offset="9616927">They must have been talking on the -- on the -- basing this or writing on the assumption they're talking about lands which could be taxed otherwise and that wouldn't be an exclusive federal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.114" offset="9660395">Well, now let's look at the -- theirs is -- for that reason, we think that Section 6 itself doesn't apply to such areas, that it wasn't intended to be incorporated in the 1949 Act, anyhow but that statute isn't specific enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.916" offset="9723611">But let's look at the a anomalous consequences which would result if the other conclusion is reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.093" offset="9752346">On a military base like this, right next door, hundred yards away, in this although this isn't in the record, this isn't a fictitious example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.703" offset="9786723">There could be Government owned apartment houses with appliances owned by private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.329" offset="9813264">There could be a Government owned building with a private contractor and owning his own machinery and that actually is the case to some extent right on this project, a hundred yards away from these apartments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.072" offset="9860284">This privately owned machinery, the privately owned appliances couldn't be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.166" offset="9884630">Right on the land this project is on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.775" offset="9895079">The tenants owned their own property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.815" offset="9907200">The utility companies owned their own property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.397" offset="9917544">They can't be taxed, they are not lessee's interest of any sort, they're just private property on a Government reservation, just like that, just as if they were located 50 yards away of course across right outside of the leased land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.846" offset="9967282">They couldn't be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.379" offset="9973447">It certainly would be strange for Congress to intend that Government leased -- property of the Government could be taxed or property leased from the Government could be tax when property, which is privately owned or leased from a private person right next door couldn't be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.951" offset="10043768">That just doesn't make sense and I don't think that statute should be construed so as to reach that result.</text>

            <text syncTime="2535.377" offset="10141466">That's considered in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.795" offset="10151079">In conclusion on this point therefore, we believe that in order to avoid this anomaly and in order to reach the result which I think is the one which -- which provides a standard which should be applied in these cases that this project should be tax just like the land next door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.348" offset="10233313">It should be tax if the fellow next door can be taxed and it shouldn't be taxed if the fellow next door can't taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.475" offset="10253897">And here the fellow the next door couldn't be taxed, its unexclusive federal enclave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.122" offset="10272392">In order to avoid the unjust result, whereby this county collects taxes for services which it doesn't provide where they're provided mainly by the Federal Government, this tax cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.768" offset="10318994">And I add that the District Court for Sarpy County said they wouldn't be any lost to Sarpy County if that result will reach because this property had never been on the tax growth of Sarpy County.</text>

            <text syncTime="2676.372" offset="10705398">In the Allegheny County case, there was a lease by the Government of machinery to a private Company and the Allegheny County there taxed the full value of the machinery leased by the Government to the private company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.405" offset="10769554">This Court held that that was tax on the Government's own -- Government own machinery and was void, couldn't stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2709.962" offset="10839771">But the Court said nobody has tried to tax the leasehold interest.</text>
