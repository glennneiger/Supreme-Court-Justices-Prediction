            <text syncTime="16.203" offset="64784">I represent in this case Mr. Earl P. Greenwood, who is the petitioner here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to review a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.357" offset="129358">The Eighth Circuit reviewed and affirmed an order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri which was entered on July 30th, 1954, committing your petitioner to the custody of the Attorney General of the United States upon certain terms and conditions which will be referred to in detail later.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.923" offset="227683">I was appointed by the Court, District Court in Kansas City by Judge Ridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.945" offset="247745">The Greenwood had no funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.914" offset="263628">He has now been in the federal custody for over three years and he is insane and incompetent and still is unable to stand trial on the charges pending against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.144" offset="336562">Briefly, the questions before this Court, the first question is whether or not the provisions of Sections 4244 and 4246, 4247 and 4248 of Title 18 of the United States Code which are set out in detail in the appendix to both of the briefs whether or not these provisions provide for the continued confinement of an accused charged with a federal crime who has found to be, we'll say, permanently insane so that it is not likely that he will be able to stand trial on the charges against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.583" offset="506253">In other words, if those are the circumstances, do these sections, properly interpreted, provide for the continued commitment of such an accused by the federal government?</text>
            <text syncTime="140.168" offset="560588">The second question is if these do -- these sections under these circumstances do provide for the continued commitment of such a person, are they unconstitutional as violating the Tenth Amendment reserving to the State's powers not delegated to the Federal Government or is petitioner perhaps being deprived of his liberty without due process of law?</text>

            <text syncTime="230.396" offset="921496">And then the final question is the question of whether or not a finding which was made in this case that the petitioner will probably endanger the safety of the officers, the property or other interest of the United States is supported by substantial evidence and whether or not such a condition or finding is the proper basis for the continued confinement of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.156" offset="1028598">Now, the facts are that in November of 1952, Greenwood was arrested under an indictment charging him with the armed robbery of a federal post office in Kansas City, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.306" offset="1085127">He was arrested in November of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.050" offset="1096098">The alleged crime was committed on October the 22nd of 1952, less than a month or approximately a month before his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.604" offset="1134341">Greenwood was then transferred to the southern -- the Eastern Division of the Southern District -- I believe maybe the Northern District of Ohio under Rule 20 and when he came up before this Ohio District Court, a question arose as to his mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.465" offset="1221799">And in December of 1952, he was examined by a psychiatrist in Cleveland, Ohio and this was only two months after the crime was allegedly committed and then that psychiatrist examined him the following month in January of 1953 and found him to be incompetent, unable to understand proceedings against him, at least unable to properly assist his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.372" offset="1329424">So the United States District Judge there in Cleveland, Ohio then referred the -- the case back to the Court in Kansas City, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.024" offset="1376026">At that time, then approximately in February of 1953, the matter came up before Judge Reeves and he was then informed of the background of petitioner's mental disturbances at least what had happened and what had been found by the Court in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.166" offset="1448647">And petitioner was then committed to the -- at least sent to the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.998" offset="1487935">That's where he is now and that's where he has been really for almost three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.255" offset="1508937">He was committed there by the Court for observation as to his mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.792" offset="1539135">His condition is of course important to the understanding of this case and therefore I just like to refer briefly to the various reports which were made by the neuropsychiatric staff there of the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.909" offset="1619592">The first report was made, it's in page 64 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.086" offset="1640281">As to the final conclusions, the Court came to the conclusion that the petitioner was suffering from schizophrenia as an acute and undifferentiated type.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.315" offset="1701198">He was unable properly to choose between right and wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.426" offset="1713633">He was motivated by insane delusions and that he was unable to properly understand the nature of the charges against him and to cooperate with counsel in his defense, a long history there is given in connection with that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.162" offset="1784581">And then it appears exactly why the Greenwood was at the medical center for such a continued length of time is not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.081" offset="1824287">But at any rate, our next report is in January of 1954, a report of the neuropsychiatric staff on page 65 of the record in which they agreed that the patient remain psychotic and incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.830" offset="1895236">They agree that the patient's illness was chronic, of longstanding and the -- the prognosis for recovery was poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.546" offset="1926165">The staff recommended that the committing court be advised that our finding indicates that it is unlikely that this subject will regain his sanity in the near future.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.390" offset="1969528">The staff recommended consideration to transferring the subject to the -- a state hospital in the State of his residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.569" offset="1998263">His residence has been Cleveland, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.344" offset="2009339">I don't think there is any dispute here that that is the State of Greenwood's residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.968" offset="2027833">He was born there.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.070" offset="2032222">He still has a family there.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.433" offset="2049672">After this report was made, there was another matter came up before the Court thereon February 1st, 1954 -- February 2nd and then order was made by Judge Ridge there at that time found on page 12 of the record in which it referred to the report of the staff that I have just read in which the Court made the statement substantially that it was now determined that the defendant is so mentally defective that he will probably never be able to stand trial on the charges pending against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.571" offset="2214243">The Court suggested further opinion be secured from the staff at Springfield as to whether or not the conditions which will be discussed later set forth in Section 4247 of Title 18 of the Code existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.585" offset="2290312">Those conditions of whether or not the accused is -- might -- will probably endanger the safety of the property, officers or other interests of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.506" offset="2337959">And the Court suggested a further proceeding at that time might be had with reference to a finding as to those conditions, but in the meantime and pursuant to the suggestion of the Court which was in the final paragraph of the opinion, the Court suggested that perhaps Greenwood could be transferred to a hospital or to the proper authorities in the State of his residence having in mind that his mental condition was such that he would likely not be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.318" offset="2457182">And so pursuant to that suggestion, the federal authorities did release Greenwood to the authorities in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.308" offset="2501172">That occurred approximately in May of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.726" offset="2518831">Unfortunately, the record is not as clear as we would like to have it as to just what transpired in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.998" offset="2547984">However, it is -- it is clear that he came up before the probate court there, that he was in the receiving hospital there at Cleveland, Ohio, that one psychiatrist examined him and apparently thought that he was sane.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.936" offset="2615693">At any rate it is clear that the Ohio authorities, and that thereafter he had come before the probate court, concluded that it was safe at least to release him.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.845" offset="2671282">And so he was released and as soon as he was released, he was arrested by the federal authorities, returned to Kansas City, Missouri and it was at that time that I was appointed to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.469" offset="2729796">The Court suggested that a hearing should be held under Section 4244 to determine Greenwood's competency to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.819" offset="2771174">Two psychiatrists were appointed by the Court, Greenwood was referred back to Springfield, Missouri for further examination by the psychiatrist and on July 30th -- or rather July 15, 1954, there was a hearing with reference to the mental competency of the petitioner to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.467" offset="2865842">The two psychiatrists appointed by the Court, who had only examined Greenwood approximately an hour, concluded that he was sane in their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.927" offset="2907638">But Dr. Smith, who was the Chief of the Neuropsychiatric Staff at Springfield, whose staff had just examined him, who had observed him some 15 or 16 months while he was at Springfield, testified that the petitioner was still insane, he was incompetent and the opinions of the staff from time to time that I had been referred to were -- were admitted in evidence and it was the unanimous opinion of that staff that at that time, which was in July of 1954, that petitioner was insane and couldn't stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.370" offset="3061447">And so the Court made the order of July 30th, 1954, which is the order that is appealed from and it is the order which is set forth on page 17 to 18 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.387" offset="3133544">The Court found that petitioner was insane and mentally incompetent to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.627" offset="3162488">The Court further found that if released he would -- will probably or would probably endanger the safety of the officers, property or other interests of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.796" offset="3215151">The Court found that suitable arrangements were not available for the care and custody of Greenwood other than by commitment to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.072" offset="3256216">These findings are findings which are set out in Section 4247 of the statute in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.554" offset="3290175">Based upon those findings, Greenwood was committed to the custody of the Attorney General either until his mental competency is restored or until it is improved to such an extent that he will not endanger the safety of the officers, the property or other interests of the United States or until suitable arrangements are made -- are available in the State of his residence for his care and custody at least that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.970" offset="4535798">In this connection, we would like to refer to the case of Wells versus Attorney General which is a Court of Appeals case for the Tenth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1150.584" offset="4602253">Now, in this case, an accused who was insane was committed pursuant to the provisions of Section 4246 until he was -- the charges against him were disposed off according to law or until the -- his condition improved so that he could be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.913" offset="4683651">And he filed a petition for habeas corpus in which he contended that he was permanently insane or was likely that he would never be tried that he was therefore being held possibly for life for the sole reason that his mental condition was such that he -- he couldn't stand trial and therefore that the right of the -- of the Federal Government to continue to imprison him ceased when it appeared unlikely that they could ever try him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.800" offset="4811128">And that matter came up before the Tenth Circuit and the Court was of the opinion that the petition for habeas corpus should be granted, that the care of the insane, that the custody of those that are mentally ill is a power which has not been delegated to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.432" offset="4889704">It is a power which has been reserved to the States and that when it appeared that a person would not likely be tried then it was up to the United States to release him because the reason for detaining him no longer existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.249" offset="4964937">And the Court was of the opinion that the statute should not be construed to provide for the continued detention of such a person who was suffering from such a mental illness and the statute was therefore so construed, the -- the Court referred to the capacity of the States in their character as parens patriae in caring for those that were ill.</text>
