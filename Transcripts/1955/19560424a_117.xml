            <text syncTime="21.274" offset="85055">At the adjournment yesterday, I had presented the facts relating to the issue of whether through routes were already in existence between the so-called excluded or northwest territory and via Ogden in the Rio Grande to points in the eastern and southern parts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.196" offset="172722">To summarize those facts very briefly, Union Pacific does not offer through transportation with Rio Grande on the traffic here involved, admittedly, by publishing with Rio Grande only prohibitively higher combination rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.356" offset="249417">Union Pacific seeks to preserve its own long-haul on this traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.152" offset="272509">Substantial war time and emergency routings of traffic have been made via Rio Grande, Ogden and Union Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.138" offset="308454">In addition, a trickle of commercial shipments, totaling 55 and they're represented at the year 1948, have passed over Rio Grande via Ogden and the Union Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.330" offset="365296">The opposing views on this issue within the Commission, I submit, pinpoint this difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.204" offset="396748">Is it enough that a through route exist in a technical sense and that a shipper who is willing to pay the higher combination rate may specify the alleged through route and that connecting carriers will comply with such a shipper's routing instruction and issue a through bill of lading?</text>
            <text syncTime="122.970" offset="491833">Or must there be a proof that a through route exist in a realistic commercial sense in that the connecting carriers affirmatively hold themselves out as providing through transportation over the particular route or in the sense that shippers make a substantial use of the alleged through route?</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.233" offset="8364931">These intransit privileges are available in practically all railroads including both Rio Grande and Union Pacific but as a practical matter, shippers can afford to use this intransit privileges on a particular carrier's line only if after reprocessing or freezing, as the case may be, the commodities can be reshipped on the balance of joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.214" offset="8476839">Similar of these commodities can be reconsigned while on route as buyers and markets are found, only through reconsignment -- only through rerouting can be done at joint rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2146.566" offset="8586240">On the other hand, there are good grazing areas in Utah and Colorado in the areas served by the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.485" offset="8621871">Livestock is fattened in those feeding and grazing areas and reshipped to other parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.302" offset="8649143">If livestock is moved from the excluded area for feeding in area served only by Rio Grande in Utah and Colorado, that livestock, after feeding, can be reshipped to points beyond the Rio Grande's lines only if the combination rates which are substantially higher than would be the balance of joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.417" offset="8733571">The result is to deprive livestock growers in the excluded territory of the market for their livestock represented by the feeding lots in Utah and Colorado served only by the Rio Grande and it deprives the feeders served only by the Rio Grande of access to the feeding stock produced in the northwest area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.614" offset="8834403">A similar situation exists with respect to fresh fruits and vegetables which are grown in substantial volume either in Idaho, Washington and Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.368" offset="8881424">There exist on the Rio Grande, a point served only by the Rio Grande, numerous processors, dealers in such commodities but if they buy fruits and vegetables, potatoes, produced in the excluded territory for processing, packing and so on, on the Rio Grande that can -- they cannot ship such commodities after processing in transit to points beyond the Rio Grande except at the higher combination rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.799" offset="8995109">And in the case of the fruits and vegetables, potatoes, there's still a further factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.307" offset="9033143">Those commodities are frequently shipped, put on cars and started moving generally toward the east at a time when -- when a -- before a buyer has been obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.807" offset="9095210">So that the right to reconsign as buyers are found or as a buyer has lost and another buyer is found is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.202" offset="9132722">Those reconsignment privileges exist on practically all railroads including Union Pacific and Rio Grande, but the reconsignment privileges are practically unavailable unless they can be exercised on through rates and on a balance of -- on joint rates or on a balance of joint rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.861" offset="9211402">For example, if an Idaho shipper routes a carload of potatoes under -- via Rio Grande and while on Rio Grande he finds a buyer at a point beyond -- beyond Rio Grande's lines, he can reroute only at the higher combination rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.143" offset="9300532">That means that he will probably, in most instances, have to sell the potatoes at a sacrificed price rather an attempt to reconsign them or reroute them at the combination rates, that's called a pocket market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.142" offset="9368555">In the case of the same shipper, for example, these ships bound to Oklahoma on -- on a through route by Union Pacific and then wants to reroute into the southeastern part of United States as he finds a buyer, he can do so only at the higher combination rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.339" offset="9461342">That's because the Union Pacific and shipments coming out of the northwest territory will allow through routes to the north -- to destinations in the southeast or in the shipments that utilize Union Pacific long-haul to either Omaha or Kansas City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.886" offset="9535530">The shipment ends up down here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.589" offset="9546292">If the Idaho shipper wants to reconsign the points to the southeast, he can do so only at the higher combination rates, whereas to such a shipper, the entire southwest area is a pocket market.</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.461" offset="12765832">The Rio Grande had an unquestioned right under the statutes to resort to the Interstate Commerce Commission and asked for a decision upon this allegation that through routes were in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.349" offset="12821316">Not that they were to be established under 15 (4).</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.776" offset="12867082">Now, there were two prongs to that, not one but two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.113" offset="12888398">First of all, that through routes had been established and competitive joint rates had been established admittedly when we were operating in relation with the Oregon Short Line and the (Inaudible)</text>

            <text syncTime="3293.262" offset="13173029">We are met in this case by the statement that because there was a higher rate, the routes were commercially (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.529" offset="13222034">Now, I submit that this Court has settled that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.806" offset="13243141">In the Great Northern case and in the Virginia case and another cases that the formula, and that's how simple it is and the Union Pacific's defense that the mere possession of a higher rate automatically close the through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.804" offset="13319210">Of course the commercial deterrent kept the shipments down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.771" offset="13334988">The wonder is we had 55 cars in the typical year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.168" offset="13356617">We only use the typical year 48.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.454" offset="13365812">The wonder is that there were enough shippers willing to pay that higher rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.350" offset="13389322">It wouldn't have been much longer if we'd only had 10 cars.Now, on these government shipments, there's a point there to be cleared up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.389" offset="13429551">Yes, these shipments were under service orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.875" offset="13451494">What a service order merely compels the carrier to take the shipment, it doesn't compel it to settle that competitive joint rates which the Union Pacific did on those shipments and they were perfectly willing it took no compulsion when 19,000 cars were shifted from Western Pacific, it's one of our allied lines in southern and they took them over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.887" offset="13551491">They took them over on a through route basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.996" offset="13563925">In other words, required to take them but they weren't required to take them on a through route basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.535" offset="13586077">And if there was no through route then if you look at Section 15 (4), you'll find that the Commission has the power in any emergency if there is no through route to establish a temporary through route for that emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.327" offset="13661205">And so, the Commission itself recognized when it merely enter -- issued a service order that the through routes were there unavailable and could be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.639" offset="13710524">Now, that's one form of it, I say, and we might stand on that alone and not be compelled to show any shipments at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.385" offset="13753469">What the other form is this question of user and of holding out and we're told that it's not realistic because the Union Pacific never went out or actively solicited traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.152" offset="13828598">Does anyone suppose down here, where we have through routes, why user's consent that the Union Pacific ever goes above the prospective costumers in that area and urge -- assumed to ship over the Rio Grande?</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.293" offset="13909159">You don't have to have active solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.447" offset="13921698">What is a holding out?</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.820" offset="13931207">As we stated in our brief, the merchant on the street who has his door open for business is holding out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.059" offset="13972167">He doesn't need to go out into the street and urge costumers to come in to his shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.993" offset="14003931">A holding out is merely being open for business on a certain basis and the Union Pacific and all its trade officers have been open for business on a through route basis and never have they refused to issue a through bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.965" offset="14075820">Now, may I clear up another matter?</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.442" offset="14097763">Mr. Justice Harlan has been interested in this question of 2011 and Mr. Collins said, as I understood him, that under 2011, a railroad is compelled to issue a through bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.356" offset="14169339">On -- of you return to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.158" offset="14180624">At page 47, our opening brief, you'll find this section is discussed and I think carefully, 2011 requires -- and that's basically a section so that the shipper will have a receipt and he can sue for damages, for negligence and other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.006" offset="14271948">And so, the section does provide that a common carrier must give a receipt or a bill of lading but it does not say through bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.569" offset="14314266">And Justice -- Mr. Ginnane very frankly admitted a railroad may decline to which the through bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.625" offset="14358465">Now, in 48 is the Section you were reaching for, if I may say so, Section 6 (1) which empowers railroads, in fact, requires railroad to publish these tariffs and it distinguishes, as you see on page 48 of our brief, it says that they must publish the tariffs and they may show when a through route and joint rates have been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.057" offset="14484167">If no joint rate or through route has been established if no joint rates or through if it has been of service to several carriers on such through route so (Inaudible) and keep open for the public inspection as aforesaid and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.433" offset="14525649">So as Mr. Hickey indicated in his brief and he's much a much abler commerce lawyer than I pretend to be, Mr. Hickey in his little brief for the American Short Line Railroad Association has fully explained, I believe, this whole situation of how a railroad, by filing a tariff if it wants to also cancel the through routes may do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.520" offset="14634005">If it does then some shipper and interested party may come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.470" offset="14661799">Now, it has been said here that this is a question of fact, this question of the existence of through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.837" offset="14715298">Yes, it's a question of fact as to whether through routes were ever established there and compared to the joint rate, but I submit to you as this case reached the Colorado court, it was not a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.584" offset="14774335">It was strictly a question of law because there was no disagreement at all on the basic fact, and I don't think it will -- quite true to say if I may say so that there must have been something in the nature of a motion here, Mr. Justice Reed, where a decision was reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.778" offset="14859076">We were entitled to a decision on that question, not if it was merely an administrative matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.560" offset="14890214">What if the facts were undisputed?</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.085" offset="14900245">This Court has always considered it a question of law and it's so admitted in the Union Pacific's brief or we considered it a question of law as to whether through routes are in existence or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.114" offset="14956356">And that brings us to the Thompson case and I want to finish on that note.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.414" offset="14977567">In the Thompson case, there were no through routes of any kind and no shipments had ever gone forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.128" offset="15012467">There was no background that the through route ever having been established or a competitive to a greater existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3777.467" offset="15109851">And whatever result comes from this litigation, if I may say so, whether Rio Grande prevails or Union Pacific, I think it is important for this Court to clarify the Thompson case and make a claim so that no Commission again divide by its class on this important issue, I think.</text>

            <text syncTime="3821.785" offset="15287066">I'd like to suggest first of all that this -- all this talk about whether or not through routes and joint rates were in existence by the Rio Grande is wasted, if it ever amounted to this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.195" offset="15344744">It became moot when the Commission knocked that off the ground in a way by saying that the routes are necessary in the public interest, but next to what extent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.064" offset="15408170">To the extent that joint rates are necessary on particular a commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.419" offset="15437636">They have as to whether or not through routes existed has been played up by the Rio Grande in an effort to get this case back to the Commission and get a fresh start and see if they can -- better -- better order than they've had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.074" offset="15492284">The Commission said the rates -- the routes are needed, of course, they can brush a short-haul prohibition aside just for the use of the words then they could say as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.675" offset="15546619">The next step, to what extent are the -- they wouldn't argue and come to discover on everything -- every commodity in tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.907" offset="15579533">They said they'll need it on these commodities, the perishable commodities because we think that perishable commodities need every possible route thus going far beyond in the statutory (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.925" offset="15635644">Then as I said, the Court yesterday, they reached out and brought in dried beans and livestock under that tent and then that not being enough brought in the westbound tombstone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.564" offset="15706175">Now, may I say to the Court that their effort to the efforts of counsel for the Rio Grande suggest that there's confusion in the Thompson case is futile so far as this case is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.067" offset="15776183">Thompson made it definitely clear that the publication by each -- each railroad that connects it with the next one of its local joint rate did not result in the establishment of through routes and we get upon the point Mr. Justice Frankfurter was touching awhile ago that if that would be so then the through routes power given to the Commission in 1906, 19 years after the original Act required the publication of local rates by each carrier, is all a futile gesture and unnecessary surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.570" offset="15942217">And the idea that the Union Pacific, by not making some note in its tariff or tariffs, saying that the route is close as I have said to you yesterday and I point to discussion in page -- of the railroads brief in number 333, the Colorado case, page 76.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.476" offset="16065829">I've cited cases there which said -- say that we can't put any kind of a -- of a wording in a tariff, it will -- will prevent us from carrying out a statutory duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.445" offset="16117760">They might as well say that we'll publish another so we won't pay our income tax because the duty is just as binding on us to act as a common carrier, to accept shipments when they're offered at whatever rate is published.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.877" offset="16167497">We're compelled to publish rates and to accept shipments and all of these -- these pathetic talk about our having never put a roadblock or torn up the tracks or having published the futile note in the tariffs saying the route is closed is without the -- the slightest substance and nothing but an effort to get this case back to the Commission to take a fresh start for seven more years of this onerous litigation.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="4428.799" offset="17715096">Yesterday, I asked you about the question of adequacy and what the language of the Commission was in finding that the facilities of the Union Pacific were adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.062" offset="17760235">And you referred me to that portion of the report of the Commission which is entitled, "Opposition Testimony" in which it said its present facilities are adequate to move over its own direct routes, the present volume of traffic in any additional volume that may be anticipated in the foreseeable future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.069" offset="17848216">Now, today, Mr. Holman points out to us, under the heading “General Discussion and Ultimate Fact Findings,” the following language, "While the true service over defendant's routes in general is as satisfactory to the shipping public as the service which could be provided over routes including the Rio Grande via Ogden or Salt Lake City, this is not true with respect to the commodities we have enumerated."</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.954" offset="17959811">Then jumping to the latter sentence of that same paragraph, it says, "On such traffic, the defendant's routes are inadequate unless economical and are the Rio Grande routes."</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.014" offset="18007980">Now, would you explain the difference between those two and which is binding on us -- binding on us insofar as the question of adequacy is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="4520.852" offset="18083318">Now, they say first that the Union Pacific routes can make it in at least 24 hours shorter time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.742" offset="18122919">For traffic, this traffic moves, mind you, from the Northwest to Atlantic City in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.208" offset="18144758">The question is getting it from the west origin to the east in termini.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.067" offset="18168268">And yet they say it is not true that we can do all that, haul perishable goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.450" offset="18197734">And why can't we?</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.633" offset="18202436">They don't explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.290" offset="18209123">They don't tell us why we can't haul perishable goods that's passed or pass at the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.937" offset="18231693">They tell us that perishable goods need a lot of transit services, after telling us in the first place that they must travel with expedition and care.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.009" offset="18275997">Then they tell us that they must stop for periods which under the tariff could be as long as 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.035" offset="18304104">(Inaudible) privilege is what puts the Commission itself in this case and this Court wants in the decision in 305 U.S.by Mr. Justice Reed, that is a commercial operation and not a transit -- not a transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.351" offset="18369306">So, then next they say, the shippers in the Northwest, who now have the Union Pacific routes and a few of whom, 20 -- 22 of whom as against 73, the Commission says are debarred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.541" offset="18430119">The 73 denies that they're debarred and they denied that they want the long routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.589" offset="18450286">They say they are satisfied but the Commission says you were debarred no matter what you say from these markets in the country because you can't ship over the Rio Grande at the same rate you can over the Union Pacific Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.426" offset="18509636">They each testified that they reached every market in the country in the all 48 States -- I -- I beg your pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.573" offset="18538266">They say we -- we ship our goods to every State in the 48 States and to six foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.176" offset="18572643">Now, that came both from Rio Grande witnesses and witnesses that uphold the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.192" offset="18600751">I -- I say to you, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Commission has -- has so obviously, to me in that paragraph, contradicted itself that I see no way to reconcile the -- the statements in it.And if the Union Pacific routes are inadequate because we don't serve points that might want to go through a commercial operation called transit located along the Rio Grande then we are sunk indeed and so is the rail -- the railroad in the country.</text>
