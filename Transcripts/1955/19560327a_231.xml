            <label>Mr. Roger P. Marquis</label>
            <text syncTime="18.078" offset="72307">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.703" offset="86727">Our position is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.807" offset="99161">First, we think the actions taken here were appropriate in enforcement of law regulating the grazing area of the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.656" offset="154540">Second, we think that assuming that that is not so, assuming some defect is found in the procedures or a mistake as to the law applicable that that cannot be the basis of a judgment in the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.481" offset="237923">I don't think I need separately deal with the matter of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.003" offset="259971">I think so far as necessary, that will come out in the course of my discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.081" offset="284317">I think that the matter of damages is dealt with adequately in the briefs and I don't think that is necessary to be dealt upon during my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.397" offset="337502">First of all, and I think as the Court of Appeals held, we were plainly right, A, in applying the Utah abandoned horse law to the Taylor Grazing Act area and, B, in the procedures and so forth that were taken under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.377" offset="433424">And I will have to leave to the briefs on the record the dealing with the details of that for the most part.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.094" offset="460278">Now first, and this is the matter which is quite important in the administration of the Taylor Grazing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.340" offset="493296">It is the question, “Did the Taylor Grazing Act supersede the state law and in particular in this case, the state law as to abandoned horses?”</text>
            <text syncTime="137.215" offset="548780">A three-minute summary of the situation when the Taylor Grazing Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.575" offset="570201">I don't think we need be reminded the importance of the public domain in the west to the livestock and cattle and sheep industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.981" offset="607922">In the State of Utah, for example, 70% of the land is still public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.417" offset="633626">And that 70% -- the 30% that is privately or state owned is interspersed sections like school lands, 16s and 36s or the homesteads or small areas and the public domain runs through the entire area and it's a checkerboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.921" offset="707605">For the most part, in this grazing area, the springs, the wells, the pass, the lowland where there's some cultivation, will be under a patent and the attached grazing area of wide scope will be public domain subject to grazing licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.289" offset="789107">Because of the very great importance of the grazing matter to the west, special laws had been built up special rules of law modifying the common law as to trespass and as to such matters in order to deal with the situation of an unfenced area of public domain of large importance to the local industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.664" offset="906553">And of course, that is the source and has been the cause of dispute between cattle men and sheep men and had related in particular laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.073" offset="952216">And of these, the abandoned horse law deals with a public health and public welfare problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.365" offset="981368">It's the problem of abandoned -- is perhaps a misnomer in our eastern sense of someone abandoning their -- of their personal property like an automobile or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.584" offset="1038315">It's a matter of dealing with uncontrolled animals running loose on the unfenced public lands, the range of the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.351" offset="1077394">The problem is that there may be owners, there very likely is for all of them, but there has to be an enforced control of some sort dealing with the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.214" offset="1136849">And we have to keep in mind the vast areas in the small population and the policing problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.686" offset="1162658">For example, San Juan County, Utah which is District Number 9 on the Taylor Grazing Act is 7800 square miles, somewhat larger than the State of Massachusetts, it's one of the largest counties in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.639" offset="1250534">The particular area which I will come to in a minute where these eight Indian families claim the rights is of itself 760,000 acres, larger than the State of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.381" offset="1333499">The population of San Juan County is roughly 5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.096" offset="1356382">These give a picture, of course, their vegetation is sparse so that there has to be large areas for grazing and we're dealing here with widely dispersed people and animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.810" offset="1427226">Now, this abandoned horse law and I might say that it is not peculiar to Utah, Wyoming and Montana, for example, have laws that are identical to the Utah law on this subject, set out a procedure whereby the menace and it's a menace to the existing animals on the range, the menace of mixed breeding and the animals running loose are likely to be the lower quality animals or those things the matter of horses running loose on the range is a menace.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.636" offset="1562540">It's a public house problem, public welfare problem, a public health problem to these areas in the west to which their grazing is so vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.887" offset="1611546">It's far beyond simply the forage that the horse may eat.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.012" offset="1627951">Well, that is a problem enough, all the dislocations caused by uncontrolled horses.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.031" offset="1660029">That is the particular program we're dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.694" offset="1682704">And other programs, you look in the statutes of the western states, you look under livestock or animals, you will see a gradient quantity of legislation dealing with these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.090" offset="1740278">Now, up until 1934, these western states had all enacted that legislation dealing with the public range which was most of the range, and the matter of the rights to graze had been governed by custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.346" offset="1805375">No special federal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.121" offset="2716421">And this impoundment law, the local impoundment law, had been invoked by the white permittees who were entitled to own -- to graze the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.745" offset="2754978">And as the record will show, that is one of these episodes when the county sheriff was there enforcing the local impoundment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.772" offset="2787056">The abandoned horse law is something entirely different for a different purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.773" offset="2807014">Its purpose is to rid the range of these uncontrolled animals running loose.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.912" offset="2839615">And the procedure there is to pick up the animals and when they know a roundup is coming, then the -- as I say, the owners file the descriptions and the brands.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.093" offset="2888307">And, for example, in this case, there were many horses running loose, there are as many as 400 horses running loose on the range.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.976" offset="2927804">The Indian horses were some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.853" offset="2943373">It wasn't known to which Indians they belong of these eight families.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.494" offset="2965943">They were all running loose on the range and the notice was given in accordance with the statute that there would be a roundup of the horses.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.465" offset="3001783">And as might be expected when the notice was given, “We're going to have a roundup,” and they go out and they start looking at the range, most of the horses had disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.529" offset="3058103">I think that is perfectly in accord, first, getting back to what I was dealing with, I think it's perfectly in accord with the Taylor Grazing Act which preserve local police power and which preserve in its very first section of the Taylor Grazing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.025" offset="3128007">It said that the jurisdiction of state courts -- of states is not to be affected except so far as necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.213" offset="3156846">On the top of page 69, at the end of Section 1, it starts on the very bottom of 68, the appendix of the Government's brief, “Nothing in this Act shall be construed in any way to diminish, restrict, or impair any right which is heretofore may hereafter initiated under existing law validly affecting the public lands and so forth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="810.128" offset="3240438">And then it comes down to about the fourth line, “Nor as limiting or restricting the power or authority of any state as to matters within its jurisdiction.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2989.358" offset="11957394">C, the Board of Commissioners of San Juan County, Utah, two of them testified and the Secretary of the Board testified and their testimony was rejected in part on the ground that it was all part of this conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.249" offset="12024895">Next, the Advisory Board under the Taylor Grazing Act, which provides for a local advisory board to advise the local managers on operation and enforcement of the Taylor Grazing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.298" offset="12077140">And finally, the white grazers who had permits to operate on this land and had been the plaintiffs in the state court circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.650" offset="12110576">We say the answer -- and that flows through the entire picture of the case that you can pick out and view one or the other of these matters because of the view of the -- that that exist -- that plot or scheme was existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.972" offset="12175882">And we say that is simply not so because of one primary fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.881" offset="12199497">The assumption of all that matter of plot or conspiracy is that the federal officers and the local officers were attempting to oust these Indians from the area without giving them a chance to litigate their alleged rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.612" offset="12274416">Now, the fact is that I think the statute, it's very unusual, Congress had said in creating the extension of the reservation right next door to this area and most of the Indians had moved into the Aneth Extension in 1933 when it was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.397" offset="12341499">Congress had gone to unusual lengths in saying that there shall not be lapping over on to adjacent area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.476" offset="12385802">And it had said that con -- it had provided contrary to usual law that no further allotments to lands to Indians on the public domain shall be made in San Juan County, Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.330" offset="12433241">And it had provided that the Indian Homestead Act of 1884 which gives Indians a right to obtain homesteads without charge on public domain should not apply to San Juan County, Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.797" offset="12491128">That it -- very clearly limited the Indian, the Navajo Indians to the Aneth Extension and to the Navajo reservation, that that is the view that has been taken throughout by the Government, that that was expressly passed on by the local county court of San Juan County and then the state court -- Supreme Court of San Juan County, Utah in a decision that is clearly correct and that the fallacy all the way through here is simply ignoring the existence of that fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.676" offset="13074704">And in their reply brief, the petitioners in this Court quote certain excerpts along with that part, but the very -- those two sentences that they leave out where the Court is talking about alleged violation of its order and it's going to issue a temporary restraining order, he's talking about injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.692" offset="13274697">The fact is that one of these episodes which is described in the finding, the episode of the handcuffing of the Indian women, the finding doesn't mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.070" offset="13316180">The man who put the handcuffs on was the local county sheriff of San Juan County, Utah acting under the state impoundment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.227" offset="13352856">We say that that is typical of this whole case that the fact is that as Congress had made so clear and as the Supreme Court of Utah had held expressly dealing with these subjects that the Indians were not entitled, this group of six families were not entitled to graze upon this area that they were obliged, they should go to the reservation and remain there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.870" offset="13471451">That the issuance of licenses on the Taylor Grazing Act to the white grazers was perfectly valid and that they had the rights in the area.</text>

            <text syncTime="3702.957" offset="14811742">I can't pass wholly unchallenged the statement however immaterial in this case, bearing on its perspectives that Congress has sanctioned and insisted that these Indians move back to the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.402" offset="14873600">That simply isn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.386" offset="14885512">I ask you to bear in mind the finding of the Court that these Indians dwelt here peaceably and the record shows that they did up until Kinneman came in 1946 as range manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.766" offset="14939011">And in 1947, their permits were canceled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.089" offset="14952281">The record shows they were cancelled because they were given seven months permits and they wouldn't go to the reservation for five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.942" offset="14987703">There's not a blade of grass on that reservation as if the Commissions of the District of Columbia ordered my wife and myself to move in the apartment of our next door neighbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.580" offset="15038276">They're very nice people and I think we're reasonably nice people, but it simply wouldn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.898" offset="15059592">There is no room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.113" offset="15068369">That is the backdrop of drama behind this case in which the alleged plot, the proven plot or collaboration between the local ranchers, the county officials, taking in Kinneman and his crowd completely have moved in to insist that these people be driven back the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.926" offset="15175680">There is no power to order them to the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.942" offset="15187696">They were bona fide settlers, recognized conclusively as such by this very bureau itself, by the issuing -- issuance of permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.368" offset="15221447">Those permits could never have been issued if they were not in some way entitled to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.424" offset="15241613">That's a long subject of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.547" offset="15250181">I know that and title is not in this case, but I couldn't pass on -- without notice of those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.326" offset="15285290">And as you look at the record, you will notice the great difficulty that the Court had in getting the files, getting the records in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.836" offset="15327295">At page 393, the Court asked who where the permittees here and there was great reluctance to give him the permittees and they never did get in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.144" offset="15364493">They finally got a stipulated statement of facts as to what all the cattle were and the sheep in this district showing that from this case a pitifully small amount involved in the Indian issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.149" offset="15424575">And Mr. Black, agent for the Government, testified that out of an estimated 40,000, 30,000 belonged to one man, Charles Red.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.630" offset="15478491">The range of Sakezzie, when they cancelled his permit, was divided between Leland, Red and Velvet Red.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.153" offset="15508584">Those facts, even though the Court was unsuccessful in getting into the record the names of the permittees who were closing the vice on this little band of the last of the Mohicans in that area, still the fact show what was happening clearly and uncontrovertibly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.493" offset="15585907">And who was in the front line trench when they conducted this operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.898" offset="15603566">The same ranchers, that Leland, Red went and got the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.839" offset="15627285">The case can't go off on that of course.</text>
