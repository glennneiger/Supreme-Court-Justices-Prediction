            <label>Ms. Bessie Margolin</label>
            <text syncTime="11.029" offset="44095">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.886" offset="51513">When the Court adjourned yesterday afternoon, I was making the point that the Waialua decision certainly held that the mere fact that a processor is processing only his own crop that that mere fact was not sufficient to make it a -- an operation or a practice that is really incident to farming, that the Waialua decision said that there were many other factors which were at least as pertinent and even more pertinent to the question of whether the operation is really an incident to farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.847" offset="215353">In connection in the -- in the Waialua case, the names and quite a few of those factors and summarize the factors which the -- which the administrator has repeatedly called attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.455" offset="265718">Along those factors of course is the one as to whether farmers ordinarily carry on its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.988" offset="291944">Other factors where the size of the farming is compared with the size that they -- of the industrial operation, the extent of industrialization.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.696" offset="342727">There are two factors that -- that the respondent here rely upon which I think are important to bring out in the factual background because respondents represent these -- these factors in a way quite differently from what we think the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.820" offset="435200">And I might say in explanation of the apparent difference in the statements the -- of the respondents and the statement of the facts in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.426" offset="477623">These cases were really three cases or two cases but with three respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.469" offset="501864">They were tried on or decided on motions and cross-motions for summary judgment and most of the evidence was in the form of affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.144" offset="536555">So, there has been some confusion as to whether a particular affidavit relates to all three respondents or whether it relates to just the one respondent who put it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.706" offset="578769">But I think that confusion was clarified by the trial court's finding that it was obvious from the record as a whole that all of these plants, all of -- three of them are pretty much alike in physical operation and in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.920" offset="639582">The only difference being that two of them process only tobacco grown by themselves whereas the Budd plant admittedly purchases all the tobacco that it processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.676" offset="694648">So that the differences in our statement and the respondents' statement, I think, and they explained on that basis, respondents' attempt to say that certain facts that are in there as to King Edward like the equipment fact that there's no evidence on the record at all that King Edward requires any equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.453" offset="773747">Then few pages later, it says Budd's plant is the same as King Edward's and so -- so Budd must not have had any equipment, when the fact is, as I pointed out yesterday, that respondent Budd itself put in the evidence, specifically put in the evidence that a tremendous amount of valuable equipment was required to operate one of its plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.628" offset="1214485">Well, the -- the -- the tobacco is up to -- keep the heat and keep the -- above generating the -- as a heat.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.894" offset="1243533">I don't pretend to know too much about this, you have to have a huge bulk and it kind of -- it retains the heat and the fermentation occurs in that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.785" offset="1287105">But it isn't a simple volunteering process that respondents attempt to represent it to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.332" offset="1313228">It's quite different and requires as I say all this expensive, a tremendous industrial equipment and plant, it's a steam-heated plant and it has these sprays and the thermometers, these large thermometers.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.005" offset="1371951">And there's no question if you read the description of the equipment in Budd's -- in Budd's request for an admission that this is quite an industrialized plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.912" offset="1415628">Now, coming to the two factors which they also rely on and I think that their -- their brief also represents it in a way quite different from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.701" offset="1450736">The first is and the question of the interchange of employee, this Court said -- recognized that that might be a factor as the administrator has.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.584" offset="1498279">Now, the respondent makes the statement that all of the employees and this plant are ordinary tobacco farm laborers.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.493" offset="1541956">They just make that flat statement in the brief, page 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.039" offset="1556062">I want to ask the Court to please put a question mark by that because there's nothing in the record that would support any such sweeping statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.723" offset="1590857">There is a finding by the trial court that rested, by the way, not on evidence but on the fact that the Government never denied the repeated assertions of respondent that more than 50% of the workers in the plant -- that more than 50% of them also work part of the time on farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.571" offset="1674240">Now, we say that that is no basis for the sweeping statement that this were -- that all these employees are farm laborers.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.844" offset="1703288">And on the contrary, we think that the Court's finding in addition to the fact that it did not include all the worker, that the Court's finding is just as consistent with the conclusion that these were essentially industrial workers who sometimes also worked on farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.388" offset="1769535">And this was apparently the view of the trial court because they found that they were not engaged in farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.272" offset="1797016">So, there's no evidence that all in the record is to the relative amount of time the employees spend in the bulking plants and working on farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.119" offset="1836408">And in the absence of that evidence, I don't think it can be assumed that they were more farm work laborers than they were bulking plant laborers.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.584" offset="1870263">And I might remind the Court that this is the question of exemption which the Court has recognized that the burden of proof to prove that the conditions have been met as upon the employer claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.265" offset="1912999">Now, the other factor and as I pointed out that's just one factor, the interchange of employees we say is a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.838" offset="1943301">We think it's outweighed by all the other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.329" offset="1957303">The other factor is important because the Court of Appeals seems to have rested its decision to a considerable extent on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.731" offset="1986873">And that relates to the statement in the Court of Appeals that the bulking process is essential to the marketing of this type of tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.555" offset="2022191">The opinion doesn't state just what it means just whose market its talking about, but we say there is no basis in the record for respondents' repeated assertion that it had -- the assertion on pages 15 and 16 and I ask the Court put a question mark by those assertion, that this means that there is no market at an earlier stage for Type 62's backup, that it cannot be marketed until after it is bulked.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.282" offset="2137025">Those are the statements in respondents' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.533" offset="2150087">If they're referring to the farmers market and the -- apparently, the implication there is that this is the farmers market.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.970" offset="2175791">If they're referring to the farmers market, this is refuted specifically by the regular practice for both respondent Budd and King Edward to purchase this tobacco before it's bulked.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.798" offset="2227096">They purchased it before it's bulked.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.062" offset="2236186">Now, what King Edward does on the other two plants is not involved in this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.870" offset="2255412">Budd admittedly purchases all of the tobacco involved and King Edward purchases about two-thirds.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.057" offset="2296163">The -- the 1951 figure shows that the total amount bulk in all three of its plants was -- two-thirds of it was purchased from other grower.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.655" offset="2334616">Now, in these instances, the farmers certainly have a market for their tobacco before it's bulked, before it's processed.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.111" offset="2360424">The farmer is finished with the tobacco when he takes it to the -- when he leaves it at the bulking plant and he has nothing to do with the bulking process unless he happens to be hired as one of the employees in the plant in which case I can assure you he would want to get the minimum wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.439" offset="2421656">But so far as his capacity as a farmer is concerned, he has nothing further to do with the bulking process.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.558" offset="2450181">Now, the price he will eventually receive for his product may be determined on the grade after the bulking.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.243" offset="2476931">But he has disposed of it, definitely and irrevocably before the bulking process starts.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.668" offset="2502635">Now, there's also other evidence in the record which shows pretty clearly we think that the bulking process in these cases is incident to the manufacture of cigars rather than incident to farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.625" offset="2554462">For example, the record shows that the Budd plant is closely affiliated with the Budd Cigar Manufacturing Company or one of the husband members who's a respondent in this case is the president of the Budd Cigar Manufacturing Company which is at the same address -- the same address is the bulking plant, it's right next door and it has the same address.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.681" offset="2646622">And over two thirds of the tobacco bulked at the Budd plant is sold to the Budd Cigar Manufacturing Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.495" offset="2685910">Well, the question is, is this an incident to farming or is it an incident to manufacturing?</text>
            <text syncTime="676.885" offset="2707540">And we say that all the factors here militate in favor saying this is not an incident, a true incident to farming, this is really an incident to manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.937" offset="2751739">Now, the same is true -- a similar situation with King Edward.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.377" offset="2769502">The record shows that King Edward is closely affiliated with the John Swisher &amp; Son Cigar Company which is a well-known manufacturer of cigars.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.241" offset="2812865">The King Edward Cigar, I think, is one that's most permanently known and Swisher is the president -- Carl S. Swisher is the president of the King Edward Company and King Edward sells over 50% of its tobacco to Swisher and company, the cigar manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.005" offset="2895935">We think that evidence is very significant in showing that this bulking process is more -- is done more than incident to the cigar manufacturing than it is on behalf of the farmer, that it's much closer to the manufacturing than it is to the farmer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1453.860" offset="5815380">Senator Schwellenbach answered, “If a packing plant is working upon fresh fruits and vegetables in their raw and natural state within the immediate production of the area, it would be exempt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.225" offset="5860833">In other words, it is exempt if it meets the exemption, then when he comes -- then comes the question about the largest apple packing plant in the world in Winchester, Virginia and Senator Connally said, “That would be exempt, would it not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.678" offset="5922691">And I call the attention to the fact that he didn't mention the population of Winchester.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.532" offset="5942126">And this was Senator Schwellenbach's answer, “If the work is done in that plant, if it is as described in the amendment, it would be exempt."</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.002" offset="5979951">And in addition to the fact that Senator Schwellenbach carefully qualified his answers, he just said if they meet the condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.375" offset="6013492">I call attention to the fact that if the proposal he was talking about at the time did not contain a provision for the definition by the -- by the administrator and in his (Inaudible), immediately thereafter, he had a colloquy with Senator Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.098" offset="6076291">And Senator Black asked him specifically, “What about area?</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.347" offset="6093322">What would be the definition of area, would it be possible to define it more clearly?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.563" offset="6114220">And Senator Schwellenbach said, “I gave considerable thought to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.252" offset="6128953">I do not believe it is possible and that is something which the Board, which is accused of receiving too much power, would have to decide it, would have to provide the definition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.336" offset="6165316">Now, to be noted too that Senator Schwellenbach wasn't -- was not from the State of Virginia, he's from the State of Washington and there's no indication at all that he had any idea what the population of Winchester, Virginia was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.591" offset="6218292">And he certainly never said anything to indicate what he thought was of the population of the -- the proper standard to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.553" offset="6254132">He said that would have to be left to the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.546" offset="6266149">Now, finally, I might point out that Senator Schwellenbach was Secretary of Labor at the time this definition was issued and I think if Senator Schwellenbach had felt that it went beyond the authority of the administrator or that it was unreasonable that he would not have committed it to go into effect or to continue in -- in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.030" offset="6360085">If I may, I'd like to reserve a few remaining reason -- minutes for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.547" offset="6454126">I'm going to present the argument for King Edward and Budd and Mr. Hughes will present the argument for the May Tobacco Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.043" offset="6492160">At the outset, I should like to clarify, since there's -- there's been some confusion on this point precisely what the contentions here are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.594" offset="6538344">King Edward insists or contends that the employees and its packing plant in Quincy are within the exemption which Section 13 (a) (6) of the Act grants to employees employed in agriculture as that term is defined in Section 3 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.410" offset="6641580">The Budd Company, as Ms. Margolin has several times stated, does not claim that this exemption applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.707" offset="6674808">If in fact the Court agrees with the holding of the court below that the agricultural exemption does apply to the packing plant of King Edward then that disposes of a case as far as King Edward is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.225" offset="6736875">It is only if the Court disagrees with that contention that our next inordinate contention arises which is that under Section 13 (a) (10) of the Act, the employees and King Edward's packing plant are engaged in performing operations which are described in that Section, that the administrator's definition of area of production insofar as it contains a population limitation is unauthorized and that until the administrator does issue a valid definition excluding the employees at King Edward's packing plant, he's not entitled to the injunction in which he sought here in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.740" offset="7098932">It is true that there is also an exemption in another section of the Act from the child labor provisions for employees and agriculture when outside of school hours.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.894" offset="7311569">King Edward operates farms in the Gadsden County, Florida on which it grows under cheesecloth shade, United States Type 62 tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.099" offset="7364336">This type of tobacco is grown only in three counties in Florida and in two adjacent counties in Georgia and nowhere else in the world except in -- in consequential amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.987" offset="7403938">When the tobacco leaves are harvested, they are carried immediately to curing barns located on the farm.</text>

            <text syncTime="1906.549" offset="7626188">That's all part of a continuos process which results in this fermented tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.572" offset="7646250">The -- when the tobacco arrives at the packing plant, it is piled in bulks on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.652" offset="7678537">And in answer to a question to Mr. Justice Clark, whatever heating equipment there is in the plant is just equipment which heats the entire plant, not anything which is specifically in there to heat the bulks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.400" offset="7745515">The entire fermentation operation is just, as the Court of Appeals below found, a natural process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.839" offset="7783340">During a period of about two to four months, these tobacco leaves in the box are shifted about in order to air them and in order to make certain that the changes in the leaves throughout the bulk will be uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.686" offset="7854707">After they've been there for two to four months, they are sprayed with water to keep them pliable for handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.576" offset="7878217">They are thereafter graded by hand and then re-bulked to dry out for a further period of two to four months after which they are valid for sale to the cigar manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.315" offset="7921162">Now, in King Edwards's case the only tobacco that it handles in this packing plant is tobacco it grows itself on its farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.529" offset="7958047">As we see them, the -- there are several facts which I think should be emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.011" offset="7988036">First, the transfer of the leaves from the barns, the packing plant, must be prompt in order to avoid any harm to the natural changes that are taking place in the leaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.410" offset="8037564">The entire process of treating the leaf from the time it is hanged in the curing barns until the fermentation is completed in the packing plant is one continuos process of natural transformation within the leaf necessary to assure the desired color and appearance of the leaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.155" offset="8108617">The process is a drying one accompanied by chemical changes which start at the barn and continue throughout the bulk sweating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.443" offset="8141740">There is no dividing point between the changes appearing at the two places.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.785" offset="8167131">Second, the entire process is completed without adding any external or artificial element or stimulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.407" offset="8197538">As I said a moment ago, the operation is entirely a natural way, only the temperature and humidity are regulated both at the barns and in the packing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.067" offset="8240170">Third, the bulk sweating and baling of a tobacco at the packing plant are customary and essential operations to prepare King Edward's tobacco for market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.129" offset="8280503">The Court of Appeals below so found and the record amply supports this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.143" offset="8300565">Ms. Margolin has a question to some of the assertions in our brief on this subject in a moment or two when I get into the legal argument, I shall answer some of the things she said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.931" offset="8351660">Fourth, the King Edward's packing plant operations are clearly not industrialized and the record does not show that the plant has extensive or expensive equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2689.487" offset="10757851">Taking up first the statutory language, Section 3 (f), defining agriculture is divided into two distinct branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.476" offset="10793900">The first branch sets forth what this Court is characterized as the primary meaning of agriculture, farming and all its branches, cultivation and tillage of the soil, production, cultivation, growing and harvesting of agricultural commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.732" offset="10870909">Then there is a second distinct branch, agriculture in which this Court has called the broader meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.847" offset="11159301">Secondly, the activities of its packing plant employees as found below are essential to prepare the tobacco for market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.048" offset="11196186">And third, the preparation of the tobacco from the time it's first hung in the curing barn until the fermentation is completed and the packing takes place in the packing plant is one continuous and integrated process largely performed by the same employees who grow and harvest the tobacco on King Edward's farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.086" offset="11276330">These operations, we say, come within the words preparation for market which appear in the statutory definition as an example of the incidental and conjunctive practices Congress meant to exempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3025.012" offset="12100023">We say that preparation for market with respect to Type 62 tobacco must mean the operation here, they, being the preparatory operations upon this tobacco before it's marketed by King Edward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.814" offset="12143177">Now, on the question of -- of whether in fact these operations are essential to prepare the tobacco for market, I might say first that so long as we establish that in fact King Edward is doing this work upon its tobacco in preparing it for market, I don't think it makes too much difference whether in fact this work can be characterized as -- as essential to get the tobacco ready for market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.110" offset="12292389">But the fact remains that in this very record we have findings that this is customary and essential work to prepare King Edward's tobacco fro market.</text>

            <text syncTime="3141.385" offset="12565525">I might also say on this question of whether this work is essential to prepare the tobacco for market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.684" offset="12590707">This comprehensive agriculture definition goes far beyond readying something for market, the language upon which the Government relies in this supplemental appendix they filed from a Department of Agriculture publication, which publication, I might add, may or may not have any application to the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.570" offset="12670224">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.887" offset="12675448">It certainly can't be permitted to impeach findings which appear in the record with respect to this particular case and operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.165" offset="12704601">But that comprehensive language goes way beyond readying for market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.434" offset="12717662">It includes such things as delivery to market, delivery to carriers who catch fish in the market, things that take place up to the point where the farmer disposes of his product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.374" offset="12769489">Now, the legislative history of this agricultural exemption, we submit, fairly and reinforces the conclusion that these operations are within the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.516" offset="12834064">Congress started with a very broad definition of agriculture and as it worked its way through, the bill worked its way through the passage, the exemption was made more and more inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.923" offset="12879621">Congress made a claim that it wished to exempt such “processing” operations, it used that word processing in such operations as (Inaudible) bottling, apple packing, cotton ginning, hog slaughtering when performed by the farmer upon his own produce and it also made a claim that it desired that result regardless of the exemption status under the Act of processing done by an independent plant separate from the grower.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.252" offset="12992993">It enacted Section 13 (a) (10) to deal with that latter situation, and I'll come to that shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.931" offset="13047641">I would just like to say this further word about the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.617" offset="13066449">I don't believe that any legislative history could be much clearer on congressional intent to exempt such operations as we have here -- as is this legislative history and its fully reviewed in the -- in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.763" offset="13150981">I come now to the cases and I'll take up the question of the Waialua case right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.284" offset="13185045">We submit that the only two decisions of the Court dealing with this agricultural exemption, namely, the Farmers Irrigation case and the Waialua decision show that the operations here are exempt and for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.868" offset="13251396">The factors which the Court emphasized in the Waialua case are largely present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.915" offset="13275638">The Court there indicated that virtually all forms of quasi industrial processing upon agricultural commodities other than sugar milling are enumerated in Section 13 (a) (10) and if they are enumerated there, the implication of the decision was there within the agricultural exemption when performed by the farmer upon his own products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.923" offset="13367589">And as we'll show, the operations that take place here are among those enumerated in 13 (a) (10).</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.428" offset="13397682">This is not like sugar milling which is not in 13 (a) (10).</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.642" offset="13410534">The operations here are handling, packing, storing and drying in agricultural commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.335" offset="13441254">King Edward's growing operation is substantial and it's not a mere façade for in otherwise industrial operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.130" offset="13472496">The product resulting from King Edward's operations is fermented tobacco leaf which involves only natural changes in the leaf which -- this differs from milling sugar cane which transfers that cane by a manufacturing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.998" offset="13527980">And here, the same employees work on the farm and on the packing plant and they're not typical factory workers but largely -- but unskilled farmer -- laborers largely engaged in manual work, the packing plant operation is not industrialized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.080" offset="13584300">These are all the factors the Court -- virtually all of the factors the Court emphasized in Waialua as being pertinent to a determination of whether the exemption applies but it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.407" offset="13625574">Now, we say they're present here even though they were absent in Waialua.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.376" offset="13653473">Now, the Government argues that there is no exemption under this agricultural exemption if the operation is not exempt under Section 13 (a) (10) and they say the operations here are not exempt under 13 (a) (10).</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.920" offset="13695582">Therefore, they're not within the agricultural exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.224" offset="13712823">Well, to this we reply that, first, the operations here are among those enumerated in 13 (a) (10) and secondly, the statements upon which the Government relies in the Waialua case are applicable only to sugar milling which this Court recognized was a unique boarder line case and those statement cannot be given the sweeping construction for which the Government contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.066" offset="13816163">For example, you have ginning of cotton which is an operation except under Section 13 (a) (10) if performed within the area of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.729" offset="13850854">Well, obviously, there are some gins that are not within the area of production and that doesn't mean, certainly, that a farmer who gins his own cotton isn't within the agricultural exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.167" offset="13884604">This Court said otherwise and Waialua said that such a farmer was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.152" offset="13900591">But the Government's argument would mean that that person is not exempt because there are always some cotton gins that are not within the area of production and therefore they're -- the operation is sometimes not exempt under 13 (a) (10).</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.654" offset="13950537">We think that the Court in Waialua meant to apply the -- its decision there to sugar milling, a unique border line case, I repeat to use the language of the -- of this Court and not generally to the type of situation we have involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.173" offset="14028591">Now, the Government recognized in this very record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.679" offset="14038622">It -- it's been relying upon admissions and requests for admissions and in this very record it admitted that the all embracing agricultural exemption didn't depend upon the 13 (a) (10) exemption for independent operators and it repeated that in testimony before Congress as late as 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.570" offset="14138201">Finally, with respect to the administrative interpretations that are published and outstanding by them, they're -- they're original interpretation specifically exempted the operation we have here when performed by a farmer upon his own product and it's never been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.239" offset="14200895">This case represents their effort to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.145" offset="14212493">It's never been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.590" offset="14218344">It was in effect on the date of the 1949 amendments and were repeated in general terms by the Department of Labor to the House Labor Committee in hearings preceding the 1949 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.441" offset="14261708">The Government has no support and those amendments are otherwise aren't overturning this interpretation of almost 17 years standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.591" offset="14286263">This is like the hauling of sugarcane that was involved in Waialua, where their initial interpretation exempted it, they tried to say they had changed it and this Court said they had not, this is precisely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.103" offset="14340389">The original interpretation which has never been changed until they brought this case was that these operations are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.300" offset="14381140">I turn now to the Budd case and to the argument on Section 13 (a) (10) which applies both to King Edward and Budd if the Court does not -- of the view that King Edward falls within the agricultural exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.534" offset="14458044">The facts of Budd's packing plant operation are very much the same as those of King Edward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.434" offset="14489704">The major difference is that Budd does not grow its own tobacco rather it gets tobacco from farmers in the locality within a radius of about 30 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.067" offset="14540173">The -- we've already gone through the matter of what the record shows with respect to the equipment in Budd's plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.998" offset="14567967">The employees there do work earlier in the year harvesting and barn curing the tobacco which they thereafter handle at Budd's packing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.088" offset="14604330">Now, the exemption under Section 13 (a) (10) applies to employees who meet three requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.320" offset="14641215">First, they must perform the operations which are described in that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.115" offset="14660441">Secondly, they must be performing those operations for market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.872" offset="14671412">And thirdly, they must be performing them in the area of production as defined by the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.754" offset="14690952">As to the first two requirements, the Court of Appeals held that they were satisfied and as to the third requirement, the Court of Appeals -- well, the plants do satisfy the definition as to mileage, limit their distance from farms where the tobacco is grown but they don't satisfy the population requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.503" offset="14765976">The Court of Appeals held that that requirement was invalid as applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.418" offset="14785620">So far as the for market of limitation is concerned, the Government does not deny that the packing plant operation --</text>

            <text syncTime="4514.810" offset="18059180">These cases were consolidated by the District Judge solely as a matter of his convenience but the records are different and in his opinion he says so in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.461" offset="18129816">He says that the facts as to the King Edward case and as to the May case, which is my case, are quite different from those in the Budd case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.717" offset="18170776">Now, I stress the fact that we are intervenors only in the King Edward case and that the record before Your Honors on this motion for summary judgement so far as we are concerned are the moving and opposing affidavits on our particular motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.543" offset="18254158">Now, coming to the factual situation, let me say this that if we -- if we establish the fact under Section 3 (f) that we are within the exemption then it is unimportant, in fact, you don't even reach the question as to whether the exemption provided by Section 13 (a) (10) applies to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.544" offset="18374113">And so in our brief, we have briefed only that one point and we have relied entirely upon the brief of Budd and King Edward for the proposition that we are also covered by the Section 13 (a) (10) exemption and we simply adopt their argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="4650.114" offset="18600438">-- our principal point is this, that May's employees who worked in its packing plant are engaged in agriculture as agriculture is defined in Section 3 (f) of the Act and because they are engaged in agriculture, they are exempt under Section 13 (a) (6) of the Act because Section 13 (a) (6) of the Act says in so many words that an employee employed in agriculture is exempt from the wage and hour provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.735" offset="18746932">So, it is to that proposition that -- and that alone that our brief is directed and I want briefly to give you our factual situation because it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.176" offset="18800640">May owns its own farms in Gadsden County.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.276" offset="18825091">May owns only one packing plant and I use the word “packing plant” advisedly because that's what it is and that's what it has always been known as and that's how it's referred to in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.749" offset="18882978">At -- May only does the bulking of its own tobacco in its own tobacco plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.847" offset="18915370">May does not do any bulking and by that I mean the process which Mr. Denbo has described, the piling and re-piling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.950" offset="18955703">It does not perform any of those functions on anybody else's tobacco, only its own tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.490" offset="18989871">Now, I repeat also that the -- what occurs here and it's been loosely referred to as processing is nothing but a curing operation, the tobacco is picked, it's first put in the curing barns, the tobacco barn as we know it where it remains for a while and then is transferred immediately to the packing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.310" offset="19105228">And this packing plant, what is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.331" offset="19117244">It's been referred to as a highly industrialized operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.859" offset="19135425">Well, what it amounts to is, it -- it is a heated enclosure and in that heated enclosure, all that happens is that these people who perform the -- the functions on the farm of tilling the soil and picking the tobacco also perform this function and all that they do is to put this into piles of 3500 to 4000 pounds of tobacco and after those piles have settled for a while, they pull them apart again and re-pile them so that what was inside comes to the outside and so that there is an even distribution of temperature and an even curing of the tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.398" offset="19317551">But the big point, Your Honors, is that from the time it's picked until the time it emerges from that packing plant for sale, it is still tobacco leaf.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.504" offset="19370005">It has changed from green to brown but it's still tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.330" offset="19389231">It has -- had no manufacturing process to which it has been subjected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.632" offset="19410442">It hasn't been stemmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.936" offset="19415667">It hasn't been cooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.510" offset="19421936">In short, nothing has been done to it except to aid the natural process of curing and it's no different than the ripening of an apple or the ripening of a tomato.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.684" offset="19470733">And so, I want to implant that on Your Honors minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.283" offset="19489123">That's what the record says.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.058" offset="19496229">There can't be any possible question about it as far as the May Company is concerned and I now turn -- and I would like, Your Honors, to parse with you in point one of our brief, the language of the agricultural exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.998" offset="19575954">And I repeat, it's an exemption of agriculture and it's not an exemption of farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.293" offset="19597166">It's a much broader term.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.552" offset="19606152">And what does -- what does Section 3 say?</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.261" offset="19620989">It exempts farming in all its branches including the tillage of the soil plus something else and what is that plus something else?</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.302" offset="19661113">It's any practices performed by a farmer and here's a farmer, that's all we are and it's conceded that the operation up to the time it leaves the curing barn to go the packing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.519" offset="19726002">It's conceded that up to that point we're within the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.571" offset="19742198">But at that point, where -- these are practices performed by a farmer as an incident to and in conjunction with the farming operations and what are they in this case including preparation for market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.154" offset="19804578">Now, in our case, the May record, the record is transparently clear and the Court found that what was done here was essential for the marketing of our tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.271" offset="19857032">And our tobacco is not sold until all that process has been completed at which time we sell it to cigar manufacturers who use it for cigar wrapper.</text>

            <text syncTime="4995.363" offset="19981375">Waialua as we construe it and properly read supports us because as I read Waialua, the big thing that bothered the majority of this Court was that there was an actual manufacturing operation involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.824" offset="20059220">In that case, the sugar cane was actually milled.</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.177" offset="20084611">It was subjected to a machining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.299" offset="20097149">As a result of which, it was transformed into two other substances, namely, raw sugar and molasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.953" offset="20131736">Now, I say you can't fail to read the case without coming to the conclusion that that was the big factor that influenced the majority and even then, they said that it was a borderline case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.438" offset="20185652">In addition to that, the majority opinion listed seven factors and it said, “These are the factors you use in -- in trying to measure whether a thing is farming or isn't farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.929" offset="20251690">And it's the totality of those factors, not one alone that counts but the totality of them."</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.096" offset="20280320">And in that case, the -- as I remember it, Waialua failed to meet three of the seven tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.924" offset="20315638">Here, we meet them all and I'm not going to take the time because I haven't got it to spell them out except to say that on pages 10 and 11 of our brief, we very tersely describe with record references how we meet every single one of those tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.778" offset="20395050">And I say to Your Honors now that if May is not exempt, then the language practices performed by a farmer as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations including preparation for market as that appears in Section 3 (f), I say that that is -- is rendered meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.053" offset="20500167">If Your Honors say that we aren't covered by that, then I can't conceive of any kind of agriculture that would be covered by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5385.581" offset="21542243">Well, it -- it has not been specifically modified and I think that's what -- where some of the confusion has come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.104" offset="21568366">It was issued way in 1939 and -- and even in that bulletin if Your Honor will recall, it is stated that an operation done on a farm or where the product is processed, the process is just processing his own product, even though it's off the farm, it might be agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.623" offset="21658436">And among the examples giving -- given was bulking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.761" offset="21679020">That has caused us a lot of headaches just like the original interpretation we put out and we gave an example, sugar milling, if it were done by the employer just on his own crop.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.361" offset="21725414">After the Bowie case and -- and the administrator to that extent is responsible for some of the confusion and I think the Court probably realizes by now that this is an extremely complex and difficult subject area and it's extremely widespread and we had made our mistakes frankly too.</text>
            <text syncTime="5451.880" offset="21807438">But after the Bowie case came out, we did come out specifically and say with respect to sugar milling that apparently the administrator went too far in saying that the mere fact that the farmer or that the processor was just processing his own crop, put him into agriculture, we said that -- that we went too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.550" offset="21890194">Well, we've also said the same thing about bulking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.364" offset="21905450">Now, we haven't -- we -- we have put in our supplemental appendix and I don't want to take too much time to go over this because I want to get to the point on the legislative history of area of production, but we put in our supplemental appendix the context of the decision -- of the opinions of the administrator that respondents rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.374" offset="21993430">And the Court will find that in every one of those cases, he has qualified it carefully by saying, “If you meet these conditions."</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.970" offset="22023837">The conditions which this Court set forth in the Waialua opinion in addition to other conditions which this Court says are also pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.385" offset="22069499">In every -- in every one of these opinion since the Bowie case in relation to canning and vegetable and in relation to tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.559" offset="22122162">The administrator has been very careful to -- not say that they would be engaged in agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.119" offset="22148389">He's been very careful to say if you meet these tests and I think you'll see in the context that that -- that he has been careful to say that, although he may have been originally responsible for some of the confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.735" offset="22206903">Now, to come back to the area of production thing, I think that Justice Frankfurter has pointed out that this is a regulation of general application applies to numerous industries, operations on over 300 -- more than 300 commodities and necessarily it may not -- any definition, a regulation may not operate in every particular case to carry out the full intent of Congress, assuming that that intent is as clear as respondent seem to think.</text>
            <text syncTime="5587.039" offset="22348069">But the fact that it might operate in a particular case under those circumstances certainly wouldn't invalidate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.083" offset="22388297">As a matter of fact, as this Court said in Holly Hill, that that is precisely the thought of -- of standard that have to be left to the administrator and not to the diversities and inevitable contingencies or the other way around, contingencies and inevitable diversity of particular litigated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5617.801" offset="22471158">That the simple answer to this thing, to this whole question and there is a simple and decisive answer and the Court does not need to concern itself with all the headache the administrator has had trying to see what is the feasible definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.969" offset="22539807">And by the way, respondents' proposals have been very seriously considered by the administrator and if the Court will read our supplemental appendix setting forth the findings of the hearing officer which were adopted by the administrator, you will see how carefully and thoroughly the administrator has explored just as precisely their suggestion here that he look into the income and try to determine and he considers specifically whether it would be feasible to have an escape clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.595" offset="22666344">Well, it was obvious that there's not enough data or -- or there's simply not the data available, any reliable data and everyone would be coming in to ask for the escape clause and he had no data on which to -- to base the decision which would have an escape clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="5705.536" offset="22822139">But I come now to the simple answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5707.520" offset="22830080">There is a simple and decisive answer to this area of production question and that is that Congress has ratified in 1949 amending act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5721.957" offset="22887758">The -- this definition has been before Congress repeatedly -- repeatedly and all of the same criticisms that are made here were made to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5732.140" offset="22928509">In fact, the administrator and the secretary themselves, these excessive administrators and secretary have told Congress that -- that we're not satisfied with this definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="5758.140" offset="23032477">And Congress, although repeatedly asked to these -- through these other things, decided not to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5764.796" offset="23059122">They have declined specific proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.350" offset="23073332">They have declined specific proposals by Mr. Todd and in 1949, when the proposal was made to transfer this authority to the Secretary of Agriculture, they declined to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.755" offset="23126936">They went ahead and enacted several other amendments, many other amendments because they reviewed the Fair Labor Standards Act comprehensively and there was a proposal to amend Section 13 (a) (10).</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.014" offset="23183987">Some people wanted the area of production exemption taken out entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="5810.701" offset="23242710">They decided that for a variety of reasons because of the complexity of the subject and their interest in enacting other amendments at that -- at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5819.796" offset="23279177">They decided to -- to leave the law as it was and it -- that was specifically said so in the House Manager's report in reporting why they had adopted the Senate version.</text>
            <text syncTime="5831.099" offset="23324317">And it was -- they just specifically decided and they put in this express provision when they enacted the other amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5837.948" offset="23351693">They put in this Section (c) -- 16 (c) provision which expressly kept in effect any regulation order, interpretation of the administrator in effect at the time at the -- on the effective date as to the language on the effective date of the amendment -- of the amending act.</text>
