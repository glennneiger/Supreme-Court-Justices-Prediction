            <text syncTime="31.289" offset="125074">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and presents the question whether the prohibition against double jeopardy in the Fifth Amendment bars the Government's recovery from petitioner of the statutory sum of $2000 provided in section 26 (b) (1) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 pertaining surplus property by a fraud when on the admitted facts the Government had no loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.724" offset="258821">The statute involved here substance -- in substance provides that every person who shall use or engage in any fraudulent trick, scheme or device for the purpose of securing or obtaining surplus property --</text>

            <label>Mr. Gustave H. Dongus</label>
            <text syncTime="83.054" offset="332173">-- shall pay to the United States the sum of $2,000 for each such Act and double the amount of any damage which the United States may have sustained by reason thereof, together with the cause for them to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.289" offset="389120">In addition, the -- I may point out that the statute under subsections 2 and 3 provide two alternative remedies to the Government; namely, that the United States may recover, as liquidated damage, twice the consideration agreed to be paid or as a further alternative, the Government may keep the property or rather recover the property and keep the consideration was --which has been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.377" offset="513463">Now, those two alternative remedies are not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.351" offset="537391">What is involved is this flat sum of $2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.152" offset="560588">The facts alleged in the Government's complaint and in the petitioner's answer on which the case was submitted by motions for summary judgment are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.485" offset="609907">The Government's complaint contained five separate counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.498" offset="629969">Count one alleged that in June 1947, at Tinker Field in Oklahoma, petitioner did cause a named individual to make a false statement of a material fact in writing to the War Assets Administration for the purpose of obtaining a certain described motor truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.023" offset="716069">The false statements were statements qualifying the persons -- the person's name in each of the counts as a veteran for priority right to purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.603" offset="750341">Counts two through five are identical with count one, as except, as to the name of the person involved and the description of the motor vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.417" offset="789629">Judgment was asked for $2000 on each count or a total of $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.613" offset="822439">Petitioner in its answer pleaded that the Government's action was to recover a statutory penalty and was not for the collection of any obligation or indebtedness owing to the United States or for the recovery of any damage suffered by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.181" offset="884715">And the petitioner had previously been indicted in the District Court -- Federal District Court in Oklahoma in this --in five counts on this very same five transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.490" offset="945946">And that he had pleaded nolo contendere in the criminal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.019" offset="972069">And that the court had imposed a total fine of $25,000 and which fine was paid by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.693" offset="1014700">The petitioner had then further alleged in his answer that the trucks in question were advertised, offered for sale by the War Assets Administration at a fixed price.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.187" offset="1060676">And that under the terms of the sale, certain Government agencies, individuals were given the priority right to purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.194" offset="1096725">That the federal agencies had a higher priority than certified veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.695" offset="1118772">And that this petitioner had a nonpriority right to purchase, as a dealer in certain types of machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.014" offset="1160046">The answer further alleged that respondent was not damaged, as the Government was not damaged, did not suffer any loss because of the sale of the trucks and had received the full advertised offering price and if the trucks hadn't been sold to the petitioner or others, it would have been sold at the same price to other priority or nonpriority purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.585" offset="1262237">And concluded was the allegation that the complaint seeks to recover a further penalty in addition to the criminal fine previously paid by petitioner, thereby, placing it in double jeopardy, contrary to the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.151" offset="1344575">The Government's motion for summary judgment on the pleadings was sustained that petitioner was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.900" offset="1379579">And judgment was entered against petitioner in the sum of $10,000 or $2000 on each of the five counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.501" offset="1425972">That judgment was affirmed by the court below which held that the provision in section 26 (b) (1) for the payment of this $2000 was compensatory and not penal in nature and therefore petitioner's defense of double jeopardy was no bar to this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.423" offset="1525656">Now, the statute itself distinguishes between the sum of $2000 and the double damages which are recoverable.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.050" offset="1568183">Now as observed by the Sixth Circuit in the United States versus Witherspoon, reported in 211 F.2d which involved a limitation's question, the Court said there that the exaction of the arbitrary sum of $2000 for each offense of obtaining surplus property by fraud without regard to the value of the property is a provision for a penalty and that its purpose is to punish an offense against the public justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.385" offset="1713528">Now, the Government in their brief in this case contends that this $2000, plus double damages, is a reasonable measure of a forseeable damages to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.540" offset="1770057">And mentions the fact that surplus property included such items as ships, war plants, port and harbor facilities, strategic materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.323" offset="1817287">But at the other end of the scale, it also included such items as desks, chairs, filing cabinets, typewriters and some items costing as little as 10 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.920" offset="1879667">But under the Government's contention, it may indict and punish a man criminally for the fraud, no matter how picayunish or small the item may be and then later also collect this $2000 penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.994" offset="1959915">The Government contends that the decisions of this Court in the United States, or rather, Marcus v.Hess and in 317 United States and in Mitchell versus United States in 303 United States, require they do not compel the holding in this case that the statute is remedial to provide restitution for damage to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.403" offset="2097528">And they go on to argue and now I quote from page 11 to 12 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.325" offset="2125218">That once it is decided that this is a remedial action and I quote, “The remedy applies to all cases, under the statute, irrespective of their individual facts or a proof of actual damage."</text>
            <text syncTime="548.460" offset="2193763">In other words, the facts of the case make no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.651" offset="2214557">That this amount is recoverable, the remedy inexorably apply in all cases within the sweep of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.372" offset="2265443">Now, we submit that neither the Hess case or the Mitchell case are authority for this sweeping doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.627" offset="2318420">In the Hess case, if the Court will recall, the action was brought under the False Claims Act which provided that whoever shall commit certain frauds on the Government shall forfeit and pay the sum of $2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.965" offset="2411833">And in addition the Government may recover double damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.211" offset="2440777">The defendants in that case were charged with conspiring by means of certain fraudulent collusive bids on certain Government contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.120" offset="2524473">The defendants, as the petitioner here, had previously been indicted, and a criminal fine had been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.485" offset="2569927">And they pleaded double jeopardy, just as we do or rather the petitioner does here.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.153" offset="2600542">This Court, in holding that the double jeopardy provision was not applicable, pointed out that the application of the -- the Double Jeopardy Clause to particular cases has not been an easy task for the courts, stating that the subject had been recently thoroughly explored in Helvering v.Mitchell in 303 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.176" offset="2728647">And that the cases there emphasized the line between several remedial actions brought primarily to protect the Government from financial loss and actions intended to authorize criminal punishment to vindicate public justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.864" offset="2799386">And the court there said, the question for that and decision in that case is whether the statute imposed a criminal sanction in that case, however, as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.438" offset="2857691">The Court then said there's enough for present purposes if we conclude that the instant proceedings are remedial and impose a several sanction and went on to say that the key purpose of the statute was to provide for restitution to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.118" offset="2928431">In other words, the Government has to have a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.611" offset="2942433">Now, in this case, the Government has admitted that they had no loss.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.370" offset="3029473">Yes, at page 8 at the top, we recite there in our answer that by reason of the facts above set forth, the plaintiff was not damaged -- was not damaged and did not suffer any loss because of the sale of the trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.894" offset="3087569">Now, on the motion for summary judgment, those facts are admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.335" offset="3109303">So, they had no loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.240" offset="3112960">And that the Government had no loss in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.912" offset="3127589">But they say they're entitled to recover this $2000, although the petitioner's already have been punished for the fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.631" offset="8190433">Now, in Marcus and -- the majority's approach there was to determine whether or not the -- the $2000 for the sum was double damage provision of the False Claims Act was compensatory of penal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.797" offset="8255112">The Court, relying and while referring to its early case in Helvering versus Mitchell said that the question was one of the statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.119" offset="8304431">And then, at one -- proceeded to point out that the Government can sue and as a private inquirer has rights similar to a private person in enforcing its contracts that it has two capacities in the sense, one quite sovereign in which it brings suits to -- suits to take care of the public justice, to protect the public justice, and secondly has a capacity as --as a private person on which it has rights to sue for breach of contract, should cover, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.043" offset="8440163">And in the -- the Court held that in the latter capacity without -- that the Court would -- that the United States was proceeding in the latter capacity as of -- as of a quite politic in Marcus and Hess and as such was entitled to recover for fraud in which it was perpetuated upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.490" offset="8505887">And as a result, the Court went on to hold at -- on page 18 of our brief that -- that we think that the chief purpose of a statute here which is the False Claims Act, where they had a similar provision such as we have here, was to provide for restitution to the Government of money taking prominent by fraud, and that the device of double damages plus a specific sum was chosen to make sure that the Government would be made completely whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.799" offset="8623125">The inherent difficulty of choosing a proper specific sum recognizing that it's difficult to fix the sum of -- of -- by -- and approve a sum by damages, would be -- which would give full restitution was a problem for Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.985" offset="8683938">And so the Court affirmed as compensatory and therefore, not involving violating the double jeopardy provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.760" offset="8718942">The $2000 plus double damage provision of the False Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.784" offset="8739109">Now, we think that provision is fully applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.635" offset="8754469">I mean that holding is very applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.929" offset="8767634">In the first place, the two statutes that we have are -- have this very same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.791" offset="8791144">The Surplus Property Act was designed in this provision 26 (b) (1) and the following b (2) and b (3), are all designed to protect the Government against the perpetration or enable the Government to recover for fraud perpetuated by -- on it and we got the Surplus Property Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.473" offset="8865855">The False Claims Act involved in Marcus and Hess was designed to prevent -- permit the Government to recover for frauds perpetuated on it in connection with False Claims generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.168" offset="8912666">So, the purpose of the two statutes was generally the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.601" offset="8926354">Now, the language of the two statutes were generally the same, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.447" offset="8945685">The only material and difference between the -- the two provisions that involved in Marcus and Hess and that involved here, is that the False Claims Act provides for certain pay in this statute it -- it provides to pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.225" offset="9000856">And as I say -- really hasn't -- that the language in Marcus and Hess, if anything, was just stronger rather than the -- the language here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.310" offset="9029172">And thirdly I'd like to point out that Marcus and Hess was decided on -- in January of 1943 which is about 15 months prior to the enactment of the Surplus Property Act here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.619" offset="9090403">So, we think it's drawing from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.661" offset="9098553">It's -- it's the fair assumption that the Congress had in mind this Court's interpretation of the language in this False Claims Act in enacting the comparable language of the Surplus Property Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.753" offset="9154978">Now, in addition, the Court in Marcus and Hess and in Helvering and Mitchell pointed out that it's really a question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.764" offset="9194998">So, it's appropriate in these circumstances to look at the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.480" offset="9213910">Now, when doing that, first you look to the face of the Surplus Property Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.583" offset="9234286">You'll notice that Section 26 (d) which is on page 3 of our brief refers to civil remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.328" offset="9269290">Referring back to Section 26 (b) quite characterizes that civil remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.773" offset="9294994">The civil remedies provided in this section shall be in addition to all other civil remedies and penalties provided by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.052" offset="9324147">Secondly, its -- I'd like to point out that Section b (1) which is the provision that's involved here, appears in the same section with b (2) and b (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.931" offset="9375660">And as my Brother says that both b (2) and b (3) deal with liquidated damages, expressly provide that to compensate the Government shall recover liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.528" offset="9422054">So that we think it's unlikely that Congress would include in a single provision of b (1), b (2), and b (3), when 2 are compensatory and 3 is intended to be penal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2382.649" offset="9530514">I would like to point out, however, and I will get to that, I just wanted, if I may just go through this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.309" offset="9553189">I do want to point out that we don't concede that there was no damage here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.284" offset="9581087">That it's true the suit that we brought here was just for the $2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.222" offset="9600836">But that is because -- although there was damage that the Government was -- did suffer damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.419" offset="9629675">But there were damages that were the type which just can't be reduced to a -- a monetary amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.988" offset="9659873">And it's the very function of a liquidated damage provision of contracts are this minimum damage provisions of $2000 here on minimum damages in your copyright statute or -- or did say a double damages in your -- in your Fair Labor Standards Act with -- with the element of additional to double damage in the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.171" offset="9760601">All of which recognized that there are situations where a defendant by his actions come first commits a legal wrong against the plaintiff and which, however, it's impossible to -- the damages can't be reduced to a financial amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.062" offset="9836147">You take a copyright case -- a -- which is just one example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.599" offset="9858299">A -- someone infringes on a copyright, has a copyright for dramatic production say, like in (Inaudible) that you have set out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.849" offset="9899363">The plaintiff -- the defendant infringes by -- by lifting from someone else's play it seemed and -- use, incorporates in the play which he produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.685" offset="9950668">It's pretty clear that the -- that the owner of the -- of the copyright, the plaintiff has been injured as result to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.472" offset="9977835">Yet, how to reduce that to money amount?</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.200" offset="9988702">It seems it's almost impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.715" offset="9994762">So, as a net result, the copyright statute has a schedule of statutory damage of so much -- so much for this type of infringement, so much for this type of thing, with a -- with a minimum, I think, in the sum of $50 to $250.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.045" offset="10064144">And that's -- that's common.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.143" offset="10072503">I mean that's -- that's -- you go to -- go to the Woolworth case which was before this Court in 344 U.S. where the -- there was an infringement under -- of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.786" offset="10111060">Woolworth had -- had the statute, a -- a piece of the statute which they were selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.573" offset="10142198">That in that case, Woolworth proved that they had -- their profit I -- I recollect was about $900 of -- then they were the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.410" offset="10181590">The plaintiff couldn't prove any actual loss from his infringement.Yet the Court affirmed the $5000 award under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.700" offset="10210743">Now, we think that we were damaged here in a number of ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.082" offset="10360268">At least, what -- let me rephrase it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.124" offset="10368418">That the paragraph 10, is really a summary of what the Court -- what the defendant is alleging in the prior paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.120" offset="10400392">And it says that by reason of the facts above set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.819" offset="10415229">Now, the only facts that they set forth are that this -- that this -- the product -- the -- the vehicles were sold -- were -- were being sold at the sale at Tinker Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.176" offset="10468624">That the -- there was first to go to priority holders and then they go to nonpriority holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.488" offset="10489940">That if the priority holders exhausted -- then exhausted, that will go to nonpriority holders at the same price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.070" offset="10520242">And all they're really saying by -- by reason of the facts above set forth, is that the Government suffered no monetary damages on the -- of that sale at -- at -- by virtue of the fact that it had the property not all going to the veterans if they would have been in the position to get it at the same price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.717" offset="10606864">So that -- that there are other elements of damages which we point out on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.910" offset="10627553">Now, one of the damages, that we wanted to go to the priority holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.602" offset="10642390">We didn't want to go to other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.449" offset="10653780">And there was no -- there's nothing in here to say that any nonpriority holders got -- received any vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.401" offset="10681574">As a matter of fact, I -- I'm sorry I just thought to go outside of the record that I want.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.404" offset="10709577">The fact is that, as far as this complaint is because this answer is concerned, all of the vehicles went to priority holders and those who were masquerading such as the plaintiff, the defendant here as priority holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.238" offset="10760882">So that we were damaged in the -- to the extent that we're going to people whom -- to whom we didn't want to sell the property to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.194" offset="10792751">And they were -- they were getting it by this masquerade of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.288" offset="10805081">Secondly, as Mr. Justice Reed pointed out in Helvering and Mitchell, the Government was -- the Court held that the 50% addendum there was -- was compensatory because the Government is entitled to recover for the cause of investigating and ferreting of the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.978" offset="10895882">We were -- we encountered the same problems here of how much money was expended on ferreting out this fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.439" offset="10921691">You can't find out that the Government's, it's just one of this things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.638" offset="10938514">It happens, the fraud is ferreted out, but you don't allocate money to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.837" offset="10955337">And it's all -- all this is -- are elements of damages which we suffered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.249" offset="10976967">I'd like to point out, if the Court please, that in Marcus and Hess -- in Marcus and Hess there were 56 contracts to which the -- the penalty of, if you want to call it penalty, of $2000 was -- was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.558" offset="11038198">Of that 56 contracts, eight of them there was no damage at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.872" offset="11063484">The fraud had been caught at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.107" offset="11080411">There were fraudulent bids submitted but the -- before any money was paid out on it, before anything was done, the fraud was detected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.115" offset="11120431">So that note that the Government then suffered no damage in -- in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2906.804" offset="11627207">The fact is, I think, that everybody knows that in 1947, at this time, there was a shortage of all sorts of motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.128" offset="11668480">The fact is, I know personally, I had to wait about 15 months before I can get a -- could get a – obtain a passenger car.</text>
