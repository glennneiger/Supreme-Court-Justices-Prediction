            <text syncTime="32.214" offset="128836">Before proceeding with argument in this case, I would like to explain one or two of the reasons why I filed a brief amicus in this case and ultimately requested time to be heard orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.104" offset="192366">New Hampshire was requested to do this by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.640" offset="218488">As Attorney General of New Hampshire, I have been in charge of a legislative investigation as the delegated committee, so to speak, for the last two years, to determine whether there were any violations of the Subversive Activities Act of our State, and to report to the general court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.691" offset="298736">In the process of conducting that investigation, one of the witnesses that was called, filed a petition with our Supreme Court asking that the subversive activities (Inaudible) New Hampshire of 1951 be declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.990" offset="359863">That Act is patented after the Maryland over law and is very similar to the acts in perhaps 15 of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.813" offset="407197">It is also worthy of note in connection with this brief that has been filed amicus, that every Attorney General in the United States, in every State which has a law of any proportion in the field of subversive activities has joined in this brief with the exception of the Attorney General of Texas, who filed his own briefs which argues very much, I believe, the same propositions as are contained in the brief for the State of New Hampshire.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.002" offset="924003">I don't know if I can state it in a sentence or two, but very briefly, our law -- our law is very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.642" offset="946469">It is aimed at subversive advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.985" offset="959843">That is the acts themselves, either teaching, aiding or abetting the actual overthrow of the Government of the Federal Government or of the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.582" offset="994325">It is also aimed at subversive organizations as such which are defined as organizations which have for one of their purposes, the overthrow of the Government of either by force and violence, if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.033" offset="1052108">And that it is also aimed at persons, who are members in such organizations, but at all times only including the element of scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.153" offset="1088575">They must be members knowing of the subversive purpose and that is a question of fact for the jury.Our Supreme Court on January, I believe, 25th, 1954, held our state statute constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.562" offset="1154194">And on that day, they had filed with it the copy of Justice Jones' opinion in the principal case and a copy of Justice Bell's dissenting opinion, and a supplemental memorandum by counsel for the original petitioner in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.837" offset="1219291">And a supplemental memorandum was filed by myself.And when they decided the case on April 30th of 1954, they had fully explored the question of whether or not our law in New Hampshire was superseded by, in their opinion, the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.397" offset="1289509">And they held flatly, that insofar as the opinion of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania purported to say that the Smith Act superseded state law that “We do not adopt it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="337.608" offset="1350426">Our Court in New Hampshire has quite a reputation since the days of Justice Jeremiah Smith and Chief Justice (Inaudible), with an outstanding court.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.000" offset="1383967">I think it worthy of mention that there is a flat disagreement between the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, after full consideration of the issues in the Highest Court of Pennsylvania in respect to this issue of supersession.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.424" offset="3485675">And the matter of the Internal Security Act of 1950, while it is contended reflects upon congressional intent in 1940, in a retroactive sense over some 10 sessions of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1138.606" offset="4554397">But if supersession by implication should be announced as a doctrine in a field of an implied power under the Constitution such as this, the test then becomes one of whether or not Congress having occupied the field or there being such a conflict which there is not, which the Government brief, the Solicitor General's brief at page 10 says that for 15 years, the States and the Federal Government had cooperated in this field to the mutual advantage and mutual strength of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.272" offset="4693055">And at page 32, the Government's brief urges this Court not to make a finding of conjectural hypothetical difficulties or conflicts between the State and the Federal Government because it is to be presumed that the cooperation which has existed for 15 years will continue to exist in the future.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles F. Barber</label>
            <text syncTime="1947.292" offset="7789087">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.081" offset="7804238">I appear as counsel for the United States, pursuant to the invitation of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.887" offset="7831510">Based on the study of the Smith Act, its legislative history and the precedence of this Court in the general field of preemption, it is our view that it was not the purpose of Congress in enacting the Smith Act to supersede or suspend the operation of the state sedition statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.621" offset="7910400">For that reason, I am appearing on the side of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.667" offset="7934642">I should add that we take an issue only -- we take a position only on the issue of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.589" offset="7962331">We think that that is the only issue before this Court, certainly, it is if this Court follows its usual principles in reviewing cases which come up in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.805" offset="8015203">We take no position on the various Fourteenth Amendment issues which the court below indicated (Inaudible) in his record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.810" offset="8051148">They, of course, would be a right for consideration by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania if the -- this Court reverses and remands the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.622" offset="8102452">There's nothing I can add to the statement of the petitioner's affirmative case which has already been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.463" offset="8145816">Accordingly, I'll confine my remarks to a few of the questions which have been touched on by the Court in the course of the argument and the questions which are urged by respondent as grounds for affirming the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.777" offset="8215092">These fall generally in three areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.222" offset="8228885">First, the nature of the federal interest which touches on the material which Mr. Justice Frankfurter was last questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.340" offset="8277264">The bearing of the fact that this state legislation arises in an area whereas this Court has stressed the delicate balance is to be maintained between the public safety on the one hand and civil rights, personal freedoms on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.103" offset="8344346">And finally, the effect of the possibility of the so-called double punishment which Mr. Justice Frankfurter questioned a few minutes ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.287" offset="8393143">The Federal Government recognizes, of course, that as applied at least to the Communist conspiracy, as we know it and as was described by this Court in Dennis, the national interest in protecting the integrity of constitutional government of the United States is supreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.096" offset="8460330">It is paramount to any interest of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.040" offset="8472137">It may not be an interest that is different in kind because as the Attorney General in New Hampshire stressed, the States and the Federal Government in a very real sense in terms of the objectives of this conspiracy are in the same boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.711" offset="8534831">However, the United States as the Government of all, and under the Constitution, within the range of its powers, its laws are supreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.177" offset="8584673">Respondent argues in his brief very strenuously that it is only sedition against the United States which is involved and not sedition against the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.864" offset="8627409">He presses this hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.012" offset="8632007">He says it's immaterial at page 55 of his brief, that subversion against the United States will vitally affect the States or may bring injury from them, again in arguing this problem of double punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.455" offset="8693760">He says the case would be different if the respondent were convicted of sedition against this charge and convicted of sedition against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.208" offset="8760738">This indeed, I think, I'm fair in saying is the theme of respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.527" offset="8794070">Technically, I'm not sure that his position is sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.389" offset="8809535">As Mr. Truscott pointed out yesterday, the indictment in this case charges sedition against the State of Pennsylvania and against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.465" offset="8857809">And the judgment below was to quash the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.294" offset="8873169">Perhaps, that puts an issue only in the allegations of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.117" offset="8888424">Practically, as Mr. Wyman has just argued, the proposition is unrealistic in the extreme in terms of the Communist conspiracy.But in any event, for purposes of deciding the question in issue here, we submit that it makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.881" offset="8979435">This Court has made it clear that the power of a State to punish advocacy of any sort is under the Fourteenth Amendment, a very narrow power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.315" offset="9033247">As Mr. Justice Brandeis said, in concurring in the conviction of Ms. Whitney under the California statute, the power exists where there's evidence of conspiracy or incitement to permit present serious crimes or as Mr. Justice Sanford said in the Gilbert case, it may be which involved the Minnesota statute of prohibiting advocacy or interference of interference with enlistment in the United States forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.526" offset="9170024">The statute may be invoked simply in the exertion of the simple police power of the State to preserve public order at the time and place of the utterances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.202" offset="9216731">For purposes of this sort of exertion of the power of the State under these statutes, we don't think it makes any difference whether the formal object of the conspiracy is said to be the United States Government, said to be the State Government or said to be Government generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.893" offset="9311504">Indeed we think it would be extraordinary for Congress to seek to displace state laws where they are invoked in such a -- a basic exertion of the police power as these examples are suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.059" offset="9384229">One of the factors relied on by the Court below was the assumption that the enforcement of these statutes would be hampering to the exercise of federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.936" offset="9447654">In our brief, we stated the fact that in the view of the responsible enforcement officials of the Department of Justice, they have not, to date, they have not obstructed the exercise of that power.</text>

            <text syncTime="4681.102" offset="18724362">Now, returning to this issue of supersession, it's our basic position here that the federal interest in the subject matter is -- is so as such and it -- it is so dominant and the -- the nature of the problem is such that's -- once the Federal Government has undertaken to make some legislation on this subject, that legislation then must become exclusive, must become exclusive, ipso facto, exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.442" offset="18857691">That involves, first, I suppose is an examination of the nature of the power which we just are concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4722.989" offset="18891860">No one denies that the power is of -- the powers are being exercised here to protect the Federal Government from sedition, springs from the various, very highest of sources Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution provides for the common defense and general welfare is one base of the power here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.094" offset="18956330">Another is Article 4, Section 4, guaranteeing the States a Republican form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4744.670" offset="18978586">Justice Frankfurter in the Dennis case, indeed the whole court in the Dennis case, gave specific recognition to the very high nature of the power being exercised from the Government -- Federal Government undertakes to proscribe sedition, springing from the very roots of sovereignty, I think is one of the phrases used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.721" offset="19054864">The Government has stated in its brief and the States have not disputed, the proposition that the national interest in its -- in its subject is obviously paramount.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.708" offset="19094779">Further, that the problem is a national problem which caused resolution on the national scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.190" offset="19120692">That -- that sets off the type of power here which is here being exercised from other types of power, for instance, the power under the Commerce -- Commerce Clause in which the supersession issues are most usually raised, posing it as a much -- that there's a power with much higher nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.657" offset="19198537">In addition, we have entanglements or considerations of foreign relations and foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.111" offset="19232392">This Court in the Dennis case has again pointed out those considerations, the foreign policy considerations in respect to any attempt to proscribe sedition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.382" offset="19269486">The Government in -- in its brief here, the Federal Government in its brief here and in -- in its brief in the Dennis case was very explicit in finding out the foreign relation aspects of any attempt to deal with sedition in present day and -- and present times.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.366" offset="19353391">As a matter of fact, the Congress when it passed the 1950 Internal Security of the 1954 Communist Control Act, specifically enumerated various foreign relation aspects of the problem in its preamble to these pieces of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.982" offset="19419847">Finally, another consideration funneling up to the source of the power that's being here exercised, is the -- the civil liberty aspects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.650" offset="19450567">We are dealing here with sedition which is advocacy or speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.390" offset="19469479">It isn't acts of violence or -- or physical acts of sabotage or so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.365" offset="19493407">It involves speech making, avocations of various source, which is in the realm of First Amendment protections requiring that the Attorney General has stated, “A very delicate balancing of various considerations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.549" offset="19566132">The First Amendment protections on the one hand, protections against the -- protection of the national security on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.397" offset="19593509">However in any event, balances or balances things which should be undertaken, I should think by the Federal Government and not by 48 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.995" offset="19627886">It should be undertaken on -- on uniform single basis rather on a diversified multiple basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.240" offset="19668950">Thus -- thus we are -- thus in speaking of the power that has here been exercised, we are on an entirely different plane and in an -- an entirely different category from the usual supersession case where we're worried about the -- the right of the States to label cans or to -- to make regulations of its highways or to undertake any of the other usual traditional state functions under its state police powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.349" offset="19785352">Indeed, I think it's very questionable that it can be said that the State is exercising any traditional state police power when it attempts to proscribe sedition against the United States as distinguished from sedition against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.203" offset="19848777">As noted by the concurring opinion below, sedition against the United States is not a local offense, it is a crime against the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.517" offset="19878034">Traditionally, police power is exercised in respect to matters of local interest or local concerns, never has it exercised in respect to matters which are the concern of neighboring States of all of the States or citizens of all of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.465" offset="19929757">And that is precisely what was done here, when any State attempts to legislate in respect to sedition against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.602" offset="19958387">So I think it can be a question that we had even a field in which the State is exercising traditionally an aspect of its police power, at least insofar as sedition against the United States is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="5606.498" offset="22425913">In a majority decision of opinion written by Justice Washington, the Court held that the Pennsylvania law was not invalid but it did so by construing the Pennsylvania law, that is very important because the case is -- is a difficult one to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.696" offset="22502713">That it did so, solely by construing the Pennsylvania law to be one which authorized a state militia to prosecute under the federal law and the majority opinion as well as the dissent of Justice Story was very emphatic, very emphatic that had the State attempted to enact the identical federal law and prescribed its own penalties and enforce it in the state courts or in the state court marshall, but then the law would have to fall under the theory of federal supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.057" offset="22648163">On that -- on that holding, on that reasoning is identical to the situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.683" offset="22674704">Here we have two criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.734" offset="22682854">In the Houston versus Moore, there's a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.041" offset="22692153">Here we have a criminal statute.So this -- this distinguishment between regulation and criminal statute is no quite conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.320" offset="22729247">There, the criminal statute -- the federal power is being exercised in the paramount federal field.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.397" offset="22749518">That was brought out in the course of both minority -- minority and majority decision -- opinions there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5693.519" offset="22774073">And there, it was held, specifically, by all -- all of the justices that had the Act -- the Pennsylvania Act, attempted to -- to proscribe or prescribe the identical federal offense, making it a state crime and enforced it with its own -- or furnished it with its own penalties, and then -- then the law would have to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.696" offset="22854740">And it was further stated that the Pennsylvania law could be sustained only if Congress specifically indicated its consent that the State should assist in -- in the federal -- in -- in enforcing the federal law with respect to enlistments in the federal militia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5734.293" offset="22937078">Hines versus Davidowitz is a -- another case upon which we rely heavily.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.533" offset="22958080">There we have the foreign relations that there -- that, of course, was the alien and sedition case in which the state sedition laws and I think there were some 19 were superseded in that case were held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5753.550" offset="23014191">First, by reason of the superior or dominant nature of -- of the dominant federal interest in the subject matter and second, because of the element of civil liberties involved to the personal rights and freedoms, which it was the primary responsibility of the Congress to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.264" offset="23101022">Hines is therefore very relevant here on those two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.311" offset="23125159">And as -- as I indicated the fact that there were a number of States which had -- also had alien laws did not deter this Court and decide us from defining federal supremacy.+</text>
            <text syncTime="5793.928" offset="23175628">I think it's significant to note those same alien and sedition laws which were the subject of the litigation on the Hines case also contains the identical sedition provisions that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5809.397" offset="23237486">Title 1, I think, contained the alien -- the alien clause and Title 3 contained the same identical sedition law, this 1940 Smith Act that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.296" offset="23281162">There's one body of law at that time since it's been recodified into separate sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5830.354" offset="23321391">These -- these courts -- and even in the cases where there is no big dominant federal interest and where the State is legislating in a field which is traditionally its own, that is under its traditional state police powers, this Court has many times held that the States cannot enact identical -- identical legislation and prescribe different or heavier or lighter penalties on the theory that once Congress has enacted a law specifically under an exercise of its -- one of its powers, the States simply cannot be permitted to enact this, the identical law.</text>
