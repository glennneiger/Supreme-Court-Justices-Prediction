            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="11.388" offset="45453">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.271" offset="57051">This case is here from the Tenth Circuit and it's the second of the series of cases that involved this parking lot question which we were discussing yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.125" offset="108460">Here as in the case which we discussed or argued yesterday, the question is whether this nonemployee union organizers are entitled under the Labor Act to distribute (Inaudible), Your Honor, on parking lot word is unreasonably difficult to make such distribution in the immediate vicinity of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.932" offset="195709">The facts, if I may summarize quite briefly, are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.883" offset="219429">The company here operates a plant on the outskirts of Holdenville, Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.285" offset="245133">Holdenville has a population of about 6000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.164" offset="264568">The company has a breaking force of about 200 workers and these 200 workers, some 40% of them live in Holdenville or -- excuse me, two thirds of these 200 employees live in Holdenville and the remaining one-third live within a radius in and around Holdenville of five to 10 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.881" offset="371461">Again, in this case, there is virtually no public transportation to and from the plant and as a result, the employers ride to work in private automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.905" offset="415556">They -- record discloses that normally.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.629" offset="426423">They do not stop anywhere in the vicinity of the plant as they come to work but that they drive directly from the highway which is adjacent -- which is adjacent to the plant property onto a private road and the private road leads into the parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.969" offset="495804">The parking lot is located about a distance, I would guess from the map of somewhere around 150 somewhat feet between 100, perhaps, 150 feet from the plant proper and when the employees park their cars in the plant parking lot, they cross over from the plant parking lot over into the plant proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.726" offset="582844">The record also discloses that the employees normally do not stop when they leave the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.853" offset="607399">They leave the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.344" offset="613355">They get -- walk to the -- walk to the parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.157" offset="624536">They get into their cars and they drive along private road, inside the plant area onto to the public highway and then onto their homes, somewhere else it maybe going.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.785" offset="667063">Now, on a typical day, the record also discloses that these 200 workers leave in about 80 automobiles and that these automobiles driving at speeds ranging from five to 20 miles per hour here at the plant area in a matter of five to 10 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.424" offset="749610">In 1953, the union here was seeking to organize the company's employees and on several occasions, the representatives of the union went to the plant and station themselves at the edge of the parking lot and as the employers came out of their automobiles, they sought to either talk to them or to distribute literature to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.076" offset="848248">The company's representatives noticed this and ordered the union representatives to leave the place because they were trespassing on his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.140" offset="888477">This in some -- these and some are the facts in this case on which the Board found that it was because of the employees nonstop method of driving to and from the plant to the immediate vicinity of plant that it was unreasonably difficult for the union organizers to reach these employees for the purposes of distributing literature or the -- for the purpose of soliciting union membership in the immediate vicinity of the plant to the public area and the immediate vicinity of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.580" offset="1006237">And that accordingly, the employers forbidding the union representative to distribute literature on the plant parking lot constituted a serious impediment to the employees' right to receive organization literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.282" offset="1069035">And it found that the employer's ousting or prohibition against the distribution of literature on the plant parking lot, as in the other case, constituted interference with the meaning of Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="278.887" offset="1115533">And accordingly as in the other cases, it indirect the employer to permit the union representatives to distribute literature on the plant parking lot subject to reasonable and nondiscriminatory regulations in the interest of prime efficiency and discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.511" offset="1194005">The court below did not disturb, when this case came before, it did not disturb the Board's finding that the employees' nonstop method of driving to and from the plant made it unreasonably difficult for the union representatives to reach the employees for the purpose of distributing literature in the immediate vicinity of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.990" offset="1283866">It held however or rejected the Board's finding that an unfair labor practice had been committed here for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.857" offset="1315422">First, that these representatives who sought to distribute literature were strangers to the employees' rights under the Act, the employees' right of self-organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.912" offset="1359621">And secondly, that the employees were easily accessible in the nearby town of Holdenville, which I've indicated had a population of about 6000 -- 6000 and where two thirds of the 200 employees live.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.561" offset="1426181">I should like to address myself to the two considerations which this Court in agreement of where the Fifth Circuit in the case, which we discussed yesterday, felt more decisive and felt precluded, the adjustment which precluded or militated against the adjustment which the Board had made here between the competing interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.765" offset="1507056">The first of this is the -- these -- these representatives are strangers to the employees' rights of self-organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.348" offset="1545300">We think that this conclusion rest upon the erroneous premise, the communication between trained organizers -- organizers, union organizers and the employees is not an incident of the rights which the Act infers upon the employees themselves for purposes of self-organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.398" offset="1621577">This Court in the Thomas versus Collins case had occasion to note that included in the bundle of rights, which he act confers upon the employees, is the right to be informed concerning union matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.590" offset="1678315">And that he correlative of that right, this Court continued in that case, is the right of the union to reach the employees and to inform them and to distribute literature to them concerning organizational matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.023" offset="1852082">Now, it seems to us that whether the literature is distributed by outsiders or by the employees themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.549" offset="1886145">In either case, what is fundamental at stake here contrary to the view of the court below and contrary to the view of the Fifth Circuit that what is fundamental at stake here is the employees' right to receive organizational literature.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.071" offset="1956258">The Court here thought that because the employees were accessible in the nearby town -- where easily accessible in its own words, in the nearby town of Holdenville that the -- in prohibition against the distribution of literature on the plant parking lot did not constitute a serious impediment to the employees' exercise of this right to receive organizational literature and to be informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.419" offset="2049672">Now, it seems to us that this decision and I'm trying to answer your question, Mr. Justice Reed, as I -- in -- in this context, it seems to us that what the Court has overlooked is the critical factor that the natural -- the most effective and the most important place for the distribution of literature to employees, the place where there can be any kind of systematic distribution of the literature where the employees, who will receive it will get the full benefit of it, is at the plant area before they scatter to the four corners.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.866" offset="2179448">There, the employees are able to answer -- to ask questions at the organizers or able to confer with their fellow employees as to the significance of this literature and it seems to -- and as against that, as against that although the employers are not wholly inaccessible, as the Court said -- as the court below said, are not wholly inaccessible in the nearby town.</text>

            <text syncTime="1228.828" offset="4915304">Now, it seems to us that it might well be said of union organizers who seek to reach employees in a plant park -- who seek to reach employees in a lumber camp or in a mining camp where they both work and live that they too are -- are trespassers and yet, I think, we are all agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.999" offset="4987925">In fact, the decisions of this Court, I think, foreshadow this conclusion that those outside organizers would be entitled to have access to those employees at the -- in these lumber camps because, otherwise, the employees' right to exercise their rights under their statute, the employees' right to be informed concerning their rights would be seriously handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.872" offset="5075487">And the test, we think, is, we apply in these cases, is the test which the Sixth Circuit laid down in that Lake Superior case and that is whether -- then that is, what in fact would be the prejudice to the interest of the employer and permitting access and what would be the benefit to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.827" offset="5163259">And whether the benefit prevailed over the prejudice or the prejudice prevailed over the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.219" offset="5184784">Now, here as I sought to indicate yesterday, it seems to us that the detriment which the employer suffers, if these organizers distribute literature on the plant parking lot hardly arises to more than the mere inconvenience which this Court said in the -- hardly arises to anymore than the kind of inconvenience that this Court said he could be subjected to in the LeTourneau case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.019" offset="5291990">On the other hand, the detriment to the employees is particularly serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.208" offset="5312784">And it's particularly -- it's even more serious when they are denied access to these outside organizers than to what might be the case if they were denied communication as among themselves because these trained organizers as we know are specialists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.502" offset="5369940">They are trained in this kind of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.464" offset="5377776">They are frequently the employee's best sources of information with the respect to this union matters and to the extent that an employer unreasonably forecloses otherwise appropriate avenues of communication and thereby forecloses the employees from tapping the experience and the organizational know-how of these experts to that extent, the employers' rights are diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.127" offset="5496477">The argument is also advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.577" offset="5510269">I think Mr. Mueller will undoubtedly make it and I'd like to anticipate it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.499" offset="5537959">The argument is also advanced that here, and this is particularly true in the next case, that there was no prohibition against the employees themselves distributing the literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.678" offset="5590622">And that the union organizers could have handed out the literature to these employees who in turn could have gone onto -- into the parking lot and distribute the literature to their fellow employees in the parking lot and thereby have this information available to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.719" offset="5650808">Our answer to that contention, Your Honor, is, if the Court please, our -- our answer to that is that these trained organizers that I said a moment ago are the best sources of information for the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.032" offset="5716114">And when that literature is distributed, undoubted the literature, will often evoke questions from the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.448" offset="5741714">And it seems to us that unless the answers are readily forthcoming at the times the literature is distributed that the effectiveness of the literature will be largely dissipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.715" offset="5782779">In addition to that, it is not always easy to obtain employees to distribute literature, particularly in the initial stages of an organizational campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.323" offset="5821231">Understandably, the employees might be reluctant to appear in the role of spearheading, an organizational campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.703" offset="5850802">And for these reasons, we feel that it is not enough to say that these organizers could have handed the literature to the employees themselves who in turn could have distributed the literature to their fellow employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.294" offset="5953097">It didn't reach the problem of what the result would have been if there had been no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.616" offset="5974413">And, of course, here in this -- in these cases just as in the LeTourneau, there is no claim that the rule is a discriminatory rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.671" offset="6002625">In other words, that it was intended to prejudice the union in the sense that an employer, say, discharging employees or punishing them for engaging union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.030" offset="6052049">The rule is not motivated by discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.672" offset="6070648">That -- the -- the Stowe case is significant, I think, in this connection just as the LeTourneau cases and also the Marsh verus Alabama case, which involved the distribution of literature by the Jehovah Witnesses in a company own town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.160" offset="6124565">It is significant in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.285" offset="6137104">As the Court said there that the employer's mere dominion or mere control over his property rights is not necessarily decisive or controlling of the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.280" offset="6185064">In Stowe, as well as in LeTourneau and as well as in Marsh versus Alabama, the Court said that the protection to be accorded to statutory rights, not unlike the protection to be accorded to constitutional rights, may appropriately require the subordination of the employer's naked proprietary interest to the effective exercise of those rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1583.474" offset="6333858">At the outset, if I may, I should like to review very briefly some of the facts here presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.370" offset="6373460">Some of which had been touched upon by our Brother for the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.306" offset="6421211">The respondent is engaged in conduct that of a manufacturing business on a track of land of some 25 acres on the outskirts of an Oklahoma town, Holdenville, a place of some 6000 folk as Mr. Manoli has entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.502" offset="6557989">We placed in evidence and have in the record before the Court a plot of a property on which our factory building is situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.378" offset="6621414">It appears at page 93 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.862" offset="6663419">Reference to that plot will indicate that the company's property is bounded by two public thorough repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.098" offset="6712320">The one on the south being denominated the airport road, it will be observe that that's a dead-end road, and the one on the east or the front side of the factory building, if the Court please, which is also a dead -- dead-end thorough repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.101" offset="6836349">Now, we don't mean to indicate by calling attention to these facts that we think that this case turns on facts such as this, but we point to them because of the emphasis and appearance significance that the Board attaches to different facts in the case which preceded this one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1810.981" offset="7243860">These roads, the record shows and incidentally these facts to which I will allude are all undisputed, we don't have any question of fact resolution at all, our area of conflict last completely within the -- a matter of conclusions to be drawn from the facts proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.438" offset="7337691">It was suggested yesterday and facts in these cases are all about the same and we were not favored with a brief by the Board and I -- I don't say that critically or by way of complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.575" offset="7398296">The Board didn't brief the facts of our case but instead referred to its brief in the Babcock case and suggested simply that the questions there presented are the same as those here presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.492" offset="7469871">We most respectfully, but nonetheless, positively disagree with that suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.473" offset="7509891">This is one small facet of fact where the cases are not alike and in saying that I don't mean to turn my back on my Brother Fisher or on his client Babcock or Wilcox.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.011" offset="7576033">I think that his situation is one that speaks for itself and that it sound on its own facts but those facts, I suggest, are different from those here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.331" offset="7625247">For example, in the course of the argument in that case and I won't labor this too long, counsel for the Board suggested that in the Babcock case the employees entered upon highways where there were no parking signs that would prevent people from stopping and where the speed limit was 65 miles an hour, which would indicate the people could drive along in such fashion that it might be difficult for them to be estopped in time to be in importune by one who would like to sell a union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.638" offset="7774459">In short contrast to those facts, we have these dead-end roads which come down one to the airport and the other in front of our property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.574" offset="7818240">The facts are, and the record is undisputed on this, that these roads are lightly traveled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.945" offset="7863693">Now, it is interesting to ask because of the emphasis that the Board places on unlike facts in other cases that our little old parking lot is just a graveled area behind our factory building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.211" offset="7932761">It isn't fenced off from the plant area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.441" offset="7957734">When the employees, most of them are women, drive their cars onto the parking lots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.741" offset="7986887">They simply parked them on this graveled area designated private parking, utilizing the private road across our property to get there and they then go into the employee's entrance at the back of the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.953" offset="8083749">None of this property is open to use by the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.046" offset="8104124">So, we immediately distinguished this case on its facts from the holding of the Seventh Circuit in Marshall Field in respect to Holdenville court which was there found to partake of the nature of a public street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.162" offset="8164624">It turned pretty much on the question of discrimination as we view that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.145" offset="8200568">When a person gains access to our parking lot, they've got access to our factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.775" offset="8219063">We don't have any gig houses and we don't have any guards as -- or to be found in some of these other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.911" offset="8275592">What we are dealing with here is a "No Trespassing" rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.094" offset="8304327">We posted this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.024" offset="8312059">We just got a barbwire fence surround the outside of it with no gates at the entrances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.592" offset="8342361">But we posted our property as we used that term sometimes down or part of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.014" offset="8363990">We put up large signs, notices to the public that trespassing on our property was not permitted and that the roadways to the parking lots were private.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.937" offset="8415713">Broadway is not open to public use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.116" offset="8432431">We don't' mean to quibble for an instant with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.136" offset="8448522">The Board said that there was a distinction without a difference when we suggested that a "No Trespassing" rule and I know distribution, I know solicitation rule were not one of the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.473" offset="8497842">The Board reason that a "No Trespassing" rule would keep a nonemployee or stranger off our property and consequence, it would prohibit him or prevent him from distributing and soliciting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.562" offset="8554162">We're bound to agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.554" offset="8582165">It has been conceded by counsel and we're grateful to him that there's no question presented in this case concerning our motivation in adopting the "No Trespassing" rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.109" offset="8652382">We did it in pursuance of our rights in connection with the ownership and use of our private property and the Board hasn't called in the question, our motive, for posting our property and for preventing or forbidding trespassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.877" offset="8735451">And neither is there any question at all about the -- evenhandedness with which that rule has been enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.118" offset="8772441">It has been nondiscriminatorily enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.252" offset="8796996">The record does not show that we had any rule which prohibits or in anyway interferes with employees in the exercise of their rights to self-organization under the Act on our property during nonworking time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.125" offset="8876408">The case boils down solely and simply to a question of whether or not, under the facts of our case, nonemployee organizers have an enforceable legal right at the hands of the Board to take and to use our property in connection with their attempts to sell their wares, namely, union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.580" offset="8998243">We find no fault with their cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.089" offset="9008274">It's not within our problems to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.159" offset="9024575">It isn't -- whether it's good or bad but as has been suggested by members of the Court, the question that bears so heavily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.880" offset="9067520">In our thinking is where is the appropriate place for these nonemployees to communicate with our employees in an effort to prevail upon them to take membership in the particular labor organization of which that nonemployee organizer is in turn an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.004" offset="9195938">We think that under the law, we are required not to interfere with or to restrain or to coerce employees in connection with the exercise of their rights and there's no contention that we have unless, indeed, the nondiscriminatory enforcement of our "No Trespassing" rule has cut them off from the services of these alleged experts in the intricacies of labor law in connection with the employees' exercise of their rights on the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.086" offset="9368242">It's of no consequence but I can't resist the temptation to observe that I don't think that the American worker be he man or woman is so lacking in understanding of what's going on in connection with labor organization in the last 20 odd years that he boards along epithetic and ignorant of his rights and the opportunities that await him if he desires to avail himself of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.320" offset="9525185">This union is not the representative of any of our employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.531" offset="9538038">There's no contention that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.096" offset="9544307">So, the case is involving access to tankers for representatives of collective bargaining agents where the union has state us under the law as such are completely beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.313" offset="9601149">The case stands here in a setting, completely free of unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.758" offset="9622988">It isn't suggested that we have done anything at all in contravention of the law except to enforce our nondiscriminatory "No Trespassing" rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.272" offset="9661022">Now, the Board has told us that we must rescind that rule and that we must accord full access to nonemployee union organizers to our properly for use by them in carrying on their organizational activities subject only, and the Board gratuitously conversed this on us which we think it undertook to borrow from LeTourneau, subject only to such reasonable controls as we may make as -- and nondiscriminatory reasonable regulations as we may make that will, excuse me, ensure plant efficiency and maintain discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.095" offset="9900304">Both of which, we suggest, make sense when they're related to employee-employer but no sense whatsoever when related to a landowner as the respondent in this case and a stranger who would enter upon and use his profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.053" offset="9976163">In this case, the order goes farther than it does in the case which precedes it in the one which follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.069" offset="10008242">In those cases, no distribution rules were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.745" offset="10026945">Ours is to brought "No Trespassing" rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.222" offset="10044813">And in consequence of that, the Board has not only told us that we've got to let these people on our property for the purpose of distributing literature but for the purpose of soliciting union memberships and that opens a vastly wider field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.045" offset="10112104">That brings on the area of discussion without question and raises problems that the order and the decision and nowise suggest an answer, how many maybe gathered together at one time and solicited and where.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.669" offset="10178664">And in that connection, as a practical matter and -- and we do have to be practical in connection with our attempt to operate our business, the area which the Board order would require us to open up and turn over to these nonemployee organizers is not only the parking lot behind the building but the area between that park lot and the threshold to our backdoor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.255" offset="10292976">It come up right on our back doorstep, if you please, and take that order as a forum from which to advance their arguments to employees in respect to whatever message they have to deliver in connection with unionization and organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.877" offset="10411468">We respectfully submit that it certainly isn't incumbent upon us under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.326" offset="10441247">Now, it is it conferred upon the Board by the Act to require us to provide that forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.721" offset="10486805">In analyzing the Board's order, we find it bottomed on two grounds principally, one, the alleged virtual impossibility of communicating with our employees off our property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.625" offset="10558485">And here, may I take note of the fact that only since the petition for certiorari was filed in this Court have we had engrafted on the question in this case accessibility within the immediate vicinity of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.729" offset="10622851">Counsel alluded to that several times in the course of his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.795" offset="10639151">That question wasn't litigated before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.702" offset="10650749">It wasn't before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.887" offset="10663497">It's never been contended, prior to the advent of the case in this Court that accessibility has to be in the immediate vicinity of the plant, otherwise, the plant property must be condemned to the use of outside nonemployee organizers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.615" offset="10758374">The court below correctly found, we think, that the Board's conclusion that it was impossible or virtually impossible or unreasonably difficult to communicate with our employees off our property was a conclusion to use Judge Murrah's language that is not legally justified by the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.215" offset="10852833">He had put the record to the test for that Court applying the rules laid down by this Court in Universal Camera and he found the Board's conclusion wanting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.193" offset="10904764">There was no support in the record taken as a whole that it was virtually impossible to communicate with our employees off our property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.513" offset="10946038">And we think that when this Court comes to examine the record, it is bound to reach that same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.529" offset="10978116">The Board's finding rest on the flimsy pretext.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.032" offset="10992118">Maybe I shouldn't call it that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.565" offset="11006224">Flimsy argument let me say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.163" offset="11016568">That would be more polite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.144" offset="11036526">That number one, these employees live in Holdenville, two thirds of them in Holdenville and the balance of them within five or 10 miles at Holdenville and that the employees don't stop ordinarily when they come to work or leave work in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.141" offset="11120536">And let me take just a minute to tell the Court what the record shows with respect to this so-called nonstop driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.828" offset="11155226">A couple of girls went out to the plant one afternoon, two years ago this month as I recall it, to observe what happened when the employees left, and we only operate one shift, the girls go home around 4:00 or 4:30, they got into their cars, they drove around to the north end of the building out for the access road and on toward town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.893" offset="11263478">They testified that most of them were bumper to bumper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.764" offset="11279047">They all got off at the same time and then no one stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.820" offset="11311229">But the thing that seems to us absurd, if I may use that term, is the undenied fact that there wasn't anything suggestion that there was any reason for him to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.445" offset="11357727">No one invited them to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.686" offset="11370684">No one asked them to stop to receive literature or to stop for any other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.093" offset="11404330">And because of that happening on that one day in the afternoon, the trial examiners, whose findings were adopted by the Board, drew the inference they came to work the same way in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.226" offset="11460859">I don't think they do but they probably don't stop upon entering upon our property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.105" offset="11484369">Absent, there'd be in some reason to stop and I suppose normally there is suppose some.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.151" offset="11516552">And when we undertook to argue before the Board that the record was barren of any showing that the union ever attempted even raised a finger to invite a single soul to stop his car or her car to receive a piece of literature or to engage in conversation concerning unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.002" offset="11643925">And that's the way the record stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.089" offset="11652284">This record is barren of anything to show that the union ever made any attempt except to come upon our property and station themselves on our backstep.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.995" offset="11695961">And there undertake to commandeer what we think would amount to a captive audience, if you please, that no way for the girls to escape on even if they wanted to and I might mentioned in passing there that the Act gives the employees the right to refrain from engaging in these activities as well as the right to engage in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.575" offset="11790211">But the Board with the wave of the hand simply says that it wasn't necessary for the union to make an attempt because of the nonstop method of driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.753" offset="11842978">It's obvious that the attempt would have been futile and aborted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.311" offset="11869205">And so there isn't any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.691" offset="11878713">There isn't any evidence that we ever in anyway interfered with the union organizer, trying to meet our people outside our property on the roadway, in town, at home, in union halls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.727" offset="11950811">All of which had been characterized by the Board members on one occasion or another as time honored and traditional means for communicating their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.619" offset="12010475">And these were the special circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.261" offset="12024999">What these girls saw that one afternoon when our girls left the job and had no reason to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.974" offset="12047882">Those were the special circumstances that cause the examiner and the Board to conclude that it was virtually impossible to distribute literature to our employees or to solicit our employees off company property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.581" offset="12122279">No one did ask that Judge Murrah, speaking for the Tenth Circuit, struck it down and said it's not legally justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.483" offset="12161881">Judge Murrah found correctly, we think, that the employees were easily accessible and I find that I've.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.972" offset="12199811">[Laughs]</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.055" offset="12200124">used all my time on my first point [Laughs].</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.304" offset="12217156">Let me say this if I may.</text>

            <label>Mr. Karl H. Mueller</label>
            <text syncTime="3059.239" offset="12236904">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.867" offset="12247458">That we don't think it's necessary for this Court to go beyond our first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.753" offset="12270968">The Board's order rest on alleged nonaccessibility or inaccessibility off company property and the Board failed to prove that and we think the Tenth Circuit correctly so found and held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.763" offset="12335020">Judge Murrah wrote -- writing for that Court said that there was no impediment amounting to the serious handicap as would be the case in the Lumber Company camp where the man had to live and there was the tenancy aspect and all those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.721" offset="12402834">None of those things are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.799" offset="12411193">None of them even suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.531" offset="12426031">And so the Court concluded that below that our nondiscriminatory enforcement of our "No Trespassing" rule did not constitute an unfair labor practice and it refused to enforce the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.220" offset="12480784">And that brings me very briefly to the second point which I should like discuss in length but probably it wouldn't add anything more than talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.074" offset="12532193">The Board's order is predicated on the patently erroneous assumption that the rights of nonemployees to use our property for organizational purposes is the same as the right of our employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.970" offset="12595827">Now, it'd be presumptuous of me to tell this Court what it held in LeTourneau where everybody knows it's generally conceded by now that that had to do with the employees who were on the property as a matter of right in connection with in pursuance of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.785" offset="12663118">They were in no sense trespassers and Judge Murrah made that observation below that any employee on its employer's property engaging in self-organization does not infringe a "No Trespassing" rule and that's the only rule we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.283" offset="12725081">That's the only one that's in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.988" offset="12739918">We think that this is pure invention of the Board to attempt to extend rules that seem to us reasonable when applied to the governance of the employees during their nonworking time while they are on their employer's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.838" offset="12807314">This Court indicated that a balance had to be struck between discipline on the one hand and property rights on the other and that in those circumstances, that is the employer-employee relationship, it was proper that the employer should have the burden if he wanted to restrict the activities of the employees on his property during their nonworking time to show that the restriction was necessary in terms of maintaining production or preserving discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.435" offset="12917656">And that's the thing that the Board's undertaken to pull out of LeTourneau and apply against us and actually in the decision in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.437" offset="12949734">The Board has said that the burden was on us to approve the necessity for our rule in respect to "No Trespassing", lifted it bodily out of LeTourneau.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.189" offset="13004696">And if Your Honors please, in our case all they did was to say that our contention that the LeTourneau thing applied to employees and that we were here dealing with nonemployees, they said that was a distinction without a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.609" offset="13066344">That's the way it was glossed over and they took one quick look at Thomas against Collins to which references has already been made and said that closes the gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.392" offset="13109499">It follows that LeTourneau stands for the proposition that nonemployees are entitled to enter upon and use an employer's premises for organizational activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.917" offset="13155579">We say that burden, of course, is not on us and we think it's -- it's fantastic really -- pathetic in our point of view to suggest that the balance that was struck in LeTourneau should be struck when we're confronted not with the employer-employee relationship but with the relationship of an employer and a rank stranger who would undertake to sell union memberships to the employees in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.186" offset="13292669">This convenience argument is a devilish one, if I may say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.948" offset="13319732">We have a public address system in our plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.984" offset="13331853">It would be possible to address the employees over that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.219" offset="13344810">That would be more convenient than using the parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.901" offset="13359543">We simply say that the case can't be decided upon that basis and we respectfully submit that the Court of Appeals below was correct on the law in facts and that it should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.290" offset="13413146">Thank you so much.</text>
