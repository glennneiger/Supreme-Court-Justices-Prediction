            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Number 3 on the calendar, United States of America in relation with Audrey M. Toth versus Donald A. Quarles, Secretary of the United States Air Force.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Kehoe, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="27.628" offset="110446">If the Court pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.564" offset="122253">The case at far arose upon the filing of a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.526" offset="166034">We are here before the Court and the case comes before this Court on a writ of certiorari which was granted to the United States -- running to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.932" offset="215667">The facts of the case very briefly stated are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.752" offset="238968">Toth, the prisoner on whose behalf of petition was filed in the District Court is an honorably discharged serviceman.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.325" offset="281287">He was discharged from the United States Air Forces on December 8, 1952.Prior to his discharge, he had served in Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.038" offset="328098">From the time of his discharge on December 8, 1952 up until the present time, Toth was then and is a civilian resident of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.959" offset="383791">As to my understanding that at the present time, he is employed by the City of Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.521" offset="406047">At the time the incidence, which we will allude to in a minute, occurred he was employed in civilian capacity at a steel plant in Pittsburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.753" offset="447007">On April 8, 1953, there was an accusation filed, a sworn accusation filed against Toth by Colonel Hurst, who was attached to the Fifth Air Force in Korea, alleging and accusing Toth of having committed murder and also accusing him of conspiring to commit murder on or about September 27, 1952 at a time prior to his discharge from the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.828" offset="583262">On April 30, 1953, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force ordered the apprehension of Toth and his delivery to the commanding officer of the Fifth Air Force in Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.444" offset="657763">On May 11, 1953, I allude to this fact because of the argument that will subsequently be made about who is Toth's commanding officer or who could have been Toth's commanding officer, should be noted that the Secretary of the Air Force ordered him to be delivered to the Commanding General of the Fifth Air Force on May 11, 1953 according to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.549" offset="754103">The Commanding General of the Continental Air Command at Mitchel Air Force Base in New York ordered the apprehension or arrest of Toth.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.098" offset="800392">On May 13, 1953, Toth was arrested by a major and captain, and three air policemen and as they entered his place of employment in Pittsburgh, he was subsequently transported to Korea.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.655" offset="854518">On May 27, at the time the petition for writ of habeas corpus was filed, Toth was in confinement on the order of the Air Forces in Korea and he was in confinement until September 3, 1953 when the District Court sustained the writ of habeas corpus and ordered his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.881" offset="943438">The issue which is presented to the Court is very broadly stated as whether Congress invalidly enact legislation which would seek the court-martial of a civilian who was not connected with or affiliated in any manner with the Armed Forces and cause such a civilian to be arrested, confined, and transported from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, some 13,000 miles to a foreign country of Korea without any hearing of any type, and there to be held for the purposes of a court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.690" offset="1122743">Our case is broken down into three broad parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.926" offset="1147611">The first part, if we can put it that way is the failure of authority under the Constitution for Congress to enact legislation, looking to the court-martial of a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.177" offset="1212604">The second part is a complete bar in the Constitution under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.985" offset="1239876">And the third part, looking to the uniformed code of military justice itself is that there is a casus omissus in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.544" offset="1278119">I would like to make it very clear to the Court a few general statements that Toth at all times, pertinent to the inquiry here, was a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.443" offset="1325767">He is still a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.865" offset="1335380">At the time he was arrested or apprehended by the Air Force police, he was a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.684" offset="1362651">As I stand before the Court this afternoon, he is a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.976" offset="1379892">If when he was arrested, he had worn or was wearing an Air Force uniform or any part of an Air Force uniform which would connect him with the Air Force, he would have been subject and would be presently subject to criminal prosecution in a civil court.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.384" offset="1465469">That's under our code.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.071" offset="1480202">He had absolutely no connection with the military forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.272" offset="1497025">He was not a member of the reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.372" offset="1505384">He was not a member of any component parts of the Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.061" offset="1520222">He was receiving no benefit from the Air Force.His connection with the Air Force had completely -- been completely severed with his honorable discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.437" offset="1561704">More importantly, he had no commanding officer under any manner, shape or form.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.587" offset="1586260">He was completely and fully a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.421" offset="1601620">There was no officer of the Air Force who could order him to go and he would have to go or to come and he would have to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.275" offset="1637042">There was no one in the Air Force who had any supervision or authority over Toth at all at the time of his apprehension and up until the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.304" offset="1693153">I would also like to allude to the fact and make it very clear that the court-martial procedures, which have been in effect in this country since prior to our Constitution, are in no sense to the word “a judicial procedure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="441.979" offset="1767863">The purpose of the court-martial is not to give justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.578" offset="1786253">The purpose of the court-martial is to summarily punish disobedience among the military forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.225" offset="1824810">This Court has held many years ago that a court-martial and the Army was no -- in nowise a part of the judicial branch of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.997" offset="1871935">That was in Dynes versus Hoover, I think was decided in 1827 and during the course of the Civil War in Ex parte Vallandigham, this Court also alluded to the fact that an appeal from a military commission was not a part of our judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.817" offset="1951242">The purpose of a court-martial is to maintain discipline in the ranks.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.335" offset="1977260">We say that we would like to emphasize that fact because there's been allusions in the Government's brief and allusions as I recall them at the time of the prior argument, that it was a proper function of Congress to pass this Article 3 (a) in the Uniform Code of Military Justice to see that discharged servicemen were meted out justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.001" offset="2067958">Now, that is not the principle or problem of Congress when it enacts regulations for the Government and regulation of the land and naval forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.588" offset="2110276">Once the man is discharged from the service, the land and naval forces has no problem in connection with their punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.713" offset="2150818">And we say again as we said that the -- have said in our brief and said at the time of the previous argument that if the issue which is presented or was presented to Congress was looking to justice then Congress can enact a valid statute which would ensure to an accused the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.193" offset="2240679">The history of court-martial procedures as we know it in this country or in best of my research would apparently commence with the Mutiny Act, which was passed in Great Britain, 1689 at the time that William of Orange mounted to the throne of England and the Irish truce which were -- had served -- were -- were serving in the Army at that time determines the mutiny against his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.230" offset="2372859">The Mutiny Act which was passed in 1689 was for a very brief period of time and it provided for the punishment of soldiers as a court-martial procedure toward mutiny from the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.497" offset="2449972">But it starts off in this fashion, the law of England and whereas “No man may be forejudged of Life or Limbe or subjected to any kinde of punishment by Martiall Law or in any other manner then by the Judgment of his Peeres and according to the knowne and Established Laws of this Realme."</text>
            <text syncTime="632.718" offset="2530847">Yet nevertheless, it being requisite for retaining such forces as are or shall be raised during this exigency of affairs in their duties, an exact discipline be observed, and that soldiers who shall mutiny or stir up sedition, or shall desert the Majesty's service, be brought to a more exemplary and speedy punishment than the usual forms of law shall allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.356" offset="2641398">At the time this Mutiny Act, incidentally, the original Mutiny Act was in existence, I think from April until November.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.148" offset="2688522">It was the intent of the parliament even in those crucial days to see and to make the statement as a part of the Mutiny Act that the jury trial would not be denied even to the soldier, except in the particular case of mutiny or rebellion.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.690" offset="2778697">The Mutiny Act has been in existence I think under various phases and aspects of it in England until 1881.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.396" offset="2813492">At the time of the American Revolution, there was an existence to British Articles of War of 1765.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.490" offset="2881933">To digress for a minute, it has been stated that both the British Army and the American Army during the time of the revolution had the same -- same articles, identical articles for the government of the troops.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.127" offset="2936477">And the British Act of 1765 was the Act that governed the British troops at the time of the American Revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.846" offset="2975347">That those articles specifically provided that in the event of murder, or capital offense committed by any of the troops, it was the duty of the commanding officer to turn that soldier over the civil magistrate to be tried according to the civil law.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.762" offset="3063014">That's Section 11, Article I of the British Articles of 1765.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.232" offset="3104914">And if Your Honors will recall for a moment in the Boston Massacre of 1770, which the British troops fired on the citizens living in Boston and killed I believe some five citizens and the great human cry they raised at that time to have those British soldiers summarily punished and court-martialed.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.199" offset="3204702">John Adams came to the defense of the British soldiers and by legitimate means, it was held that those men should be tried in the civil courts of Massachusetts and sometime after the massacre occurred, they were tried in the civil courts of Massachusetts, and the captain in charge of the troops was acquitted by the civil court, a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.215" offset="3304803">And I believe that the highest penalty meted out by that court was the penalty of manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.527" offset="3334060">After the British Articles of War, the Continental Congress in Massachusetts passed the Massachusetts Articles of War in 1775.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.620" offset="3370423">It's pretty much the same and identical to the British Articles of War, except that the soldiers had the right who were serving in the Massachusetts colony at that time not to subscribe to those Articles of War if they didn't see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.438" offset="3429669">The Continental Congress in June 30 of 1775 passed the American Articles of War and they were based on the British Articles of 1765.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.855" offset="3483376">On September 20th, 1766, the American Articles of War were revised by the Continental Congress and those articles specifically provided that the soldier who committed murder or a capital offense would be turned over to a civilian magistrate for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.267" offset="3573029">Now, the same Congress which enacted -- Continental Congress, which enacted the American Articles of War of 1776, also brought into being Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution Clause 14, that the Congress shall make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.016" offset="3683997">That phrase as it is contained in the Constitution is lifted from the Articles of Confederation, word per word, the power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.831" offset="3723285">And we have the Congress that first started -- the Confederate Congress, not the Constitutional Congress but the Congress that was in existence in 1776 that provided or instituted this provision of what Congress should do with respect to the military, specifically providing in the first articles which it adopted that a man who was accused of murder or a capital offense should be turned over to the civil magistrate for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.528" offset="3866018">We also know that in England, about that time, the case of Grant versus Gould, it was decided and in that case the issue under then the British Mutiny Acts and their Articles of War was whether -- the issue that was presented to the Court was whether or not the accused was a civilian because if he was a civilian, he could not be court-martialed irrespective of whether he had served in the Army before.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.598" offset="3982315">Grant versus Gould is reported at 2 Henry Blackstone, page 69, 126 English Reports at 434.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.774" offset="4027037">I would also like to make it clear that brings us up to the time the Constitution was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.384" offset="4053473">Now, since the time the Constitution has been adopted, there was never any provision in any Articles of War that a civilian could be tried by the military and looking at the articles that were for the Government and regulation of the navy and the articles that were adopted for the Government and regulation of the army, there was never any provision in any code or any statute that discharge from the service was a bar to subsequent prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.762" offset="4183040">There was the usual statute of limitations contained in the articles of two years or something of that sort, five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.733" offset="4210834">No statute in the event of murder but there was never any provision in the articles that discharge from the service was a bar, that honorable discharge from the service was a bar, or that dismissal from the service was a bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.243" offset="4280947">Yet up until the time -- up until the present time, in fact, it has been the universal holdings of the courts that discharge of the -- from the service is a complete bar to military prosecution for any offense committed in the service prior to the time of discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.504" offset="4366002">Up until March 2, 1863, no statute had ever been passed or no allusions were ever made either in this Court or any other court that the military would have jurisdiction over civilians.Then during Civil War days, the 37th Congress at the 3rd Session, the Act of March 2, 1863 was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.121" offset="4476447">The first section of that statute specifically states that there were -- this was for the emergency that was existing in time of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.812" offset="4523154">It was a war time measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.688" offset="4534648">The Senator who introduced the Bill on the floor of the Senate -- my recollection is that it was Senator Howard, realized that this field which was in many sections, the first section dealing with embezzlements by troops and officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.027" offset="4600059">Second section providing that irrespective of discharge, that they were still subject to trial by court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.272" offset="4629002">The third section I believe called for the court-martial by the military of any civilian contractor who embezzled from the United States and then there was another section providing for informer privileges and penalties that would accrue to a person committing fraud against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.133" offset="4716460">The Senator who introduced the legislation in the Senate, Senator Howard in introducing the Bill, stated that there was a question concerning whether the military could court-martial a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.000" offset="4775915">But that was not a problem for the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.312" offset="4789185">That was a problem for the judiciary, the courts to decide.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Kehoe, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1257.212" offset="5028780">No?</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.411" offset="5029616">In the brief?</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.970" offset="5031811">That's at page 32, the footnote on page 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.902" offset="5079562">Now, Senator Howard who was the manager of the Bill, in arguing the Bill before the Senate, they have to the Bill stated that the military could court-martial any contractor who did business with the Army and any contractor who did business with the Army could -- could be considered a member of the Armed Forces just as though he was serving in the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.979" offset="5191889">Now, this Act of March 2, 1863 is apparently the strongest stone upon which the Government relies in their presentation, saying apparently that this Court should not strike down at this late date, legislation which has been in existence for some 90 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.919" offset="5287602">And they referred to the case of In re Bogart in the Circuit Court in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.298" offset="5313097">I think the case was decided about 1872, which stands for the proposition that this Act of Congress was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.498" offset="5353953">In re Bogart is discussed at some length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.660" offset="5374537">It stands for the proposition that the Act of March 2, 1863 was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.950" offset="5399719">It also stands for the proposition that the military can court-martial a civilian at any time, irrespective of whether or not there was an Act of Congress of March 2, 1863 in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.465" offset="5453845">And the Government would apparently want to adopt the Bogart decision or have this Court adopt the Bogart decision which refers to the Fifth Amendment on the fact that cases in the Fifth Amendment as the word is used in the exception in the Fifth Amendment means nothing more than events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.709" offset="5530749">But going back to this 37th Congress, which adopted the legislation, that's the Act of March 2, 1863, they also as a part of that same legislation, the same Act, the same statute has a different section, leave it with Section 3 enacted the provision that civilians who did business with the Army and who performed any embezzlement or embezzled any money from the United States would be court-martialed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.827" offset="5655301">That provision was struck down in the case of Ex parte Henderson approximately 1868 and from that day to this, it has never been arisen -- it's heard again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.916" offset="5707651">Now, on March 3, 1863, another statute was approved which had been passed in that same Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.243" offset="5744953">It could be called Civil War Draft Act, we will -- that was its main tenor and purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.918" offset="5771598">But that was the Act -- one of the sections of that Act which also set up the very infamous military commissions which existed during the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.300" offset="5817156">This Court had occasioned to consider the Act of March 3, 1863 through the day after one that we have in issue here or pass it over that's in issue here and in Ex parte Milligan struck down that statute and up until the present time we had thought, this Court had made it very clear in Ex parte Milligan that the right of a civilian citizen of this country guaranteed him in the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment could not be deprived by any Act of Congress setting up a military commission or military government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.859" offset="6007432">The third point that we have before the Court is the consideration of the Uniform Code of Military Justice itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.138" offset="6056542">We previously stated to the Court and stated in our brief and was -- as was ruled by the District Court, there is a casus omissus in the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.597" offset="6110354">Article 3 (a), which apparently is the section of the code, the Government says is in jurisdiction provides that irrespective of discharge or change of status that a soldier shall not be relieved from amenability to trial by courts-martial by reason of the termination of said status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.886" offset="6223517">It is our position that there is nothing in Article 3 (a) which permits the military to arrest, apprehend, or confine a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.791" offset="6275135">When Congress said that the military -- that this amenability would still -- still exist, it didn't say that the military would have jurisdiction to try a civilian or the honorably discharged soldier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.156" offset="6340545">It merely used the loose words -- loose word “amenability.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.212" offset="6372833">There's nothing in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.551" offset="6378162">There's no article of -- Article 3 (a) which says anything about jurisdiction over a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.073" offset="6408255">The Court Of Appeals in its opinion states that what Congress intended by that was that discharge would not be an absolution for crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.420" offset="6457678">We can agree with what the Court of Appeals said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.206" offset="6472725">Article 3 (a) may be an intention of Congress, or a thought of Congress, or a resolution of Congress that discharge will not be an absolution for crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.250" offset="6528940">But the recognition that discharge is not absolution for crime does not confer jurisdiction on the -- over the discharged person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.769" offset="6566975">Irrespective of the Constitution itself, the statute in issue does not confer jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.414" offset="6609607">The Air Force, if I may characterize their argument and their position throughout this case, apparently has -- playing the old shell game with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.228" offset="6660911">They put three shells up, Article 3 (a), Article 7, and Article 9, and say -- says to the Court then to the court below and to the District Court, that jurisdiction over this civilian is in these shells.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.150" offset="6748578">You pick up the shell of Article 3 (a), not a reference to jurisdiction.It can't be interpreted to confer a jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.165" offset="6792568">It was no intention in the language to confer jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.274" offset="6813048">You pick up the shell of Article 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.217" offset="6832797">Article 7 calls for the apprehension of various people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.952" offset="6859755">They say apprehension as defined in Article 7 (a), as apprehension is the taking into custody of a person at simple arrest, the arrest that we know in civilian life that every police officer arresting without a warrant has the right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.831" offset="6935301">Article 7 (b), any person authorized under regulations governing the Armed Forces to apprehend persons subject to this code or to trial thereunder may do so upon reasonable belief that an offense has been committed and that the person apprehended committed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.416" offset="7009593">First, we say under Article 7 (b) that Toth a civilian is not one of those persons who are subject to this code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.941" offset="7051703">Article 2 of the Code at least very definitely and completely some 12 categories of persons who are subject to the code and an honorably discharged serviceman is not listed in those categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.554" offset="7114188">Secondly, Article 7 (b), if it could be stretched to include the arrest -- arrest or apprehension of a civilian merely means exactly what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.369" offset="7161417">All they can do is take him into custody and then what can they do with him?</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.377" offset="7189420">The regulations were -- which were issued under Article 7 state that they must then turn him over to his commanding officer, the arrested person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.020" offset="7232052">That they cannot do with Toth and in any event, Article 7 has nothing to do with jurisdiction for court-martial by jurisdiction to try by court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.925" offset="7275624">If you pick up the shell of Article 7, you see that there is no jurisdiction to try a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.371" offset="7309479">If we look to Article 9, Article 9 defines arrest and confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.728" offset="7342811">States Article 9 (a), confinement is the physical restraint of a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.431" offset="7365695">And that is what has been done with Toth up until the time in September 3 that his discharge was ordered by the District Judge, he was held in confinement by the Air Force.</text>

            <text syncTime="1880.541" offset="7522116">It may have been Congress' intention, the intention of Congress to confer jurisdiction over a discharged serviceman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.156" offset="7568614">But with all due respect to the Congress, they didn't do so and that is our position with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.015" offset="7608007">If you examine the three articles in question, which are the only articles that the Air Force can rely on, look at each one of them, you'll see that there is no jurisdiction to court-martial this civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.985" offset="7671850">And the -- in its brief, the Government practically concedes that as reference to commanding officer in Article 9 that Toth cannot have a commanding officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.254" offset="7712914">He is a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.863" offset="7719393">He has no commanding officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.130" offset="7728483">They say, “Where will we find the commanding officer?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1938.574" offset="7754292">But they did not cite a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.916" offset="7767562">And we respectfully submit to the Court there are no the regulations which would permit the confinement or trial of Toth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.932" offset="7807687">We also respectfully submit to the Court that under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the President has no authority to promulgate any such regulation or regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.801" offset="7859200">The authority is not given to the President and it is the Congress who has the authority to make rules for the Government and regulation of the land and naval forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.574" offset="7922207">We respectfully submit to the Court that under -- when this Act of Congress is broadly looked at, the Court will see that Congress is devoid of authority under Section 1 of the Constitution to enact any legislation that would look to court-martial of a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.779" offset="8027115">When we look to the Fifth and Sixth Amendment, we'd see that there is a complete bar to the court-martial and deprivation of the right of a civilian.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Kehoe, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2175.650" offset="8702537">When we look again at the Uniform Code as the Board of Act of Congress, if we can call it that, this business of concurring jurisdiction to try and honorably discharged serviceman and the deprivation of the rights guaranteed in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, I believe the best example that we have of that is the fact that there is no -- absolutely no provision in the code for admission to bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.427" offset="8833672">If we examine this case, unless the District Court at the time the Government indicated its intention to appeal, had put Toth on a bail bond, an appeal bond he would still be held in confinement for some two years by the Air Force, no means of livelihood, no means of supporting his family, no means of hiring attorneys or counsel, no means even of buying cigarettes, has no money at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.554" offset="8982152">Now, the -- as my understanding, I don't have a citation to the case that the Court of Military Appeals had before it a soldier, man in service who is requesting the right of bail, no provision in the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.343" offset="9069296">And the Court of Appeals said there's no necessity for any such provision in the Uniform Code of Military Justice because the soldier doesn't need bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.132" offset="9112451">He is receiving his pay when he is in confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.799" offset="9127184">His family, if he's -- if he's supporting his family from his pay, is being taken care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.921" offset="9151634">He is being fed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.561" offset="9158217">He is being clothed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.706" offset="9166785">His insurance and all his other benefits that he gets as a serviceman keep accruing to him when he's in confinement awaiting trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.158" offset="9196565">He is much different than a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.140" offset="9208477">Not only that, but he doesn't need money for attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.637" offset="9222478">Attorneys are appointed by the service involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.897" offset="9235540">So all the benefits that a civilian would get by being allowed to go free on bail, the soldier is not deprived of that, other than his freedom and that is apparently was not important to the Court of Military Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.917" offset="9303667">Now, we respectfully submit that the -- that one little example, the fact that Congress would not have a section in here permitting an honorably discharged civilian to go free on bail pending the time of trial shows that this legislation was not well fought out and that Article 3 (a) does not serve the purpose which the Government says that it does.</text>

            <text syncTime="2403.214" offset="9612852">If this were the case of military service attempting to exert jurisdiction over a civilian, who at no time had any connection with the military, at no pertinent time, I would agree with its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.313" offset="9677218">This is not such a case, this is a case of a man who while in the military service is a -- it is said he's discharged, committed a murder and the question is entirely different from what he states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.144" offset="9740539">It's a question whether having been in the military service at the time of the alleged offense and not being subject to any accountability in any civil court, federal or state, whether under such circumstances Congress could validly, as it attempted, grant military jurisdiction to trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.027" offset="13872065">All these other things are accorded in by the code and if there -- jury trial and the -- the grand jury indictment or the jury trial are not to provided for, the answer is that the Fifth Amendment specifically accepts cases arising in the armed service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3899.412" offset="15597610">Even though the civil law -- this Court has held that there is no requirement of any preliminary hearing before removal, except where a statute provides it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5961.570" offset="23846243">I believe I may shed some light on this Article 9 (c), that the authority to order persons into arrest or confinement may not be delegated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5972.677" offset="23890651">The regulations which were issued under the code of President Truman, Regulation 21 (a) defines commanding officer as a reference to that regulation and the definition of commanding officer in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5987.811" offset="23951151">The Secretary of the service involved is not a commanding officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.760" offset="23974975">He is not defined as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.793" offset="23987096">The -- when the -- this Article 9 (c) refers to officers, warrant officers and civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.384" offset="24017502">And it has to be the superior officer, of the officer involved, who orders him into arrest which means that it's a moral persuasion that he stays in his quarters or orders him confined.</text>
            <text syncTime="6018.384" offset="24073509">A captain, for example, who was ordering a lieutenant into arrest cannot delegate that chore to a subordinate officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6028.938" offset="24115722">It has to be a superior officer to the officer being arrested or confined who performs that task.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.086" offset="24152294">Now, of course when he's going to confine another officer, he can order that -- enlisted personnel will actually escort him to the jail or the penitentiary, wherever they're taking him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.520" offset="24210077">And I believe if that that's what that means and it's most peculiarly applicable to Toth because he had no commanding officer who could delegate any power to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6065.856" offset="24263367">Now, going back to the original argument of the Solicitor General, I would gather from his argument that he said the commander of the Fifth Air Force in Korea would be Toth's commanding officer at the time this arrest was ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="6084.512" offset="24337972">Toth was in Pittsburg, the -- Fifth Air Force commander had no authority outside of the Korea or Korean area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.762" offset="24383007">Now, the Acting Secretary of the Air Force consented to his arrest or his apprehension and ordered the air provost marshal to affect his apprehension, or as he put it to offset his apprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.224" offset="24452807">And it stands to reason that the air provost marshal had no connection as a commanding officer to Toth and under the regulations issued pursuant to the code, the Secretary of the Air Force could not be considered a commanding officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.551" offset="24534204">The Solicitor General has alluded to the fact that Toth had all the fair hearings and preliminary inquiries that were necessary and that he would have received as a civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.578" offset="24578299">The record in the case indicate that the time these accusations were filed against Toth, four men, three in the service and Toth out of the service were accused of conspiracy to commit murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="6161.556" offset="24646217">After Toth was escorted from Pittsburg to Korea, one of these men, Sergeant Kenneth Bogard was exculpated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6173.112" offset="24692402">He never stood court-martial charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="6175.125" offset="24700447">It was determined upon investigation that he was not guilty, that was after the fact of Toth being transported from Pittsburg to Korea that the investigation started to determine whether there was reasonable grounds to hold him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.416" offset="24773590">There was no determination prior to his transportation to Korea or whether or not there was reasonable grounds to hold him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6202.377" offset="24809430">Now, to -- there's a reference made to what happened to the other two men, Lieutenant Schreiber, who is supposed to have ordered this killing and Airman Kinder, who was suppose to pull the trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="6217.243" offset="24868885">As we advised the Court before, those cases went up through the uniform -- under the code, went up to the Court of Military Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6226.743" offset="24906919">At the time of the last argument we advised the Court that Lieutenant Kinder received the two-year sentence, he was the triggerman and that he is sentenced and subsequently then commuted and he was discharged from the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.837" offset="24963344">Schreiber's conviction was upheld by the Military Court of Appeals, this is in their records in their cases some time last May, within a week after his sentence, according to my information was confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6254.601" offset="25018305">The Secretary of the Air Force commuted his sentence and gave him a dishonorable discharge, and permitted him to leave the service, and I think he left the service on May 18, 1955 having served approximately 18 to 20 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="6270.001" offset="25079954">This is not a heinous crime that this man has been charged with.</text>
            <text syncTime="6274.674" offset="25098658">I think that the treatment by the Air Force revealed that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6281.555" offset="25126139">Now, the Solicitor General would also infer that there is due process and all the constitutional guarantees were much of them as a necessary are engendered within this Uniform Code of Military Justice, and suggest to the Court that they examine the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.190" offset="25192699">I suggest to the Court that the code be examined too because you will see upon examination of the code that the entire purpose is summary punishment, discipline in the rank, it has nothing to do with justice, justice is not meant to be dispensed there.</text>
