            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">If it please the Court, the second -- the contention of the United States here as I understand it is that the finding that this man will probably endanger the safety of the officers and property or other interests of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.060" offset="96235">And the finding, the suitable arrangements are not available elsewhere for him supports the right of the United States to imprison him or whatever is said about his care or treatment, he is being imprisoned and he is imprisoned side by side with prisoners and as just as much of a prisoner as if he was convicted and had been convicted of -- of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.248" offset="208980">And I think that it is important that we consider him as an innocent man as we must consider it.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.627" offset="398420">Think -- think of the dangerousness of such a statute in spite of the good motives of the United States or the authorities, I think, we have here a statute that by its terminology is an extremely dangerous statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.153" offset="724532">To me, it's -- it's quite vague to say that someone will probably endanger, you don't have to find that he will endanger the officers of the United States or you don't have to find that he will endanger the -- the property, but even on a finding of some other interests without those other interest being defined, we can -- we can keep a man in prison and that's the point that I was trying to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="805.573" offset="3222256">Now, I covert briefly in conclusion because of these two conditions that the Government contends give to the United States the power to restrain this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.996" offset="3267918">I would like to refer briefly to my final point that there was not substantial evidence to show that he was potentially dangerous to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.961" offset="3307833">The reason for referring to the evidence is that if this is the kind of evidence that allows, that comes within this statute, that it allows the United States to continue to imprison this man, then it is our position clearly that -- that this is not a proper and constitutional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.167" offset="3392575">And referring to the record on page 68 and the report of the neuropsychiatric staff when the question of the conditions under 4247 came up as to whether they existed, the Board said that they agreed that the subject might be considered potentially dangerous to the extent that if released he might conceivably, might conceivably persist in criminal activities of the type of which he is presently charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.957" offset="3515768">In considering this man's mental illness, the Board find that he does not hold any fixed delusion concerning wanting to harm any person or group of persons either officials of the government or otherwise, so that in this respect, he probably would not constitute a danger to the safety of the officers, property or other interests of the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. William J. Burrell</label>
            <text syncTime="1102.934" offset="4411664">That is right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.921" offset="4415634">I gave you the pages in the original transcript, its on page 24 and 30 of the -- of our record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.885" offset="4455445">And again referring to the evidence there that was before the Court of the hearing on July 30th and the testimony of Dr. Smith who was Chief of the Psychiatric Staff there at the Medical Center, their question is set out on page 29 of our brief, “What you do not find that he had any fixed delusions concerning wanting to harm any person or group of persons, officials of the government or otherwise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.226" offset="4560875">Answer - “No, Counselor, we did not and we pointed that out because -- and we found evidence of such delusions, if he had held fixed ideas that the government people wanted to hurt him or if he held ideas that he wanted to hurt the Government, either one might have been construed is making him potentially dangerous.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.976" offset="4631824">And further testimony, “If he held the ideas that he wanted to harm the Government or its instrumentalities or perhaps even if we had been able to develop ideas that the Government wanted to harm him, we might have felt that there was an indication of potential dangerousness but we found neither.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.394" offset="4697548">And then Dr. Smith further testified, “One of the factors which complicates this whole thing as it is,” this is on page 31 of the brief of petitioner, “that as you probably know the hospitals, everyday are releasing man of this type, that is they are turning them out on the streets presumably at least with responsible relatives, that sort of things, so that they are certainly many schizophrenics on the streets whose illness is of the same severity as the defendant here perhaps.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.072" offset="4820219">So that there is a great pressure on their part apparently to turn those men loose to make room for men that they conceive as worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.196" offset="4856686">And as Judge Whittaker said in -- in a case there, the -- in -- in the United States District Court, it isn't a question of where the -- whether the facilities are perhaps better in the federal prison or whether the facilities are better as furnished by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.317" offset="4933172">It's -- it's a question of a power to restrain this man's liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.100" offset="4952398">And we respectfully submit that's on the record and the facts that he should be released to the authorities in the state of his residence for further care or custody as -- as the State sees that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1259.196" offset="5036722">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.054" offset="5048216">Mr. Burrell has so fully and so fairly outlined the provisions of these statutes that I'll not take much time on them, unless there are some questions the Court wants to ask about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.247" offset="5108924">I think its -- it made perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.350" offset="5121358">But I like to say some general things about the statute and then go to the main point in this case, the only real point that's before the Court, the constitutional question that he is raising, because I don't think that the fact problem that he raises is -- is one that will appeal to the Court as requiring any reversal, the two courts having made their finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.580" offset="5226266">Now, I don't suppose that any statute has ever been brought before this Court for adjudication that has a more distinguished paternity than this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.742" offset="5278929">As Your Honors know, it's the product of very careful study that lasted from 1942 to 1949 by distinguished Committee of federal judges appointed by the Judicial Conference of the United States because of the recognition of the existing problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.151" offset="5372552">The Chairman of that Committee was Judge Magruder of First Circuit, members of that Committee were Judge Hincks in Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.392" offset="5409541">He was a district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.423" offset="5417691">Judge Learned Hand was a member of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.380" offset="5429499">The file show that these distinguished men didn't accept something that was done for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.678" offset="5462622">This is not a ghostwritten statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.948" offset="5471713">It was done by the best legal and judicial brains in the nation and done deliberately and whatever might be speculated about whether a cabinet officer had somebody presenting something, then he signs without really concentrating on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.834" offset="5543288">Certainly, these men who corresponded at length and thought deeply about this thing acted with deliberation and then they worked also in cooperation with the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Prisons, Mr. Bennett, and the doctors and the administrators of the Prison Bureau and of the Mental Hospitals of the United States, Dr. Overholser, and other doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.197" offset="5672751">That was a hearing which is recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.754" offset="5686962">You have a testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.027" offset="5692082">You gather from that that this has been very well considered and not only in its administrative aspects but also the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.444" offset="5737744">Now, prior to 1942 and the reason for the appointment of the Committee, the different judges, district judges were finding that many men were coming before them who really ought not to be brought before them because of their mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.440" offset="5809737">The prison authorities were receiving men convicted who really ought never had been put on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.322" offset="5845264">And these officials were driven to going through these irregular, unjust, illegal gestures because there was no particular -- there was no alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.998" offset="5907958">At least it was deemed necessary to establish an orderly procedure that would set out those cases that were obviously unfit for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.197" offset="5960725">One section of this law provides a procedure to deal with that and other section is to pick up any mistakes so that if the question was not raised perhaps because the man did not have proper counsel or any counsel and it's found shortly after his admission to the prison that he's really insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.876" offset="6051422">There is an orderly procedure for raising the question in determining whether he had really had due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.299" offset="6073156">And then the question arose what ought to be the order of commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.305" offset="6101159">As originally drawn, the statute simply said that in that case if a man is found after hearing to be insane, he should be committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.198" offset="6216725">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.830" offset="6227278">Section 4246, whenever the trial court shall determine in accordance with Sections 4244 and 4245 of this title that an accused is or was mentally incompetent, the Court may commit the accused to the custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.432" offset="6309721">That's where the original draft stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.901" offset="6327589">And then you can see it as -- in a moving picture, the development of this thing and the correspondence of the members of the Committee, until the -- the question was raised, well, what do you do in the case of a man who may not be tried shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.358" offset="6413375">How are you going to raise the commitment then?</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.669" offset="6430616">So it was proposed, then this language was added.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.483" offset="6449842">It shall be -- he's authorized to be committed to the Attorney General until, at the last three lines of that page, until the accused shall be mentally competent to stand trial or until the pending charges against him are disposed of according to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.130" offset="6520477">They felt to make it constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.884" offset="6527478">They have to put that limitation on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.396" offset="6541584">Then our attention was further directed to the problem of what do you do with cases where a man may not be tried for a very long time, where it's indefinite -- indefinite duration of the arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.747" offset="6606890">Do you treat him the same way?</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.294" offset="6617130">Here is a practical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.586" offset="6622250">You can't just dump the man on the street to commit further depredations, yet, there ought to be some greater safeguard in a case like that because he's being committed for an indefinite time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.357" offset="6673345">So they added this language, the second -- the second sentence of this Section 4246, which appears on the top of page 62, and this is the new language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.257" offset="6728934">And if the Court after hearing as provided in the preceding Sections 4244 and 4245 shall determine that the conditions specified in the following Section 4247 exists, the commitment shall be governed by 4248.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.082" offset="6800300">Now, what are the conditions in 4247?</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.975" offset="6811899">The conditions in 4247, you see on page 63, that is whenever a person, I'm looking at Section 4248, the -- I'll read from the beginning, whenever a person shall be committed pursuant to Section -- let me first read 4247 on page 62, “Whenever the Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall certify that a prisoner whose sentence is about to expire.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.079" offset="6928300">Now, you notice originally they were thinking only of the man who has served his time and they recognized that he's a menace if left at large and they wanted to know what to do about him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.144" offset="6968529">But by the addition of the five or six lines in the preceding section, they made these conditions, which are outlined in 4247, apply also to the man who was not yet been tried because of his mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.490" offset="7025894">And what are the conditions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.572" offset="7038224">If it is found by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons that this man who -- whose sentence is about to expire or the man who has been committed and he can't yet be tried under the other section, that he is insane or mentally incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.503" offset="7105933">Two, that if released, he will probably endanger the safety of the officers, the property or other interests of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.335" offset="7137280">And three, that suitable arrangements for the custody and care of the prisoner are not otherwise available, then the Attorney General shall transmit the certificate to the Court and the Court shall cause the prisoner to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.088" offset="7204258">And then the reports of the psychiatrists are filed to the Court and then there's a hearing and not -- and there must be due notice and he must have the benefit of counsel and the report of the psychiatrist is made available and any other testimony is made available on behalf of the man or on behalf of the Government that will bear on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.607" offset="7278341">Then, if he is found to be insane and if these other two conditions are present, they believe that he is a probable danger to some interests of the United States or its property or its officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.269" offset="7329019">And other suitable arrangements are unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.852" offset="7347304">If those three conditions are present, then he is committed under 4248 which appears on page 63 and you'll see that the duration of the commitment is hedged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.684" offset="7394638">First, you can -- you keep him until the -- whichever event shall first occur of these three that until his mental condition is so improved that if released he will not endanger the safety of officers, property or other interests of the United States or until suitable arrangements had been made for the custody and care of the prisoner, either his sanity has restored or he's sufficiently improved does -- no longer to be in danger or you have an alternative, a State is willing to take him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.242" offset="7524937">Now, that was done and in the judgment of these members of the Committee that met all constitutional requirements even in the case of the man who is indefinitely ill and has to be detained indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.196" offset="7596722">Of course, he always has the right to test out the question as to whether he's sufficiently improved to be discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.172" offset="7624620">He -- he could raise that on habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.248" offset="7632980">The statute recognizes that even if the statute didn't, of course, habeas corpus would be available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.176" offset="7660669">Not only was this draft passed on by the members of the Committee but it was circulated at the instance of the conference, the Judicial Conference of the United States among all the circuit and district judges of a country, 20 to 30 of them wrote in and making this -- that suggestion, all these things were carefully and deliberately considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.373" offset="7745411">And the final draft is what wasn't enacted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.383" offset="7765473">Now, I'd like to come to the -- first, the -- the question as to whether the statute means what we say it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.508" offset="7822002">The judges in the Tenth Circuit and in the Ninth Circuit having before them cases unlike this and that those people were not found to be dangerous, there was no -- there was no attempt to make such a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.145" offset="7884487">They have the ordinary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.864" offset="7895353">There has been no definite finding of dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.572" offset="7906220">There has been no enquiry into the availability of alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.622" offset="7922416">So it is -- and the only section of -- the only portion of 4246 that was complied with was the first sentence that didn't have these safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.740" offset="7982916">It was on that kind of a case that the Ninth and the Tenth Circuit said, “We do not read the statute as covering the case of one in -- an indefinite duration of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.229" offset="8056895">To do so -- to read it so would be -- would raise great constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.407" offset="8081554">In one case, the judge said, “I think the man ought to be discharged because the statute so read would be unconstitutional.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.796" offset="8111125">In other words, in the case of a person who was not found dangerous and not -- and there was no showing that there was no alternative facilities, they said, it was not enough for the Government to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.047" offset="8172147">You have here the first reported case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.340" offset="8185313">There have been six commitments under the statute, but you have the first reported case here, where there was an attempt and, I think with -- on -- on sufficient basis to declare whether or not there -- this man was dangerous and whether or not there was alternative facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.301" offset="8261172">He was found on the testimony of the doctors to be a danger and he was -- it was also found as it's amply proven in the -- by experience in this case that Ohio wouldn't take him and there was no other place for him to go.</text>
