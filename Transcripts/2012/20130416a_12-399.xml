            <text syncTime="1466.298" offset="5972162">But the second thing I would put on the table is I think the fact that 1916(a) tells you that the one time you are thinking about transferring custody, Congress looked to the best interest standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.339" offset="6016361">That's a good hint that if you are talking about transferring custody you should look to the best interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.827" offset="6038304">And, again, I think it's imperative to look at 1912(d), (e), and (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.212" offset="6055858">As the Government and the Solicitor General recognizes, they all contemplate continued custody, (e) and (f) do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.534" offset="6081145">Now, then the Government turns around and says: Well, but (d) was a basis for what the lower court did, which is to transfer custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.454" offset="6108834">With all due respect to the Government, (d) makes even less sense as a basis for transferring custody than (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.858" offset="6134434">At least (f) has some standard designed for some transfer of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.496" offset="6152929">It happens to be the wrong transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.396" offset="6160557">It's the transfer away from continuing custody out and it's beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.983" offset="6178947">But (d) has no standard to satisfy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.268" offset="6188038">And their position is that because this birth father was not presented with remedial and rehabilitative services, therefore, because he didn't get remedial services that presumably he needed, he gets the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.509" offset="6241014">That's crazy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.944" offset="6246761">And what it shows is that 12(d) assumes that it's like an exhaustion requirement, and unless and until these services are provided you preserve the status quo ante.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.500" offset="6288975">But the lower court didn't preserve the status quo ante.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.452" offset="6300782">The lower court ordered this poor girl sent to somebody who, at least under state law and just a matter of practicality, is a stranger to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.208" offset="6335786">And nowhere in the law do you see any child being transferred to a new custodial arrangement without a best interest determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.647" offset="6369536">And why did it happen here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.263" offset="6376015">It happened here because of ICWA, which by its terms does not apply to these situations, and it happened because of 3/256ths of Cherokee blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.053" offset="6415198">Now, the Justice Department back in 1978 recognized there were profound constitutional problems with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.290" offset="6440172">Then-Assistant Assistant Attorney General, later Judge, Patricia Wald, told Congress that there were applications of the statute that raised equal protection problems because they treated people differently solely on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.932" offset="6494715">One of the things she pointed to is what she point -- described as</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.634" offset="6509553">"the (b) portion of the definition of “ Indian child ”. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.352" offset="6520420">And that's what makes this child an Indian child here, its biology, its biology combined with the fact that the tribe, based on a racial classification, thinks that somebody with 325 -- 1 percent Indian blood is enough to make them a tribal -- a tribal member, eligible for tribal membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.015" offset="6603071">And as a result of that, her whole world changes and this whole inquiry changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.384" offset="6620521">It goes from an inquiry focused on her best interests and it changes to a focus on the birth father and whether or not beyond a reasonable doubt there is a clear and present danger.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.178" offset="10331685">Just to nail this down, as to the particular membership criteria of the Cherokee Nation, no one has ever suggested, our opponents here do not suggest that that is, in any sense, illegitimate or not a traditional basis for establishing membership in an Indian tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.021" offset="10395110">So if one can imagine wild hypotheticals of the sort that Justice Alito and the Chief Justice have suggested, they are not present here, and those would present political questions to be addressed by Congress or addressed by the executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.412" offset="10440668">In this case, again, the Sate courts found that ICWA should be applied to allow a natural father to raise his child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.453" offset="10480792">Those courts found that s in the best interests of the child to be raised by their natural parent because that parent was a fit, was a loving, was a devoted parent in the words of -- of the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.511" offset="10529066">Those conclusions were quite clearly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.296" offset="10540142">And if I can turn to something which attracted some attention from Justice Scalia and Justice Sotomayor in their exchanges with Ms. Blatt, the application of Section 1912(d) and whether or not the parental rights of this -- this father, who unquestionably satisfies the definition of parent in ICWA, Section 1912(d) says that parental rights cannot be terminated unless remedial efforts have been made, rehabilitative efforts have been made to fix a family that is broken in some respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.315" offset="10660305">And Ms. Blatt suggests that that does not apply here because there was no Indian family.</text>
