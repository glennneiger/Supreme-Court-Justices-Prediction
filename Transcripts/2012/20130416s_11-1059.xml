            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Thomas has our opinion this morning in case 11-1059, Genesis HealthCare versus Symczyk.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="9.955" stopTime="294.672">
            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="9.955" offset="145283">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and I don't have good news for them either.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.115" offset="197841">The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, FLSA, provides that an employee may bring an action to recover damages for specified violations on behalf of himself and other similarly situated employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.108" offset="265864">In this case, the respondent who worked as a nurse filed a suit against her former employers alleging that they violated the FLSA by automatically deducting 30 minutes per shift for meals -- for meal breaks even when employees worked during those periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.477" offset="347366">Respondent claim she was bringing suit for herself and on behalf of all other persons similarly situated, but she remained the only plaintiff throughout the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.699" offset="404208">After respondent filed her suit, petitioners offered her complete monitory relief on her individual claim as well as caused in attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.607" offset="447885">Respondent rejected the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.221" offset="458334">The District Court then dismissed the suit concluding that petitioner's offer rendered the suit moot because it would have given the respondent everything she requested as an individual plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.328" offset="514759">The Third Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.735" offset="524372">The Court concluded that even though petitioner's offer satisfied respondent's individual claim, the action was not moot because respondent also filed a complaint on behalf of similarly situated employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.910" offset="589051">The Court believed that this fact entitled respondent to continue the collective action suit in District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.601" offset="623846">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.948" offset="645162">The constitution provides that federal courts only have jurisdiction over "Cases and Controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.569" offset="675673">This language requires plaintiff to show that they had a personal -- plaintiffs to show that they have a personal stake in the outcome of the litigation at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.287" offset="726559">Otherwise, a suit becomes moot and must be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.878" offset="744950">In this case, respondent did dispute -- the District Court's didn't -- did not dispute the District Court's conclusion that the petitioner's offer fully satisfied her individual claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.495" offset="795418">In light of this concession, a straightforward application of mootness principles confirms that the action was appropriately dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.140" offset="842021">Respondent offers a number of reasons why she believes she still has a personal stake in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.703" offset="872218">We do not find any of them persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.158" offset="890086">First, the respondent argues that she has a statutory interest in representing other employees under the FLSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.021" offset="921537">However, nothing in the FLSA gives a right when the named plaintiff is the only plaintiff in the suit and her individual claim is fully satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.116" offset="965841">Second, respondent relies on several Rule 23 class-action cases suggesting that a name plaintiff may remain in a suit even after his claim is moot, if the claim is, inherently transitory.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.637" offset="1031983">These cases are irrelevant, however, because damages claims are not inherently transitory.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.472" offset="1055284">Damages claims remain viable until they are settled, judicially resolved or barred by statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.235" offset="1090393">Third, respondent argues that the purposes of the FLSAs collective action provisions could be frustrated by strategic settlement offers designed to pick off named plaintiffs before a collective action can run its course.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.638" offset="1156012">But this policy concern cannot overcome the constitutional requirement that the named plaintiff maintain a personal stake throughout the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.058" offset="1193629">Because respondent cannot show that she maintained a personal stake in the suit and once her individual claim became moot, we conclude that the District Court was correct to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.752" offset="1252456">Justice Kagan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor joined.</text>
