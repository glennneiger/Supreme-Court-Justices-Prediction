            <text syncTime="11.622" offset="154417">A fairly presented claim has been adjudicated on the merits when a state court issues a decision denying relief unless it has made a plain statement to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.496" offset="193915">And this is especially true where the state court has grappled with the substance of the alleged error.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.567" offset="218261">And this rule is correct for three reasons:</text>
            <text syncTime="31.019" offset="232053">First, state courts discharge their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.821" offset="247204">They are sworn to uphold the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.541" offset="262146">Therefore, they must adjudicate claims that -- that allege constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.910" offset="283567">So when a state court issues a decision denying relief, it must necessarily have considered and rejected all of the claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="52.349" offset="317317">What happens when there is a challenge to the admission of evidence on a state law ground on a Confrontation Clause ground, and all the state court does is grapple with the evidentiary rule, but it's self evident that the Confrontation Clause is based on a different theory?</text>
            <text syncTime="72.310" offset="397252">Are we to assume, in the light of that kind of decision, that the court actually grappled with the Confrontation Clause?</text>

            <text syncTime="93.240" offset="480948">And that would be because -- for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.442" offset="489725">First, the presumption of regularity that judicial officers do do their job, and it can only be rebutted by clear evidence.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="104.198" offset="524729">Am I to make that assumption when, before our line of cases in this area, state courts generally had held that if hearsay was admissible under their evidentiary rules, that that was the end of their Confrontation Clause challenge?</text>
            <text syncTime="125.545" offset="610202">Is a Federal court supposed to continue with that presumption in light of an undisputed state's statement that their rules are consonant with the Confrontation Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.221" offset="780834">Well, we can continue and probably should talk about this broad theory that you want us to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.810" offset="811240">Really, in this case, the court of appeals in -- in the state system cited Nesler, and Nesler in turn cited, at page 104 of the petition appendix, a Supreme Court case you don't even -- you say citation, you don't even give -- but it -- it's -- it's the Supreme Court case, United States v. Wood, written by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.146" offset="924507">And it seems to me it very clearly ties its state analysis to the Federal Constitution and a Sixth Amendment discussion in Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.121" offset="972468">So it seems to me that you're -- you have a very strong argument that they did adjudicate the Federal claim anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.108" offset="1000367">I know you want us to maybe reach the bigger issue, but -- and your brief almost downplays it -- but it seems to me pretty clear that you have the argument, that you don't strongly make, although you don't, by any means, abandon it, that -- that here the state law was tied to the Federal standard, and the Federal standard was the basis for the entire jurisprudence.</text>

            <label>Ms. Stephanie Brenan</label>
            <text syncTime="244.704" offset="1086780">Yes, Your Honor, we agree that in our situation it just so happened to be that the state standard also encompassed this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence because it was citing U.S. v. Wood, and it was citing Smith v. Phillips among the -- the Sixth Amendment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.018" offset="1160027">In our case, it just so happens that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.702" offset="1170790">But we posit also that our case shows why this is illustrative as to why this Court should adopt the broader rule that, in situations where a state court has denied relief or a claim has been fairly presented, that this Court and all Federal courts should assume that the state courts did their job by adjudicating claims--</text>

            <text syncTime="321.019" offset="1392099">--Well, Your Honor, I posit that those Strickland cases are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.423" offset="1413624">And they are different because in all of those cases of Wiggins v. Smith and Rompilla, that there the courts -- what the State court did was follow exactly what this Court has said of how a Strickland claim may be answered entirely by only addressing the one prong of Strickland.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.201" offset="1484782">And so there they're doing exactly adjudicating everything through the analysis of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.355" offset="1509441">Additionally, in those cases, by doing so, the courts are not in any way suggesting that the State courts failed to do something.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="361.663" offset="1554581">Ms. Brenan, we are straying pretty far from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.567" offset="1574225">And correct me if I'm wrong, but, as I understand it, the argument was made under State law, and then Williams said there was an abuse of discretion under State law and therefore the Sixth Amendment was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.246" offset="1660951">So there really isn't any independent -- Williams hasn't stated any independent Sixth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.686" offset="1694702">It's State law was violated and therefore the Constitution was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.173" offset="1720615">So it seems to me if we just look at the position that Williams was taking, that these two, the State and the Federal claim, are tied -- tied together.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.515" offset="1778084">And we don't -- to go beyond this case and imagine some other case that might come before us some day would not be wise.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.535" offset="1894068">However, we suggest that this case does illustrate why that broader rule is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.790" offset="1927087">And it's important because, otherwise, other Federal courts may not view it as this Court did, seeing it as a dependent claim--</text>

            <text syncTime="480.942" offset="2031786">The brief filed with an intermediate State court of appeals contains 25 pages of argument on a Federal constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.814" offset="2071178">Let's say it's a Brady claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.048" offset="2076194">And then it also has two other claims, two other arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.534" offset="2090091">They are State law claims, and each one is dealt with in two pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.153" offset="2104615">And then the State court, intermediate court of appeals, issues an opinion that addresses only the two State law claims and says nothing about the Federal constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.794" offset="2151113">You would say there that -- that it's conclusively presumed that they adjudicated the Federal constitutional claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="521.667" offset="2194685">One, because of the presumption of regularity; two, because of what this Court has said in Richter, where we could view it as a summary denial; and, third, what underlies that is that if it's not written in the opinion, that it has been ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.493" offset="2253931">But that's not what this Court said in Castillo, where it said, if a court chooses to ignore in its opinion, which should be read as in its opinion writing, means that that claim has been impliedly rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.704" offset="2322790">So, therefore, just because a State court chooses not to write about it in its opinion does not mean that it didn't consider and reject that claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.048" offset="2380155">Why wouldn't you protect the same interests if you had a rule that said that there is a presumption that they have adjudicated the claim on the merits, but that it can be rebutted if there is a strong inference that they overlooked it or a very strong inference that they overlooked it.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.610" offset="2458417">Then you wouldn't have situations like the one that Justice Sotomayor posed in her hypothetical or the one that I just mentioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.260" offset="6077004">So their interpretation of what a claim is does not necessarily mean what it eventually becomes when it's in Federal habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.081" offset="6104275">And the Federal habeas courts are limited by their jurisdiction to only be Federal law theories, and a Federal petitioner can only bring such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.239" offset="6148893">So, for that reason, it's -- it's not the good fit for the state courts to limit them in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.745" offset="6182956">And that's why we're saying, at least in a situation where a state court has grappled with the substance of the error, that it has adjudicated the claim, which it could have viewed, as was here, sort of a single claim independent, or it could have state law theories and Federal law theories that it puts together.</text>

            <text syncTime="2816.552" offset="11374218">--But the threshold issue is when the foreperson, at the very, very, very beginning, says, Juror No. 6, 10 or 15 times has said he doesn't think there is sufficient evidence, all questioning should have stopped at that point, because there was no indication of bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.778" offset="11427090">But -- and how do we know that there's a possibility that he's being kicked off because of his views on the merits of the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.515" offset="11454048">We know that because the prosecutor filed a motion saying, let's reopen questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.086" offset="11472334">And that -- then the judge said, okay, yeah, let's reopen questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.471" offset="11489888">But the foreman had already said, I think your response to the jury note has satisfied that; I think it will be fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.160" offset="11520608">Yet, the prosecutor filed a motion to reopen because the prosecutor knew that this juror had reasonable doubts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.131" offset="11548507">And so that's why there's clear evidence in this case that the motion to dismiss the juror was based on the juror's views on the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.986" offset="11583929">And -- and, also, this is not a capital case, it's just a -- an LWOP case.</text>

            <label>Ms. Stephanie Brenan</label>
            <text syncTime="2889.817" offset="11667208">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.583" offset="11670342">I would just like to make about four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.269" offset="11681000">First, my friend discussed the case of Smith v. Digmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.756" offset="11698973">And I think I would like to point this Court to the words that were used in Smith v. Digmon, which is where the state court chooses to ignore in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.111" offset="11736380">And as this Court later said in Castille talking about that, that's an implicit rejection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.032" offset="11764070">So, really, the way it should be interpreted is, if a state court fails to mention in its opinion writing, it's implicitly rejected, not that it's been ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.656" offset="11802626">Secondly, I'd just like to agree that, yes, California believes that 1089 is Constitutional under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.362" offset="11845467">And, in fact, the Ninth Circuit in Miller v. Stagner said that it was facially constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.500" offset="11870022">Third, I would just like to agree with Justice Sotomayor that here, where the trial court made the finding of bias, that answered the Sixth Amendment question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.657" offset="11918610">The entire argument below and throughout was a disagreement as to whether the juror was biased, or was he just having -- harboring doubts about the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.750" offset="11970960">Those were the counterarguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.685" offset="11978692">The trial court, by making the determination that there was bias, necessarily answered that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.839" offset="12003351">Secondly, as to that point, I would just like to also point this Court to the language in People v. Cleveland that talks about agreeing with Thomas and Brown and Symington that you cannot dismiss a juror based on his views of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.467" offset="12073882">And that's at 21 P. 3d at page -- 1236.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.602" offset="12094362">So it couldn't have -- in order to have good cause in California, you couldn't have gotten rid of him for his views of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.708" offset="12122783">Finally, I'd just like to say that Mr. Chief Justice is correct that this would increase the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.945" offset="12155802">We would have courts, Federal habeas courts all the time trying to decide whether there was a sufficient indication or not by deciding whether state law is coterminous with Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.436" offset="12201673">As we've already seen in California, following the issuance of this decision that's exactly the type of arguments that we're getting all the time now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.625" offset="12234483">And for that reason, this Court should adopt the rule that where a fairly presented claim has been rejected by a state court, it has denied that claim, adjudicated that claim on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.535" offset="12290071">If there is anything else?</text>
