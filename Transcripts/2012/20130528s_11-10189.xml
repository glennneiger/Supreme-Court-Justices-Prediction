            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="109568">Justice Breyer has our opinion this morning in case 11-10189, Trevino versus Thaler which Justice Kennedy will announce.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="8.820" stopTime="222.576">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="8.820" offset="144781">In this opinion for the Court as the Chief Justice indicates by -- written by Justice Breyer, the bench announcement is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.239" offset="178427">Last year, in Martinez versus Ryan, the Court was faced with an Arizona prisoner who asserted that his trial lawyer provided constitutionally ineffective assistance, but before he came to the federal court seeking habeas release â€“ relief on that claim, the prisoner had procedurally defaulted that claim in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.954" offset="261287">Under Arizona state law, he was forbidden to raise the claim on direct repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.506" offset="279573">The state instead required him to raise a claim in a state habeas proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.511" offset="295560">But the petitioner had failed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.955" offset="305382">This was because he said of his lawyers default.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.778" offset="320637">So, under the rule that this Court had earlier said out in Coleman versus Thompson, the federal courts could not consider the merits or the petitioner's ineffective trial-counsel claim because that default took place during his first state habeas proceeding, rather than on state direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.617" offset="392004">But remember, that in the Martinez case in Arizona procedural rule prevented him from raising the inadequate trial-counsel claim on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.518" offset="427635">It required the prisoner to raise the claim of trial ineffectiveness in his state habeas proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.869" offset="456997">So on Martinez we reasoned that a narrow exception to the Coleman rule is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.584" offset="475805">Otherwise, the prisoner might be deprived of any review at all of his ineffective assistance of trial-counsel claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.134" offset="506002">And so, we decided that in Arizona a procedural default would not bar a federal habeas court from hearing the prisoner's substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if in the State's initial collateral review proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that initial collateral review proceeding was ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.173" offset="590221">In the case decided today, we are faced with the prisoner from Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.875" offset="605059">Like the prisoner in Martinez, he asserts that his trial lawyer provided ineffective assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.786" offset="624703">And like the prisoner in Martinez, he has procedurally defaulted that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.328" offset="642779">And like the prisoner in Martinez, this prisoner asserts that his procedural default is due to the ineffectiveness of his initial state habeas lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.353" offset="678933">But here at Texas, unlike Arizona, does not require prisoners to race ineffective assistance of trial-counsel claims on state collateral review, rather on its face, Texas law permits prisoners to bring such claims on direct review and we must decide whether this difference matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.775" offset="752598">We conclude that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.014" offset="761584">As explained in detail in today's opinion, the Court concludes that the Texas system does not offer most defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.970" offset="813411">As a practical matter, a typical defendant will not be able to race such a claim in Texas into state collateral review proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.543" offset="847684">And so, we conclude that the law should treat the Arizona and Texas systems similarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.596" offset="867850">The Martinez exception applied to the Arizona system should also apply in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.861" offset="888957">We vacate the Fifth Circuit's judgment to the contrary and remand the case before the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.677" offset="908184">Those proceedings can determine, in the first instance, where the Trevino's trial counsel ineffectiveness claim is substantial and whether he was provided ineffective assistance in his initial state habeas proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.171" offset="958234">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which he is joined by Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.547" offset="979655">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which he is joined by Justice Thomas.</text>
