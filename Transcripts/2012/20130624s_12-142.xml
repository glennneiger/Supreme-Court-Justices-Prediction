            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">Justice Alito also has our opinion this morning in case 12-142, Mutual Pharmaceutical Company versus Bartlett.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.462" offset="145345">In this case, we must determine whether New Hampshire's design-defect tort law cause of action was preempted by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.018" offset="187559">Responding Karen Bartlett was prescribed Clinoril, the brand name version of the pain reliever sulindac for shoulder pain.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.611" offset="225907">Her pharmacist dispensed a generic form of sulindac manufactured by petitioner Mutual Pharmaceutical.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.497" offset="257463">The results were disastrous.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.913" offset="263105">Respondent experienced a rare hypersensitivity reaction to sulindac and suffered severe and permanent injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.325" offset="296751">She sued Mutual Pharmaceutical and a federal jury ultimately retuned a large verdict against Mutual Pharmaceutical based on a New Hampshire design-defect tort law cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.587" offset="349832">The First Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.889" offset="359027">The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution provides that the laws and treaties of the United States are the supreme Law of the Land and we have long held that state laws that conflict with federal law are preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.221" offset="408346">That is without a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.542" offset="417646">One way that state laws can conflict with federal law is by requiring a private party to take an action that federal law prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.181" offset="452232">In such cases, there is what has been termed impossibility pre-emption.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.926" offset="475220">Here, state law imposes just such a duty. New Hampshire's design-defect cause of action requires a manufacturer to ensure that its products are not unreasonably dangerous to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.031" offset="527569">It may fulfill that duty in any or all of three ways by increasing the products' usefulness, by decreasing its risk of danger, or by strengthening the products' warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.184" offset="580232">Here, the first two avenues were close to Mutual by both federal law and basic chemistry.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.445" offset="605205">Changing sulindac's usefulness or risk of danger would have required Mutual to change sulindac's chemical composition, but federal law prohibits manufacturers from making such changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.202" offset="660271">The Federal Food and Drug Act fast tracks generic drugs to market on the assurance that their chemical composition is identical to that of their brand-name counterparts and federal law prohibits manufacturers from deviating from that approved design.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.104" offset="727876">Moreover, because sulindac is a one-molecule drug redesign, it was chemically impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.318" offset="752744">Thus, New Hampshire law ultimately required Mutual to strengthen its label.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.617" offset="773956">Unsurprisingly, allegations that sulindac's labeling was inadequate featured prominently at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.764" offset="802482">But as we recognized two terms ago in PLIVA, Inc. versus Mensing, federal law prohibits generic drug manufacturers from changing the labels that the FDA has approved for their drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.943" offset="859220">Accordingly, because it required Mutual to take actions that federal law prohibited New Hampshire's warning-based design-defect cause of action is pre-empted.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.146" offset="904046">The First Circuit solution that Mutual could have complied with both state and federal law by simply pulling sulindac from the market is no real solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.872" offset="946991">Our impossibility pre-emption cases have presumed that an actor seeking to satisfy conflicting state and federal law obligations is not required to cease acting altogether in order to avoid liability, at least where neither state law nor federal law imposes such an obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.100" offset="1031837">Indeed, if the option of ceasing to act defeated a claim of impossibility, impossibility pre-emption would be all but meaningless in every case including PLIVA in which we have found impossibility pre-emption would have been wrongly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.568" offset="1097770">This case arises out of tragic circumstances and we reach our conclusion only reluctantly, but the application of long standing pre-emption principles compels our result.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.865" offset="1138939">The judgment of the First Circuit is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.567" offset="1149701">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Kagan has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.318" offset="1168718">Justice Sotomayor has also filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg has joined.</text>
