            <text syncTime="8.120" offset="139394">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.889" offset="150470">This is a Sixth Circuit habeas appeal involving AEDPA deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.426" offset="168651">Harrington v. Richter holds that a Federal court may only overturn a State court conviction that is such an erroneous misapplication of this Court's clearly established precedent as to be beyond any possibility of fair-minded disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.852" offset="226329">That is, an extreme malfunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="237510">Here, a fair-minded jurist could conclude that the Michigan Supreme Court's Carpenter decision was neither indefensible nor unexpected when it simply applied plain statutory language in accord with well-established Michigan interpretive principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.231" offset="295920">Accordingly, the Michigan Court of Appeals application of Carpenter was not error, and the Sixth Circuit should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.635" offset="321520">I'd like to begin with the statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.087" offset="331342">In 1975, the Michigan legislature passed a comprehensive mental capacity affirmative defense statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.440" offset="360703">In it, the defenses are defined for mental illness and mental retardation, but it says nothing about diminished capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.677" offset="389647">And that silence is crucial here, because in Michigan, for over 200 years, it has been a code jurisdiction, which means that if the statutes address a particular area of criminal law, only that statute applies, and the Michigan courts are not allowed to either add to or subtract from that statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.389" offset="460491">So only the Michigan legislature had the power to add a diminished capacity defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="96.428" offset="492674">Actually, even before Michigan was a territory -- I'm -- before it was a State in 1810, it passed a law that abolished common law criminal principles when there was a statute that addressed the -- the subject matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="107.468" offset="536873">There was some law in effect in Michigan on this subject from the year 1973 till the year 2001.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.890" offset="570519">There was no statute and there was no ancient common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="121.427" offset="592671">If I asked you the question, what was the law in Michigan on diminished capacity from 1973 to 2001, what would you respond?</text>

            <text syncTime="133.285" offset="640109">In 1973, there was a Michigan Court of Appeals decision that recognized as a matter of common law the diminished capacity defense, but that was set aside by the 1975 statute which established all the comprehensive diminished capacity defenses available, and left out diminished capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.730" offset="709908">So in 1975, 1976, you know, 1978--</text>

            <text syncTime="161.086" offset="751286">Did it say -- it didn't say anything about the 1975 statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.656" offset="773542">--Well, what the Michigan Court of Appeals did beginning in 1978 in the Mangiapane case was to ask, is diminished capacity part of the statutory code, and it never held expressly that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.897" offset="826519">What it did in Mangiapane and in subsequent cases, it assumed that the defense existed, but it never held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.153" offset="851596">And that dicta could not override the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.955" offset="866747">And, in fact, counsel on the other side has not pointed to a single Michigan decision where a conviction or an exoneration on acquittal, or even a finding of ineffective assistance was ever based on the diminished capacity defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.596" offset="921291">Was the 1973 case that you mentioned based on a statute or was it based on allegedly a vacuum that the statutory structure allowed the court to fill?</text>
            <text syncTime="217.105" offset="975417">I mean, is that the way the 1973 case came about?</text>
            <text syncTime="219.974" offset="986806">And was the 1973 case followed by other courts, or was it just an isolated precedent?</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="226.278" offset="1012093">The 1973 case was a common law vacuum, Justice Kennedy, where the Michigan legislature had not yet spoken about mental incapacity defenses, and so it stood alone, as the court was able to do, as a common law decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.538" offset="1065069">There were no other cases that relied on it before the '75 statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.740" offset="1081892">And after that point, the Michigan appellate courts did not look to the '72 decision as the source of the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.679" offset="1113657">They assumed that if it existed, it must be somewhere within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.813" offset="1130166">And then in Carpenter, in 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court, when finally the very first Michigan court to look at the question explicitly says, well, it's not in the statute, diminished capacity isn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.871" offset="1174470">We've got mental retardation, we've got mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.473" offset="1184814">No diminished capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.773" offset="1190039">As the Michigan judiciary, we lack the power to add the diminished capacity defense.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="276.144" offset="1211564">Well, we don't -- well, we don't really have to reach this issue in this case, according to your submission, but what would happen if a State -- an intermediate State appellate court said the law is such-and-such, and then a -- a person is tried in the interim, is tried and subsequently, the State supreme court says that intermediate State court decision was incorrect, that never was the law of this State; the law was exactly the opposite.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="307.598" stopTime="364.435">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="307.598" offset="1337369">I think you would apply the same principles to that hypothetical as you did in Rogers.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.134" offset="1355446">And -- and in Rogers, you had a nearly 100-year common law history of the year and a day rule in the Tennessee Supreme Court that the defense was available to use that term for nearly 100 years, and yet it didn't violate due process in Rogers for the Tennessee Supreme Court to abolish the rule because it was neither indefensible nor unexpected.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.429" offset="1428693">Now, this case is much easier than Rogers or your hypothetical for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.165" offset="1443635">First, as I mentioned, it's a habeas case and so we've got the layer of AEDPA deference that wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.884" offset="1462444">Second, we're not talking about the evolution of the common law like we were in Rogers.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.688" offset="1481670">We're talking about a statute and the statute meant what it said in '75, just like it did in '01, just like it does today.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.609" offset="1505389">And the last thing is that in the Rogers case even the Tennessee Supreme Court acknowledged there was a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.179" offset="1531616">And here the Michigan Supreme Court said there was no change because the statute said what it said in 1975 and that meant no diminished capacity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="364.435" stopTime="387.634">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="364.435" offset="1564739">Well, what I'm wondering is how we even get beyond the statement, the holding by a State supreme court regarding the -- the law of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.326" offset="1608207">Don't we have to accept that as the -- as the law of the State?</text>
            <text syncTime="378.278" offset="1620014">Isn't that what our decision in Fiore says?</text>
            <text syncTime="380.980" offset="1630881">If the State supreme court says this is the law and it's always been the law, then how can we second-guess that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="387.634" stopTime="435.031">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="387.634" offset="1657526">Justice Alito, I would think about it in -- in two pieces.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.669" offset="1669647">And the first piece is can you second-guess the Michigan Supreme Court's interpretation of the statute, and I think the answer there everybody has to agree is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.006" offset="1699009">The State's interpretation of its own statute binds this Court, binds all Federal courts, just like the South Carolina Supreme Court decision in -- in Bouie did.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.529" offset="1729102">With respect to the Michigan Supreme Court's analysis of the retroactive effect, I agree that Fiore stands for that very proposition, and I think Indiana makes that case very forcefully in the -- the multi-State amici brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.153" offset="1775600">You don't have to reach that question here, however, because given the AEDPA standard and the fact that the Michigan Supreme Court decision was so clearly not a misapplication of Rogers and Bouie, it makes this a relatively easy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.811" offset="1830143">But I think you'd be fully within your right to follow the Fiore holding.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="435.031" offset="1847071">You -- you suggested, General, that the -- the fact that this is statutory makes your position easier.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="441.735" offset="1873924">And I wonder if that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.387" offset="1880507">I mean, you could see an -- an argument the exact other way, which suggests that we all understand that common law changes and evolves over time, but that it's rare for a court to reverse a decision on what a statute means, and that that's not foreseeable in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.932" offset="1958666">So -- now, especially if it were a single court saying the statute means A today, and then tomorrow it comes back and it says, no, it means B, whether that isn't actually -- whether that wouldn't cut against your position.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="479.827" stopTime="518.302">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="479.827" offset="2026271">Justice Kagan, I think this is the easiest case, because it's not just statutory interpretation; it's statutory interpretation of a statute that is just plain on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.783" offset="2066081">If you had an ambiguous statute, yes, then maybe there would be some more uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.154" offset="2079560">But where you've got a statute that enumerates several defenses, does not include diminished capacity, and under Michigan law it's not enumerated, it's not there, and the courts can't add it, that does make this easier.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.676" offset="2121670">I think it was probably a -- a bigger challenge in Rogers, for example, to acknowledge that, one, Tennessee law had changed right out from underneath the defendant; and yet, even given that change, this Court was comfortable that it was not indefensible or unexpected.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.535" offset="2177049">I think when--</text>

            <text syncTime="816.461" offset="3372831">If you look in the criminal law treatises, we're kind of in a category of only a very few States that, you know, on the one hand, define mental illness and mental retardation, do not define or mention diminished capacity, and yet still have this guilty but insane option, which is something that Michigan common law did not have, but then that was added in the '75 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.641" offset="3453497">So it's a little bit unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.576" offset="3461229">I think it's also unique to Michigan that we have this 200-year criminal code history, which if you're interested you can read all about it in the In Re Lamphere case that we cite on page 4 to 5 of our reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.019" offset="3527058">Well, General, I guess I wonder whether it's relevant what the statute really says as opposed to what courts said it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.692" offset="3557673">I mean, sometimes judges make errors and our law is dotted with places where courts have made errors and said that things mean what they don't mean or don't mean what they do mean, and, you know, we expect people to follow what the court says is the law even if there's really a better reading out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.903" offset="3634578">And also, we think that people should rely on what the court says is the law, even though there's really a better reading out there.</text>

            <text syncTime="907.137" offset="3735515">And I concede that this would be a more difficult case if the Michigan Supreme Court in, say, 1990 had come out in a published opinion and and said the exact opposite of what it said in 2001.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.509" offset="3776997">Obviously, that's not what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.111" offset="3783371">But -- but ultimately, you know, the question that would have been on Mr. Lancaster's mind back in 1993 when he shot and killed Toni King was, does Michigan law prohibit me, will it punish me if I -- I kill someone?</text>
            <text syncTime="931.169" offset="3831645">And -- and clearly, he had to know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.538" offset="3841154">And if he had looked at the 1975 statute, he would have seen that diminished capacity was not mentioned there.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.775" offset="3866022">So to the extent that he -- he wanted to rely on that defense, he wouldn't have found it in Michigan's codified law.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.846" offset="3886293">Now, I know the argument on the other side is, well, we have these other cases which, you know, mention the doctrine, kind of assume without deciding that -- that it's out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.582" offset="3917327">And he wants to assume that he has all the knowledge of that, but not the knowledge of the background principle that Michigan won't add affirmative defenses to a statute through a judicial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.307" offset="3960168">And if you're going to impute any knowledge to him, and -- and we submit that you probably shouldn't, then you've got to impute all the knowledge of Michigan law, the plain language of the statute and the interpretive principles that should guide what that statute means.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.215" offset="4007815">He knew that killing someone was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.915" offset="4014607">Unquestionably, he was on fair notice of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.583" offset="4025265">And -- and just like in Rogers, this diminished capacity defense after 1975 was never relied on by any Michigan court to either hold someone guilty or to acquit them or to find that there was ineffective assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.160" offset="4075629">It just was not the kind of well-established principle that could possibly make the Carpenter decision either indefensible or unexpected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.313" offset="4108230">And then when you layer that on top with AEDPA deference, you know, really, this is about as simple as it gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.467" offset="4132785">There is no decision of -- of this Court, not Rogers, not Bouie, not Fiore, not Bunkley, any Court decision that is contrary to or misapplied in this Michigan Court of Appeals opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3440.117" offset="13867368">And Bouie is really the perfect analogy, because, again, under the AEDPA standard, it's Lancaster's burden to show that the court of appeals decision here was contrary to our misapplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.456" offset="13904775">And, to the contrary, it was the exact application of Bouie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.907" offset="13918568">In Bouie, you had a clear statute that was very narrow, and the State court expanded it in a very unexpected way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.430" offset="13948661">And this Court found that was indefensible and unexpected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.482" offset="13960886">The exact opposite happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.498" offset="13968932">You had the Michigan Supreme Court applying very narrow statutory language exactly the way it was written in accord with 200 years of interpretive principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.488" offset="14000906">So -- so really, the problem here is not any unfairness, the problem is the Sixth Circuit yet again not applying habeas deference under the statute or this Court's precedent and disregarding another Michigan State court decision where reasonable jurists could have reached different conclusions on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.382" offset="14068511">It's not our burden to -- to demonstrate what the law was or wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.401" offset="14080527">All we have to show is that a reasonable jurist could have reached the conclusion the Michigan Court of Appeals did here, and there doesn't appear to be any question that's the case.</text>
