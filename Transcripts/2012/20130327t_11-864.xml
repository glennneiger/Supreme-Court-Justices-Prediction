            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">As you have just heard, Justice Breyer and I joined by Justices Sotomayor and Kagan think this case is not fit for the Court's review.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.323" offset="155711">We would dismiss the writ as in providently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.346" offset="171802">We dissent on grounds both procedural and substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.655" offset="193014">I will note the procedural slips, Justice Breyer, the substantive fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.364" offset="215897">First, the Court wrote its own question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.951" offset="234287">Comcast question concerned Rule 23's prerequisites for cross-action certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.714" offset="265320">The revised question instead of focusing on Rule 23 as whether the plaintiff's class had introduced admissible evidence including expert testimony showing the damages could be proved on a class-wide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.526" offset="336583">In fact, Comcast raised no objection to the admission of the damages model designed by plaintiff's expert, so no question of admissibility was preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.094" offset="390813">Realizing that the question it framed was in inept, the Court addressed a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.437" offset="420174">“Did plaintiff fail to show the damages could be awarded on a class-wide basis?”</text>
            <text syncTime="86.893" offset="454029">The Court settled on that question, however, after briefing an argument ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.376" offset="479943">Understandably, plaintiffs followed the Court's instruction and trained their written and oral arguments on admissibility, not Rule 23 requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.857" offset="525918">Thus, the plaintiffs had no unclouded opportunity to be brief and argue with precision the issue the Court decides against them today and that's not rigid.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.876" offset="577954">Second, the Court's ruling is good for this day in case only for it depends on an oddity, the plaintiff's failure to oppose the need to prove damages on a class-wide basis through a common methodology.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.223" offset="643365">In the mine run of cases, class-certification under Rule 23 (b)(3) is proper when liability questions come into the class predominate even if damages are not provable in the aggregate.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.531" offset="704596">That is black letter law and nothing in the Court's opinion today disturbs the legions of federal court decisions that have treated liability on the class basis, damages in smaller units or individually.</text>
