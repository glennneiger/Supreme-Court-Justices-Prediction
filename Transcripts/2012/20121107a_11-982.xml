            <text syncTime="1827.432" offset="7415522">So we think there could be circumstances in which it would be particularly appropriate for a district court to consider the existence of the TTAB proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.037" offset="7657938">You will want to have available to you the cert petition and the small volume of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.243" offset="7682703">In our submission the Court needs to adopt a rule that has balance to it, and that is there -- it has to be possible to resolve one of these cases through a covenant not to sue of appropriate breadth, but it also has to be the case that a covenant not to sue can't just always eliminate the other side's injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.271" offset="7762846">And so, it's going to depend on the covenant and it's going to depend on what the other side says about its plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.259" offset="7782804">And our point in this case is that you should adopt the following rule: And that is, if you have a covenant not to sue and it covers everything that the other side alleges an intent to produce, then there is no more injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.317" offset="7835049">If it doesn't cover that, then there may well be injury, and our point--</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.861" offset="7901191">So one thing that's very important to recognize -- two things about trademark practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.980" offset="7921671">First is that in all of these cases, remember, most of the time the question of trademark or patent validity will just be a suit for invalidity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.086" offset="7950092">It might be a counterclaim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.069" offset="7958033">And in all of these cases, including this case, there is a protective order, and there is one in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.740" offset="7980707">And the protective order says that a party can designate its material so that it's lawyers' eyes only, and so that no business person from the other side is entitled to see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.112" offset="8018219">So that, Justice Kennedy, with respect, it's actually not true that this is an unusual situation or that we would get some special advantage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.614" offset="13604244">Your Honor, the covenant -- the affidavits in this case were prepared about five weeks after this completely unexpected development in the middle of a hard pressed litigation was made, and the position that the Petitioner made to the district court was there is obviously subject matter jurisdiction here, not just because of the Rule 41 point, but that you can't say, well, we have a case that raises these three issues, you could, say, enter a single judgment right now, the plaintiff's claims are waived because they've waived them, the trademark is invalid, and the registration was unlawfully issued and should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.060" offset="13778010">Courts issue judgments on the basis of alternative holdings all the time, and the only reason why we're even talking about this is that Judge Sullivan bifurcated the proceedings so that we dealt with this one issue in isolation and then the other thing came up separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.201" offset="13826598">So we said we think there's a case right now, but if you doubt it, we request leave to amend our counterclaim to assert claims for invalid procurement of registration and other things that could have been asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.676" offset="13872469">So the state of the record reflects the -- the suddenness with which the -- the plaintiff most unexpectedly did what it now says in public it's never done before and dropped its claim so unexpectedly in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.685" offset="13940492">So there's no question but that if -- if it turns out that it's not enough to say that we're actively engaged and we want to do all of the things any person in a normal position would want to do, and we have a concrete interest, the -- the defendant can certainly allege more than what it has been alleged.</text>
