            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="155612">This case concerns who counts and who does not count as a supervisor under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.276" offset="175465">The parties and the United States agree that the Seventh Circuit rule violates the holding of Faragher, the reasoning of Faragher and this Court's other central Title VII precedents, including Burlington Northern and Staub, and the common-sense meaning of the word “ supervisor ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.935" offset="230113">The parties even agree as to the general legal standard, although they style it a little bit different -- differently, that those harassers whose employer-conferred authority over their victims enables or materially augments the harassment should count as supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.045" offset="294479">This is not a standard, Your Honor, that imposes automatic liability on employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.283" offset="315481">Victims must still prove actionable harassment, and employers can still take advantage of the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="83.404" offset="439928">Now, that affects the daily activities of that other employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="127.449" offset="616098">So in this case, someone's intense dislike -- maybe it's debilitating, subjective -- dislike of rock music, some forms of country music -- might impair the performance of some in the workplace; but, from an objective reasonable employee's standpoint, I don't believe that that would be the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.924" offset="778057">And I would have thought the benefit of the Seventh Circuit's test was that you don't have to go through those case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.097" offset="806688">I think we can have a reasonable debate about whether the music you have to listen to for eight hours is objectively a significant enough interference with the daily activities to qualify under your test.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.054" offset="850573">But the Seventh Circuit test makes clear -- it doesn't give any kind of immunity; it just makes clear what type of analysis is going to be applied to the allegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.410" offset="887981">Well, Your Honor, the Respondent actually exaggerates the determinativeness of the Seventh Circuit rule, and the indeterminativeness -- both indeterminativeness and unpredictability of the Second Circuit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.885" offset="933852">The Seventh Circuit itself has recognized -- the judges in the Seventh Circuit itself have recognized that the rule does not really well fit the realities of the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.657" offset="968960">It also just moves uncertainty from one category to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.776" offset="985470">The category of supervisor may be a little bit tidier; but, under the Seventh Circuit's approach, the category of co-worker is very unpredictable.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.064" offset="1026639">The Seventh Circuit itself, in Doe v. Oberweis Dairy, recognized that once you move people who can take -- have this kind of power over their victims but can't actually take annual employment actions against them into the category of co-workers, all of a sudden you have to apply a sliding scale of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.062" offset="1106573">Not only that, but the jury is the one who applies it.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.664" offset="1117022">So for those categories -- this exact category of employee, Your Honor, the employer going forward has very little idea of whether -- what standard of care is that a particular jury would apply in that case and whether the jury would decide it is met or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.958" offset="1190165">The Seventh Circuit rule, in the overall, is no more determinative than the Second Circuit rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.529" offset="1212421">Also, Respondent points to no cases in the Second Circuit or the other circuits that have adopted this rule where courts have identified problems with its application.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.509" offset="1716376">Mr. Ortiz, why isn't the question that you're presenting academic in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="407.580" offset="1736647">Because didn't the district judge say that there had been no showing that Davis' conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive?</text>
            <text syncTime="420.971" offset="1790250">It wouldn't matter if the supervisor -- if the conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive harassment, and, equally, if the company responded every time a complaint was lodged.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.932" offset="1862035">The district court found both of those things, that it wasn't severe and pervasive, and that every time she complained an investigation was made.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel R. Ortiz</label>
            <text syncTime="449.490" offset="1904353">--Justice Ginsburg, we actually tried to bring those things up before the Seventh Circuit, but the Seventh Circuit found it unnecessary to reach them because of its holding as to supervisory liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.132" offset="1950851">If this Court were to reverse the Seventh Circuit's affirmance of summary judgment of the district court, the case would then be remanded to the Seventh Circuit, where it could either look at these alternative -- these other holdings, or the thing would be -- it could be remanded at that point and sent back to the district court for another look.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.510" offset="2032353">The district court's reasoning, the Seventh Circuit noted, when it was talking about other incidents of harassment was very unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.817" offset="2069656">What the district court did was it divided all of the incidents into two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.905" offset="2097973">One category -- one category consisted of events that by themselves were not overtly racial in nature and the other category consisted of those events that were overtly racial in nature, where a racial epithet had been hurled at someone, for example, and said with respect to the first category, the things -- the events that on their face did not announce racial animosity, that there wasn't any racial nexus, so they didn't count, and swept all those events out and then looked at the remaining ones where the connection to racial animus was overt.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.013" offset="2250423">And it said, well, these, there may be some, but they just don't count.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.548" offset="2268500">So the Seventh Circuit itself discredited the reasoning of the district court in those very holdings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.732" offset="5573303">And on the other end, you have harassment that's perpetrated by a supervisor with authority over tangible employment actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.323" offset="9759687">And I think our position takes into account that there have to be limits in this area, on the extent of vicarious liability, in order to give effect to Congress's intent; but, also recognizes, in the situation like you had with the lifeguard in Faragher, that that person did have authority that would assist in the harassment -- they made her clean the toilets, as the lifeguard in Faragher said.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.930" offset="9902106">And the best way to make clear that there are limits is to make clear that on the record in this case Ms. Davis did not qualify as a supervisor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.840" offset="11009698">But you're saying this is an extremely weak case under those standards; and, therefore, what is -- what benefit is there in our applying this?</text>

            <text syncTime="2745.837" offset="11089737">And I think the damaging signal that this Court would send by remanding on this record would be that, whatever it might say in its opinion, that would have virtually no force in terms of establishing a standard that made clear that this -- whatever else may be true about what would qualify, something like this does not qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.398" offset="11163925">And, again, like this Court did in the Global Tech case, when the Court establishes a standard, oftentimes, it applies the standard to the facts and appreciates that that's the best way, the most judicial way of providing guidance on what that standard means.</text>

            <text syncTime="2820.235" offset="11387324">So that that piece of evidence, even in its reasonable inference, would not be sufficient to create a material issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.472" offset="11408222">It also wouldn't be sufficient creating -- looking at the body of the evidence, which makes crystal clear that the prep sheets are really what was driving the daily activities in this workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.514" offset="11448451">And it was Kimes or the chef that did the prep sheets, not Ms. Davis at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.035" offset="11486485">Ms. Davis was asked at her deposition on page 135, quote, “ Was there ever ” --</text>

            <text syncTime="2855.725" offset="11529221">And her response was yes, and she pointed to an example by Mr. Kimes, because it was Mr. Kimes who had the authority to make those assignments, not Ms. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.931" offset="11566106">So the mere fact that you've got some marginal evidence drawn from snippets, giving it a reasonable inference that she at times had some ability to lead or direct, as the job description says,</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.920" offset="11702048">So what's the best place in the record for us to look to decide that question as to whether she at all didn't present or didn't develop evidence because of the nature of the Seventh Circuit standard?</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.180" offset="11759099">--Well, first, I would look at her summary judgment briefs, Your Honor, and in those briefs she argued that Davis was a supervisor because, one, under the job description she had the authority to lead and direct, the same sorts of things that we are talking now and would be talking about under the EEOC and Second Circuit tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.373" offset="11823883">And, two, she points to the fact that they didn't clock in, again something that is irrelevant under the Seventh Circuit test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.593" offset="11844676">So this wasn't a case where the litigant felt themselves bound by the legal standard and one could surmise that they would have pursued it differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.949" offset="11874142">I think I would look at that first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.116" offset="11878844">And then I would look at her deposition transcript which is in the Joint Appendix and the three affidavits that she put in, in this case, which are in the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.889" offset="11913953">At some point you would expect her to come along and try to rebut the notion that Mr. Kimes and Ms. Fultz assigned the daily activities through the prep sheets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.696" offset="11957107">In fact, it's just the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.596" offset="11964735">If anything, in her own affidavit she seems to accept that the prep sheets were done by Kimes and the chef.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.283" offset="11987514">That's at JA 430.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.718" offset="11993261">You would expect her to contest the notion that Mr. Kimes was the one who did the scheduling, who did her annual reviews, who disciplined her on occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.408" offset="12027951">After all, she was claiming that Davis was the supervisor, and she didn't feel bound by the Seventh Circuit tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.626" offset="12048849">So you would expect to see some indication of how Ms. Davis actually assigned her something to do, changed her schedule, the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.232" offset="12083226">Instead what you find is all those sorts of allegations, she made them, but all those sorts of allegations were directed to Mr. Kimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.321" offset="12111648">That was the basis for her retaliation claim, which isn't before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.689" offset="12125127">But there are all the sorts of things that you might expect one to complain about against a supervisor in this sort of vein: She made me cut vegetables instead of doing the baking like I like to do; she didn't assign me enough overtime so I could make more money; she changed my hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.199" offset="12191164">Those allegations were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.668" offset="12197016">They were directed at Mr. Kimes and that's perfectly consistent with the record evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.703" offset="12213107">There was Kimes and the chef who had the authority to do her daily activities, and Kimes had the authority to do the schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.107" offset="12238812">It's not enough for her to come here today, I don't think, and just speculate that having an opportunity to go through greater discovery, which in essence would amount to a fishing expedition, the Court should take the unusual step of remanding to give her an opportunity for discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.302" offset="12303595">This Court -- although we acknowledge oftentimes this Court does remand for the lower courts to undertake that inquiry, it certainly doesn't always do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.408" offset="12335987">So Global-Tech is one example; we've cited many more in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.360" offset="12347795">And here, I think, again, the parties -- there is broad agreement on what the standard should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.430" offset="12372036">Something like the EEOC or Second Circuit test is, we think, the best way to frame it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.632" offset="12388859">But given the debate among the parties about what that test means and how it applies to Davis here, I think it's absolutely critical for the Court to apply the legal test to the record facts and hold that Ms. Davis is not a supervisor and to affirm the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.760" offset="12453434">Although it's not before this Court, if one wants to go to the next step and think about the affirmative defenses and the like, this isn't a case where the Court would be putting to rest a valid Title VII claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.533" offset="12496484">But the claim was extensively looked at below by Judge Barker in the district court, Judge Wood and her colleagues on the court of appeals, and they found an environment in which Ball State reacted responsibly to the allegations that were made, investigated them and took prompt action where the investigation warranted it, particularly with respect to the most despicable things that were uncovered, racial epithets that were used by another employee, Ms. McVicker, not Ms. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.783" offset="12601496">The only allegations against Ms. Davis that we think are relevant here during the time period that Ms. Davis was a part-time employee were: One, the so-called elevator incident where Ms. Davis allegedly blocked Ms. Vance as she got out of the elevator, which isn't race-based at all, we don't think; and two, the alleged use of words like “ Sambo ” or “ Buckwheat ” to refer--</text>

            <text syncTime="3162.909" offset="12758021">If you look on page JA 12, the job description position function, the last sentence says</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.545" offset="12780487">"Requires leadership of up to 20 part-time substitute and student employees. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.366" offset="12795847">So we think it's clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.049" offset="12798564">We said this is in our red brief and there wasn't any response to it in the yellow brief, that any authority, any conceivable supervisory authority, could have only existed when Ms. Vance was a part-time employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.591" offset="12848719">But we don't think that that's relevant, Your Honor, because putting aside whether she had authority over catering assistants who were part time or full time, the record is absolutely clear that Ms. Davis just lacked the authority that would have been sufficient to trigger vicarious liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.219" offset="12915174">And again we think the paradigm case where that authority is present is something like the lifeguard in Silverman where they control all aspects of the daily activities, one's schedule, one's daily work assignments, and down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.693" offset="12961150">Here there is no evidence that any of that authority that was possessed, and the record makes clear beyond doubt that all that authority was possessed by others, Ms. -- the chef and Mr. Kimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.418" offset="13008066">And I think, as the amicus brief makes clear, this is consistent with workplaces across America today, where jobs are less hierarchical, more collaborative, and so where you have got more senior employees by virtue of their experience or job title, just a paper title, are in a broad sense team leaders of the like in the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.396" offset="13087896">That doesn't mean they are supervisors in any traditional sense, and it certainly doesn't mean they are supervisors for purposes of triggering vicarious liability under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.020" offset="13126453">So for those reasons, we would urge this Court to affirm the judgment below, to make clear in order to provide the needed guidance to the courts of appeals and the assumption that something like the EEOC or Second Circuit standard does apply to determine who is a supervisor triggering vicarious liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.565" offset="13204611">Ms. Davis, the only employee who is at issue, does not meet that standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.994" offset="13482345">Well, Justice Kennedy, that in fact is one thing the Seventh Circuit has tried to do, but it dispels any kind of certainty and predictability in the rule, because the duty of care of course would be determined by a jury only after hearing a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.271" offset="13547442">Second, my friend tries to get out from under the clear import of the job description here by saying directing and leading somehow don't count because that is accomplished through oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.598" offset="13600732">Oversight, however, is a common synonym for supervision itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.383" offset="13619853">It's merely a dog chasing its own tail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.002" offset="13630302">Third, it's no surprise that many of the things that Ms. Vance referred to, the particular instance she referred to went back to William Kimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.940" offset="13666142">Of course, that related to the retaliation part of her claim, which is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.761" offset="13689339">Also, Your Honor, Faragher in the end is not a toilet cleaning case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.729" offset="13705221">The district court did not find -- made no finding on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.033" offset="13722462">The court of appeals didn't mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.152" offset="13730926">This Court in its Faragher opinion mentioned only that it was an allegation in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.104" offset="13746808">It is not clear -- the allegation of the complainant was that he said that, not that Silverman actually had that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.008" offset="13774394">And it was clear from the case that he actually wasn't interested in even dating Faragher, it was just a way of humiliating her in the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.863" offset="13801770">So just as Faragher's expressed, it was not clear that was even something that Silverman had authority to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.434" offset="13824131">And finally, if this Court is worried about sending signals, think about what kind of signal it will be sending to litigants in the future if it were to affirm, simply affirm here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.242" offset="13871360">In the future, whenever anyone is thinking that they may want to challenge a rule, no matter how well-settled it is in a particular circuit, they would have an incentive to, through discovery, to produce information that might be relevant to any future twist.</text>
