            <text syncTime="6.737" offset="133188">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.456" offset="144055">The Fifth Amendment prohibits using a person's silence during a noncustodial police interview against him at trial, and nothing about the specific facts of this case give this Court cause to refrain from applying that rule here.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.846" offset="197658">To the contrary, the State's closing argument in this case urging the jury to find Mr. Salinas guilty because, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="29.769" offset="225348">"an innocent person would have denied law enforcement's accusations. "</text>
            <text syncTime="33.387" offset="239872">strikes at the core of everything the Griffin rule, and indeed the Fifth Amendment, is designed to prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.106" offset="258680">It evokes an inquisitorial system of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.208" offset="271114">It effectively shifts the burden of proof onto the defendant, and it demeans individual dignity by conscripting the defendant as a product of his own demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.033" offset="310403">Now, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals resisted this logic and held the Fifth Amendment didn't apply, because there was supposedly no compulsion in this case in the sense that there was no physical or psychological coercion of the kind that's inherent in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.406" offset="363901">But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals simply misunderstood the nature of a Griffin claim and the nature of the compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.679" offset="392950">The compulsion that Mr. Salinas faced was when the police asked him the question about ballistics evidence, there was nothing he could do to avoid supplying the State with incriminating evidence that it could use against him.</text>

            <text syncTime="88.974" offset="462226">There was a case of someone who was given Miranda warnings and even so, the Court said he was silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.414" offset="495976">He didn't invoke the Fifth Amendment, therefore, his silence can be commented on.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.935" offset="542056">The Berghuis case was about whether his subsequent statements could be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.773" offset="557416">This Court didn't hold that his silence that preceded those statements could be used against him, and indeed, that would be contrary to Miranda itself in footnote 37 where the Court said, if somebody stands mute in a custodial setting in the face of law enforcement accusations, they may not be--</text>

            <text syncTime="161.554" offset="752499">So where is -- there's the tax case; then we have a case they're selling tickets to the policeman's ball and somebody comes to the door and the policeman says, hey, I haven't seen you around before, and he doesn't answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.887" offset="857825">--Well, it's sufficient to decide this case to say that a noncustodial police interview during the investigation of a crime where they're interviewing somebody about -- who is -- who is, as the State concedes, a suspect in a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.831" offset="917593">Now, it may well be that Griffin extends a little bit further, and remember, the Solicitor General at least agrees that Griffin applies in a noncustodial setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.151" offset="942879">Well, but it's -- it's well settled that when you're -- wherein you're examining the witness and he takes -- and he suddenly says I don't want any more questions, that that's -- he's waived if you're in court, if you're examining a witness on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.811" offset="1001498">So against that background, suppose in this case the facts were just about the same, and he said what -- the police said, what would you do if we matched the shotgun shells, and he said -- he said “ Well ” -- and then he starts to cry.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.264" offset="1115287">But the State -- what the State would not be able to do would be to argue that his silence and refusal to answer the question demonstrated his guilt.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="259.418" offset="1143918">Or the prosecution could say, Well, he said, well, and started to cry, and he never told us anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.603" offset="1156665">That -- that final sentence that I used is impermissible?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="266.673" stopTime="312.904">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="266.673" offset="1172966">I think that may well cross the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.289" offset="1179444">You have the exact issue that arises already in custodial settings, where under Doyle and footnote 37 of Miranda you've held that silence can't be used against a criminal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.231" offset="1219255">So, Justice Kennedy, you're right that questions will arise in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.849" offset="1233674">One is whether words that the defendant uses are tantamount to refusing to answer the question, and then there is a second question about physical demeanor evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.622" offset="1268783">The law is already sorted out on this in the lower courts, and I think it's a very workable test.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.026" offset="1290412">The Solicitor General agrees with what it is, and the reason why this Court hasn't seen a case, itself seen a case like that, is because once the rule is established that the prosecution can't use silence against the defendant, the temptation drops away to try to introduce that evidence for some supposedly different purpose.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="312.904" stopTime="333.032">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="312.904" offset="1357913">Mr. Fisher, but then -- do -- do I understand correctly that you're saying demeanor is different, so, although it was impermissible to comment on silence, it was okay to say he looked down, he seemed to be sweating, he was very nervous, he was shuffling his feet.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="333.032" stopTime="381.882">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="333.032" offset="1438370">Insofar as demeanor evidence that the State offers has communicative values and the State argues that it has communicative value, independent of simply what the defendant looked like when he remains silent, then it -- then it may well be able to introduce that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.641" offset="1496884">Now, as I said, as I was just finishing up telling Justice Kennedy, you're not going to have hard cases in this respect because once the temptation -- once it's clear that silence can't be used, then the prosecution I think has little motivation to try to walk that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.718" offset="1553204">And indeed, I think it would be appropriate in a case if the prosecution said, look, the fact that the defendant started we think is relevant for some reason independent of what he -- of failing to answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.026" offset="1594373">The jury could be instructed, as they are in Griffin, Griffin settings already, that you aren't to consider the defendant's refusal to answer the question against him, but--</text>

            <text syncTime="385.767" offset="1649335">The first is your rule would be seen to be giving noncustodial defendants more rights than those defendants in custody, because you're arguing that -- I think -- that a greater degree of expression other than silence would be needed to show the invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.676" offset="1805025">And I -- and this is where Justice Ginsburg's question came from, so I think it's very important for me to be clear on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.545" offset="1824460">A person in a noncustodial setting still has fewer rights than a person in a custodial setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.266" offset="1843372">What the Court held in Berghuis is that if the defendant wants to exercise his prophylactic right under Miranda to cut off police questioning -- those are the words this Court used -- that has to be expressly invoked in some manner during the interrogation.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.584" offset="1952669">I have a hard time understanding how the refusal to come talk to them could be held against them.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.122" offset="1994778">But here, your defendant went in and talked.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.426" offset="2007944">So once he chose to do that, why does he get more rights than Berghuis did, who remained silent for 2-1/2 hours?</text>
            <text syncTime="486.949" offset="2054128">The Court wasn't willing to find that that was an invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.555" offset="2084535">Why would it find the refusal to ask one -- answer one question indicative of the privilege against silence -- or the privilege for silence?</text>

            <text syncTime="572.222" offset="2395183">And this Court said in Miranda itself and it's never questioned since that that right doesn't have to be expressly invoked.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.995" offset="2534259">And so, ask yourself whether there's any good reason to require an express invocation in that setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.549" offset="2556515">Mr. Salinas, remember, did expressly invoke his right to -- Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, at trial in a timely manner, asking for the evidence to be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.571" offset="2592564">So the question is whether there's a reason to ask him to do it sooner.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.957" offset="2606148">And our argument is it's unnecessary, unfair, and a rule like that would be unadministrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.027" offset="2630390">So let me walk through those if I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.295" offset="2635510">It's unnecessary because all the cases the Solicitor General cites for an express invocation principle involve a scenario where the Government has no good reason to know that it's seeking incriminatory information.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.436" offset="2683993">And, Justice Breyer, this is the limiting principle that you were searching for in the tax cases and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.305" offset="2703532">If the Government doesn't know or have good reason to know that the defendant who is silent is likely to be exercising his rights, then the Government needs to be put on notice, because the Government may -- may well challenge, may well go seek a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.065" offset="2754523">It may well decide to grant immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.765" offset="2761315">It may do a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.850" offset="2765704">But here, the Government would do absolutely nothing different.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.886" offset="2777825">Police would have done absolutely nothing different.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.702" offset="2785139">Indeed, look at the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.920" offset="2793916">What the Solicitor General says is that Mr. Salinas should have said,</text>
            <text syncTime="675.555" offset="2808545">"I refuse to answer that question. "</text>
            <text syncTime="677.741" offset="2817217">and if he had said that everything would be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.359" offset="2827666">But look at what the State argued at trial and what the officer testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.745" offset="2841250">The officer testified: When we asked him that question, he wouldn't answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.513" offset="2856296">The prosecution argued to the jury: He refused to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.084" offset="2870612">So there is no ambiguity in the setting whether he was remaining silent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2452.161" offset="9914896">In your hypothetical, if it was as probative as it was in our case, you know, that might be something the prosecution would want to use without violating the Fifth Amendment right, because there's no clear indication that the defendant did in fact rely upon his Fifth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.302" offset="9963483">Now, I don't want to, you know, misread footnote 37, but that's how we read footnote 37, because of the absence of -- there's many, many cases cited there, and it's not clear that it's attempted to apply an -- an extension of Griffin in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.911" offset="10025968">The rule we're -- we're offering here would not -- would not change the law with regard to how it exists in much of the Federal Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.969" offset="10070167">In much of the Federal Circuits, these defendants where -- where the courts have held that we cannot utilize this evidence, those defendants have in fact done something to invoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.475" offset="10104231">So I think the -- the rule that we're asking the Court to adopt would allow for these -- that case law to stand; i.e., if a defendant says I don't want to talk anymore, I plead the Fifth, you know, we're not asking this Court to issue a rule that says that we can introduce that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.019" offset="10170373">All we're asking this Court to -- to introduce is consistent with this Court's case law that would require an invocation, or some invocation that the Fifth Amendment right was being relied upon, and not just a difficulty with the question, or I can't think up an exculpatory answer for that particular question, so I don't know what to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.100" offset="10254696">I mean, there, the defendant is not relying upon a constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.085" offset="13046664">I think this case is a good example of that, where you have a -- a suspect who speaks for, you know, several minutes, you know, half an hour, whatever, and he's answering questions in an exculpatory manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.304" offset="13567545">And so the question is whether you want a broad, prophylactic rule that will protect a great deal of conduct that -- that has nothing to do with the exercise of the right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="3375.826" offset="13609550">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.064" offset="13626582">I'd like to make three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.247" offset="13631284">First, Justice Breyer, your question about the state of the law with respect to question number 432.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.967" offset="13654167">In our reply brief at page 4, we cite cases that are all Fifth Amendment cases, and Canterbury also, which is a Tenth Circuit case cited elsewhere in our brief, uniformly holding that the Fifth Amendment applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.208" offset="13703069">The Solicitor General, when they speak about a circuit split with relation to Doyle, they're talking about impeachment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.095" offset="13722713">Remember, Doyle and Jenkins, which are the cases the State cited to you in response to your question are impeachment cases that are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.916" offset="13745910">Second, if I -- we can look at the transcript this afternoon, but I believe both the State and the Solicitor General said to you today if Mr. Salinas would have said, I don't want to answer that question, then he would win, then Griffin would apply; but because it was somehow ambiguous, that it shouldn't, that is ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.496" offset="13824277">If you look at the transcript in this case, what did the officer testify when he said -- he asked him the question, he said he did not answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.583" offset="13856564">What did the prosecutor argue to the jury in closing?</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.685" offset="13865028">Verbatim of what the State is telling you today is all Mr. Salinas had to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.137" offset="13882791">At closing the State said, the police officer testified that he wouldn't answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.708" offset="13901077">He didn't want to answer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.493" offset="13908287">So the whole principle behind express invocation jurisprudence is to put the State and the police on fair notice that somebody is exercising the right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.116" offset="13946739">There was zero ambiguity in this case that was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.468" offset="13960114">So it explains why the rule that the State and the Solicitor General have fallen back on in court today is formalism of the absolute worst kind, and the only thing that this formal requirement of saying some sort of magic words -- and I agree with Justice Kagan, I don't know what they are -- but whatever they are, what -- exactly what the State argued to the jury apparently would have been enough, is just nothing more than a trap for the unwary, who is told through culture and learning that he has a right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.403" offset="14079859">And he does the one thing that is consistent with his right, which is exercising it, and somehow the State is telling you that it can walk into court and say, because he remains silent, he's guilty of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.895" offset="14125834">Jury, you should conclude he's guilty of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.830" offset="14133567">And, Justice Sotomayor, when you asked the State, well, what about an officer that tells the defendant, as he will have every incentive to do, in South Carolina v. Neville in a roughly comparable situation that law enforcement actually admitted they were already doing it, but the States tell you they'll do it here, when the officer says, if you don't answer, we're going to use that against you, the State said that would be coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.093" offset="14218621">But the officer would be doing nothing more than stating the rule the Court is asking you to announce today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.647" offset="14240878">So wouldn't the defendant know the law?</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.766" offset="14249341">Don't we assume that the suspect knows the law?</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.516" offset="14260313">And the State's telling you, well, if the officer tells the person what the law is, it's coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.603" offset="14280688">So really, what we're asking today is nothing radical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.657" offset="14296884">It's nothing of a departure of our deepest traditions, which require the Government to shoulder the load itself, to prove the case itself, and not to enlist the defendant as an instrument in his own demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.981" offset="14346203">People's silence, it is the time-honored concept of the Fifth Amendment which, remember, was created for out-of-court questioning by law enforcement authorities, that people who remain silent could not have that used against them at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.307" offset="14407539">And finally, I hope the -- the confusion with respect to the Berghuis as related to this case has been dispelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.295" offset="14435438">I think Justice Kagan got it exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.413" offset="14443901">But remember, another way to make it clear is that if Mr. Salinas had said in response to the question, I'd like for you to stop asking me questions, the police wouldn't have had to honor that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.554" offset="14488518">Somebody not in custody doesn't have a right to have questioning cut off, so the police could have kept asking him questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.708" offset="14509103">That's the only right that a custodial suspect has and needs to expressly invoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.243" offset="14527284">The right to remain silent is not something that's ever had to be expressly invoked by somebody in custody or not in custody, and there's no good reason to require it to be invoked here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.634" offset="14568767">If the Court has any further questions, I'd be happy to entertain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.753" offset="14585276">Otherwise, I'll submit the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3620.886" offset="14589874">I'll like to go back to what Justice Ginsburg argued, because there is an argument here that there wasn't an invocation of the right, that by physical conduct, there was a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.945" offset="14650060">Would you have had a problem if the prosecutor had argued at trial, you know, when he was asked about this testing, he didn't remain silent, he got nervous.</text>
