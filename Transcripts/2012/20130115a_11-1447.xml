            <text syncTime="256.282" offset="1130666">From the record it's very clear that a conservation offer is not considered mitigation because there's still a net loss of wetlands.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.895" offset="1421148">It is undisputed, the trial court found below and the Court of Appeals affirmed and the finding was undisturbed in the Florida Supreme Court, that in fact the offsite mitigation, that part of the mitigation that went beyond the conservation easement, was in excess; it violated Nollan and Dolan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.104" offset="5873980">So, the district later on, even in the Florida Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg, said in its petitioner's brief on jurisdiction at page 1 that it required additional mitigation before it would authorize the permits and that quote:</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.074" offset="12041908">It is standard procedure when someone applies for a permit from the government, it is the permit applicant's burden to establish that he complies with the regulatory program.</text>

            <text syncTime="3035.458" offset="12247440">And its only basis for saying, you can't do it was, because you wouldn't give us the easement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3041.362" offset="12271054">The basis of the -- the theory of Nollan and Dolan, and the Court made this clear in Lingle and in Delmonte Dunes, for that matter, is those two cases apply in a specific situation where there is an exaction of a right of access, an easement for the public to enter the land as a condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.359" offset="12363005">And the reason for that, the Court explained in Lingle, there are really two reinforcing points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.846" offset="12384948">The first was that there would be public access, which is a permanent physical occupation, which is one of the exceptions to the general Penn Central test for regulatory takings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.820" offset="12424863">The other is that it was a per se taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.539" offset="12439701">It was per se that the government could not have acquired that easement for paying -- without paying compensation; therefore, the government could not attach as a condition to the granting of a permit that the person convey something unless it was proportional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.199" offset="12502395">So the theory began with the idea that the easement itself would have been -- the taking of that would have been a per se taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.988" offset="12533533">This is a very different situation because the other way in which Petitioner's theory would constitute a radical departure is that compliance with regulatory programs frequently, maybe almost always, requires the expenditure of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.647" offset="12588181">If someone wants to build a power plant, a coal-fired power plant, he's going to have to install a scrubber to protect the air, to prevent no diminution of air quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.936" offset="12629350">Constructing that costs money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.705" offset="12636351">It can't be that the requirement to spend money to comply with a regulatory program is itself a taking.</text>
