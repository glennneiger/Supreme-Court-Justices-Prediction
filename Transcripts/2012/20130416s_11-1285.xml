            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Kagan has our opinion this morning in case 11-1285, U.S. Airways versus McCutchen.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="8.281" stopTime="277.032">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="8.281" offset="138595">James McCutchen received health benefits through a plan established by his employer, US Airways.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.019" offset="165449">When McCutchen was injured in a car accident caused by a negligent driver, US Airways paid his medical bills as the plan provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.217" offset="202334">Sometime later, McCutchen sued the other driver and secured a modest recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.102" offset="225844">US Airways demanded reimbursement from that recovery in accordance with the terms of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.585" offset="251758">McCutchen refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.953" offset="257191">So, US Airways filed suit asking for a lien on the funds he had obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.240" offset="282373">US Airways relied on section 502(a)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act called ERISA, which allows health-plan administrators to seek what's called appropriate equitable relief to enforce their plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.403" offset="351023">The question here is whether McCutchen can raise either of two equitable defenses to US Airways suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.743" offset="380385">One, would limit US Airways' claim to the amount McCutchen received for medical expenses and let him keep all the money he got for his pain and suffering or other kinds of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.591" offset="427823">The other, which is called the Common Fund Doctrine, would require U.S. Airways at least to pay a fair share of the attorney's fees that McCutchen expended to obtain his recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.404" offset="475052">McCutchen contends that those defenses apply, irrespective of whether US Airways plan, which is a kind of contract provides otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.584" offset="515803">The Third Circuit agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.606" offset="523849">Today, we vacate that decision in an opinion that has two parts - One, favoring US Airways and the other, McCutchen.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.168" offset="558122">We have held in the past that a health plan administrator can sue to enforce a reimbursement clause in its plan under ERISA's section 502(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="123.917" offset="601067">We reasoned then that such a suit sought equitable relief as the statute requires, because it demands something called an equitable lien by agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.970" offset="645266">That's a -- that's a fancy name for a fairly simple idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.841" offset="664806">The beneficiary has made a contract to reimburse the health plan administrator and equity, therefore, imposes a lien on the money he agreed to turn over.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.501" offset="707438">We think it follows that in a suit like this one, the plain terms of the contract controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.097" offset="729799">McCutchen's equitable defenses cannot override them.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.860" offset="744845">As I'd just said, the equitable lien by agreement that US Airways seeks to enforce is a creature of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.636" offset="772012">It arises from the party's agreement and serves to carry it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.867" offset="788940">Enforcing that kind of contract based lien, means holding the parties to their mutual promises and conversely, it means declining to apply principles that are at odds with the parties expressed commitments.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.185" offset="842125">So, US Airways is right that the contract governs.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.416" offset="859052">But McCutchen's arguments are not all for nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.955" offset="873263">Even if equitable principles of the kind he raises cannot trump a contract, they may aid in properly construing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.480" offset="903356">ERISA plans like other contracts don't always speak clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.629" offset="919970">Sometimes they leave gaps, and when that happens, courts routinely consider background legal principles to fill in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.572" offset="955705">Here, US Airways plan is silent on how to allocate attorney's fees, and in that circumstance, the Common Fund Doctrine provides the appropriate default rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.388" offset="998964">We discussed in the opinion why that is so, how well established the rule is and how strong the basis for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.748" offset="1028430">Without any sharing of attorney's fees, a health plan administrator would free ride on a beneficiary's efforts getting all its money back while contributing nothing to the costs of obtaining the recovery, and possibly, as in this case, leaving the beneficiary worse off than if he had not sought the recovery in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.271" offset="1110455">We do not think that a contracting party would expect or intend a plan that does not address attorney's fees to negate the equitable principle preventing this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.665" offset="1156117">And we, therefore, read US Airways plan to incorporate the common fund doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.758" offset="1180463">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices Thomas and Alito joined.</text>
