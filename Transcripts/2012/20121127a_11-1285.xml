            <text syncTime="11.205" offset="150840">ERISA permits plan fiduciaries to seek appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.009" offset="178111">Six years ago, this Court, in Sereboff, concluded that reimbursement actions by ERISA plans, such as the one at issue here, seek equitable liens by agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.083" offset="218445">And because the plan's claim here is one for an equitable lien by agreement, that means one person with equitable defenses, those derived from unjustment enrichment, offer no help to Respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="66.423" offset="371731">Quite to the contrary, Justice Sotomayor, our position is that the rules of equity bind equitable liens by agreement just as they bind anything else.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="77.230" offset="414990">So why does your lien have priority to the attorney's lien that is normally created at the commencement of the litigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="87.103" offset="454487">Why is the attorney bound by the agreement you signed with the beneficiary?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Neal Kumar Katyal</label>
            <text syncTime="94.526" offset="484162">--So, our position is that the attorney doesn't -- there is no lien created with the attorney; that once Mr. Sereboff signed -- entered into an agreement with US Air, that agreement said -- provided for 100 percent reimbursement rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.035" offset="546229">And there is no -- essentially, what happened is Mr. Sereboff -- Mr. -- Mr. McCutchen double-promised his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.641" offset="576636">He promised it first to -- first to the US Airways plan, and then he promised it to -- to his attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.811" offset="609341">And that's a problem that he might have with his attorneys, although, as I understand the facts here, maybe that debt has been forgiven, but it is not something that creates an independent lien on the money that's at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.638" offset="664616">That is, the rules in equity say that it is the agreement that controls -- when we're talking about an un -- when we're talking about an equitable lien by agreement--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="149.910" offset="705680">With Sereboff, that you -- you referred to, that -- that certainly describes the lien you rely on, but there's a footnote toward the end that leaves open the make-whole doctrine and, I assume, also the common fund doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.942" offset="789795">So -- so it's -- it's an open question.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.378" offset="803587">So our position is not that Sereboff's letter controls this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.530" offset="820201">We do think the reasoning of Sereboff essentially does decide the question, because what Sereboff said, Justice Ginsburg -- and this is at page 368 of the opinion in the text -- it said -- the Sereboffs had argued the make-whole doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.187" offset="874849">And the -- in response, what this Court said is, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="197.824" offset="897315">"Mid Atlantic's claim is not considered equitable because it is a subrogation claim. "</text>
            <text syncTime="202.561" offset="916332">"Mid Atlantic's action qualifies as an equitable remedy because it is indistinguishable from an action to enforce an equitable lien established by agreement of the sort epitomized by our decision in Barnes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="213.953" offset="961889">Mid Atlantic need not characterize this action as a freestanding action for equitable subrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.838" offset="981429">Accordingly, the parcel of equitable defenses the Sereboffs claim accompany any such action are beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.011" offset="1014134">“ Beside the point ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.261" offset="1019150">And our position is once the Court has decided that the type of action that is at issue here is an equitable lien by agreement, the relevant doctrine -- and this is further answer to you, Justice Sotomayor -- that the Court is to look to is how are equitable liens by agreement evaluated in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.072" offset="1090307">And those rules in equity say that, again, the general rules of equity apply in government; but, the one place, the one set of defenses that aren't governed, are those that sound an unjust enrichment.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.517" offset="1152165">What about the law of most of the States?</text>
            <text syncTime="264.219" offset="1162928">Suppose there's an agreement with an insurer and an insured that says the insured gets 100 percent of the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.140" offset="1194588">I would think that the law of most States gives a superior lien to the attorney for the contingent fee, notwithstanding the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.180" offset="1234817">I'm not sure of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.447" offset="1239832">It's just an assumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.036" offset="1278180">But if you simply have an agreement by an insured and it provides for 100 percent reimbursement and abrogation of the common fund, even there, Justice Kennedy, the agreement is enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.629" offset="1328544">So State Farm v. Clinton, which is a case cited in our brief, as long as -- as well as the Dobbs case and other decisions -- the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1969, the Arkansas court in 1931 -- have all said that if you have an insurance agreement that abrogates the common fund doctrine, that that agreement is enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.499" offset="3708090">It's the idea that, look, we're not obligated to give you this money because we're not at fault in this accident, but we're going to essentially advance it to you, but you've got to reimburse us for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="969.043" offset="3982271">And the -- the beneficiaries in Sereboff were saying, hey, this is subrogation, this is subrogation.</text>

            <text syncTime="990.306" offset="4067326">And so all you have to do here is precisely what this Court unanimously did in Sereboff, which is to say, look at the nature of the action, is this an action that seeks personal liability, does it specify a particular fund, the typical hallmarks of an action for an equitable lien by agreement; and, if those are present, as they are here, that is enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.556" offset="5948247">I take it, the common fund doctrine says, if this victim here got some money back from the person who caused the accident, that that money goes into a common fund in the sense that those who share in the fund must share as well in the cost of producing the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.934" offset="6021808">So if it costs $50,000 to produce $100,000, which is in the fund, that we have to have US Air as well pay part of the cost of producing the fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.725" offset="6076978">But I hear the argument, fair though it is, we have here an agreement, and in this agreement it says, it's as if it said, and you shall not apply the common fund doctrine or any other equitable doctrine such as he who seeks equity must do equity, etc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.322" offset="6155346">And I think that's the question that's being asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.524" offset="6168198">And so what is your response to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.976" offset="6178020">In particular, why do you say the common fund doctrine applies, though the contract says it doesn't, we assume, but all these other equitable doctrines don't apply?</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.547" offset="6508208">Its roots are actually in an analogy to trust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.349" offset="6519493">If you look back to the principal case that established this, the Greenough case that we talk about in our brief, the Court said that Mr. Vose, who -- the bondholder who had secured a benefit for all the bondholders, had, while not a trustee, had acted the part of a trustee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.089" offset="8630396">And it's perfectly consistent with our position, because we believe that the principles in equity that governed exactly the kinds of claims that were at issue in Sereboff and are at issue here, reimbursement claims based on an express agreement, are in fact governed by the same principles of unjust enrichment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.716" offset="12308959">Now, there is another reason in this case -- or in these ERISA cases -- why these agreements need to be in the plan, and that's because section 502(a)(3) itself does not allow for a plan, like Petitioner, to obtain a general right to equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.578" offset="12372384">All that the Petitioner can -- can seek here is equitable -- appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of its plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.482" offset="12404045">And so in the absence of an expressed provision, like a subrogation clause, it would not be entitled to pursue a -- a general right to subrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.207" offset="12442915">It's a term -- that back-end reference is a -- is a term of limitation that limits the types of claims that petitioner can bring in these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3440.021" offset="13866170">The first is that both equity law and ERISA law point in the same direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.473" offset="13888009">Justice Scalia is absolutely right, that they have zero cases that say if there's a preexisting agreement that settles the common fund doctrine, that makes it not enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.863" offset="13929491">And Justice Ginsburg's absolutely right to say that when the plan -- the plan is not unjustly enriched to get the money that they are entitled to get under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.236" offset="13970974">The second point I would make is that the Solicitor General says, well, this is now--</text>

            <text syncTime="3481.931" offset="14033772">But I still am having trouble with understanding how you can bind a third party like a lawyer, who's done the effort to recover that fund -- more along Justice Breyer's question, which is, not only in -- in all equity, lawyers are entitled, whether by contract or by unjust enrichment principles, to a -- to a percentage of their expenses in recovering something.</text>

            <text syncTime="3511.617" offset="14152577">Justice Sotomayor, that's precisely what cases like State Farm and the Arkansas case from 1969, the Maryland case from 1931 address, which is that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.556" offset="14192283">And the reason is that essentially here, it's a mistake to see this as a third-party case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.293" offset="14211196">This is really a situation created by Mr. McCutchen double-promising the same money to two entities, US Air and to his lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.232" offset="14251006">And so it's essentially a dispute really among two parties, not three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.034" offset="14266157">Now, the Solicitor General says, well, this is rooted in equitable doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.354" offset="14283502">There is no case that they have that says that there's some equitable doctrine that trumps the preexisting agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.492" offset="14312028">And, indeed, the case that they cite, the Greenough case, is one that essentially relies on unjust enrichment principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.864" offset="14345569">Sure, the Court has an equity power when to remedy unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.018" offset="14366154">That is an inherent power of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3568.454" offset="14379842">What we are saying is that when you have an agreement in advance, that means, per se, there is no unjust enrichment, that they are to use this Court's language in the Sereboff defense that it is beside the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3623.873" offset="14601569">They are saying that it is inequitable to have the Federal Blue Cross Blue Shield plan, which governs 4.6 million people, including perhaps members of this Court, which has the exact same provisions as the US Air plan: An abrogation of common fund and a 100 percent reimbursement provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.085" offset="14674399">And they are saying that that would not be enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.037" offset="14686206">That may create any number of problems for the government, I imagine, when it tries to enforce that.</text>
