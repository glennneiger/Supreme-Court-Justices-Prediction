            <text syncTime="10.456" offset="148254">The court below thrice refused to enforce the parties' arbitration agreement, because he thought that class procedures were necessary to vindicate the plaintiff's Sherman Act claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.763" offset="193498">That holding was reversible error for at least three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.148" offset="210948">First, it has no basis in either the FAA or the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.785" offset="229547">Second, it creates an unworkable threshold inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="42.677" offset="277090">Mr. Kellogg, suppose it goes to arbitration as you think it should, and the arbitrator says to the merchant, to prove your case, you have to show the relevant market, you have to show that American Express has market power, that it used that power to the detriment of its competitors, and the way these sections -- the way these kinds of cases have gone is to get an expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.398" offset="404045">And I don't see that you can prove it in -- in a new way.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.254" offset="439467">I mean, the whole point of this is that the expense to win one of these cases is enormous.</text>

            <text syncTime="103.166" offset="519088">The first is, that it is up to the arbitrator in the first instance to devise procedures to deal with claims in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.256" offset="555451">Second, to the extent that an expert report is required that would cost a lot of money, we have conceded below that the parties could share costs of that expert just as they could share the costs of a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.383" offset="623891">And third, the alternative is to have an inquiry upfront, that this Court has rejected in Concepcion, that you cannot condition the enforcement of an arbitration agreement on the availability of class procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.963" offset="942272">To make that determination, he first has to do a Rule 23 analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.250" offset="959408">Would there even be a class certified in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="217.052" offset="974664">Only 20 percent of putative classes are certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.520" offset="992531">And that's not an inquiry that the Court should be making at the outset.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.758" offset="1017400">The -- the arbitrator has now said we have to have an expert, and the plaintiff says -- or the complainant says, I haven't got the wherewithal, and if I have six friends who bring individual arbitrations, that's not nearly enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.487" offset="1096394">So what happens then, the case ends, and it's not possible--</text>

            <text syncTime="253.391" offset="1120009">As we said, they would be able to share an expert between multiple plaintiffs, but there is no guarantee in the law that every claim has a procedural path to its effective vindication.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.383" offset="1167970">This Court held in Eisen, for example, even though the Court acknowledged that it was a $70 claim, it could only be brought as a class action, but the plaintiff in that case said, I can't afford to do the notice costs, and the Court said well, then, the class is decertified, because the plaintiff has to put up the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.112" offset="1246860">The whole point of arbitration of course is that it expands the universe of claims that can be brought efficiently and effectively for small consumers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.563" offset="6084633">Ever since this Court 30 years ago, roughly, got in the business of extending arbitration to Federal statutory claims, it's used the effective vindication doctrine as an assurance that Federal statutory claims would not go unvindicated just because of the arbitral forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.175" offset="6151088">And so, if you look at this Court's cases, they stand for a simple proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.998" offset="6402386">But there were procedures in like joinder that allowed for multiple claims to be litigated together; there were not confidentiality agreements that came in and limited your ability to share information from one claim to another, and, of course, back in the good old days, you didn't necessarily need a $300,000 expert to bring a Sherman Act claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.396" offset="6475947">But what I think is the problem is when you have a difference, and that is the assumption on which this case comes to the Court, where you could vindicate this claim in court, because there are mechanisms to share or shift costs and you cannot vindicate them in the arbitration because of a combination of features of the arbitration agreement that prevent any sharing or shifting of costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2698.443" offset="10900149">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.495" offset="10908404">At the beginning of the argument, Justice Kagan asked whether a pure exculpatory clause, a provision in a contract that simply said, we promise not to seek relief under the arbitration -- under the antitrust clause period would be enforceable, and Mr. Kellogg replied that it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.738" offset="10965351">And I think the unenforceability of such a provision would not depend on any analysis of what was likely to happen if the suit was brought in court; that is, a pure exculpatory clause could be set aside and the plaintiff could still lose for any number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.848" offset="11025746">The plaintiff could be denied class certification and decide it's uneconomical to proceed with an individual suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.568" offset="11048629">He could lose on a threshold ground like the statute of limitations or he could lose on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.304" offset="11067647">But the unenforceability of the pure exculpatory clause wouldn't require the Court to make a comparison between being kicked out of court on that basis and what would likely happen if the suit were able to be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.279" offset="11119474">And we would submit that the same mode of analysis applies when the arbitration agreement can be shown to have the same practical effect as an exculpatory clause; that is, if it is the case that given the amount of money at stake, the arbitration procedure specified in the contract and the modes of proof that would be necessary in arbitration, if it can be shown persuasively by the plaintiff who bears the burden that no reasonable plaintiff would find it economically feasible to proceed, then the arbitration agreement can't be enforced--</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.206" offset="11699183">That is, our -- our position is in determining whether the arbitration agreement has the same practical effect as an exculpatory clause, we asked could any reasonable plaintiff proceed under the terms and conditions that are set up?</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.297" offset="11755607">And if the answer to that is no, then the arbitration agreement is unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.185" offset="11771176">Now, I would make two real-world points, one of which Mr. Clement has already alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.320" offset="11787686">The first is the only cases that are going to wind up in court are those in which the plaintiff at least believes that it would be feasible to vindicate the claim in court, and so they are likely to be those in which there is a potential difference between the outcome in court and the outcome in arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.579" offset="11848708">The other is, even if a plaintiff believes wrongly that he can proceed in court through a class action mechanism and class action -- class certification is denied under Rule 23, presumably at that point the plaintiff is going to give up and the outcome at the end of the day is going to be the same as if the arbitration agreement had been enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.726" offset="11925299">This is exactly -- I found no authority for the proposition that what hinders -- plenty of authority, you can't make the person go to arbitration if the fees involved are too high, because he's blocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.134" offset="11978902">But you're quite an advance over that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.336" offset="11991754">You are saying the thing that keeps him out is his own theory of wrong, which will involve hiring a lot of experts and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.508" offset="12020489">Now, once that's adopted, it seems to me in practice we have reversed in many, many cases the proposition that you can in fact require Federal causes of action to be arbitrated, because all you have to do to get out of the arbitration is to allege a theory of your case which is hard and complicated to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.893" offset="12121949">Now you are back in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.443" offset="12128218">Now that's a significant erosion, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.528" offset="12140548">So I want to know if you have any standard there, if we're just supposed to accept that, if in fact you are trying to reverse in practice what was the holding that you can arbitrate these Federal causes of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3051.374" offset="12311911">--Let me start with your last question and work backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.826" offset="12325704">It is possible and it sometimes has happened in the lower court cases that a plaintiff will come into court and say: I can't proceed through arbitration because the arbitral fees are too high in relation to my likely recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.586" offset="12384740">And the defendant at that point will say, we offer to waive the fees or we offer to pay your share of the arbitral fees, and a court will be persuaded that, given that consensual modification of the contract, it is feasible for the claims to be brought in arbitration and the plaintiff is kicked out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.713" offset="12457256">Now, this is consensual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.230" offset="12463317">This is something that the court has -- that the court has done at the company's behest, and it would be different question of whether the court could do that over the company's objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.019" offset="12498530">But another thing that the company could do is put in a severability clause in the contract that would specify what results should obtain if one provision of the contract were held to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.227" offset="12543356">I guess another thing I would say in response to your question is we do have one data point, the First Circuit's decision in Kristian, which I believe Mr. Clement referred to, in 2006, which essentially held on facts similar to these that the arbitration clause as written was not enforceable because the cost of the expert fees in an antitrust case would dwarf any potential recovery, and we haven't seen the floodgates opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.776" offset="12641472">The last thing I would say is if this is the concern, Petitioner's proposed rule really doesn't match the argument in its favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.067" offset="12678670">That is, Petitioner is not just arguing for a rule that would cover cases in which the relevant costs are those of experts or similar authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.172" offset="12715137">Petitioner's rule would say even if the contract provides for a non-recoupable $500 filing fee and the amount of the claim at stake is $200, so it's absolutely apparent on the face of the contract that the claim can't be brought, the agreement is still enforceable and the plaintiff is deprived of his day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.234" offset="12795385">The other thing I would say about Petitioner's argument is the challenge to the Second Circuit's decision has really changed drastically since the cert petition was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.173" offset="12831121">That, is the Second Circuit took it as essentially undisputed that the costs of the expert report would render it economically infeasible to proceed in arbitration, and it took the further step of saying, therefore the arbitration agreement is unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.968" offset="12898308">Now, the cert petition challenged only the “ therefore ” part of the Second Circuit's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.505" offset="12916385">There wasn't a suggestion that the Petitioner intended to challenge the antecedent determination that these claims couldn't feasibly have been brought in individualized proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.061" offset="12958598">And I think as Paul -- Mr. Clement said, the likely reason is that wouldn't look like a cert-worthy issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.465" offset="12980228">That sort of fact-specific inquiry wouldn't seem like a wise use of this Court's resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.336" offset="12999767">So having gotten cert granted on the important legal question whether the inefficacy of arbitration procedures is a basis for invalidating the agreement, Petitioners are now spending a great deal of time arguing that it would in fact have been feasible to pursue these claims through individualized arbitration.</text>
