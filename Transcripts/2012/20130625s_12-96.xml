            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">I have the opinion of the Court this morning in case 12-96, Shelby County versus Holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.163" offset="136150">Voting discrimination against African-Americans was so entrenched and pervasive in 1965 that to cite just one example, less than 7% of African-Americans of voting age in Mississippi had been able to register to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.422" offset="201143">In contrast, 70% of white citizens of voting age were registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.438" offset="221205">A gap of 63 percentage points.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.022" offset="235520">Prodded to action by the civil rights movement, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965 to confront that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.328" offset="268748">The Act prohibited racial discrimination in voting and banned literacy tests and the like that were being used to prevent African-Americans from voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.196" offset="308245">Those provisions are not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.496" offset="321411">Congress then went on to adopt other measures to address the extraordinary of the problem it faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.826" offset="346802">First, it required states to submit and proposed voting change to the United States Attorney General or a three-judge court in Washington, D.C. before such a change could take effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.112" offset="399882">This was a significant departure from basic principles of our federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.933" offset="419213">Second, the Act made this requirement applicable only to some states, a similar departure from the principle that states enjoy equal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.135" offset="459964">The preclearance requirement applied only those states that had a voting test in 1964 and had less than 50% voter registration or turnout in the 1964 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.571" offset="509701">Congress recognized that a voting test was used as a means to keep African-Americans from registering or voting and that the resulting discrimination would show up in low voting numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.637" offset="557976">The formula meant that six states in the South were covered, reflecting the unprecedented nature of this selective preclearance regime, the provisions were temporary, set to expire after five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.527" offset="613564">The Act was challenged but this Court upheld it saying and I quote, “Exceptional conditions can justify legislative measures not otherwise appropriate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="137.374" offset="656927">The Act was extended in 1970 for an additional five years, in 1975 for an additional seven, in 1982 for an additional 25, and in 2006 for an additional 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.316" offset="716696">The last time the coverage formula was updated however, the formula for deciding which jurisdictions had to submit voting changes was with the 1975 extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.257" offset="764447">That means that jurisdictions are covered today based on whether they had a voting test and low voter registration or turnout in 1964, 1968, or 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.150" offset="816065">The Act has been a resounding success.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.869" offset="830903">You will recall the 7% registration figure for African-Americans in Mississippi in 1965, it was 76% in 2004.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.289" offset="876669">As for the gap of 63 percentage points between African-American and white voter registration in that state in 1965, there was a gap in 2004 of about 4%, but it was in favor of African-American registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.974" offset="947409">There are examples of progress, more poignant than the numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.788" offset="966635">During the freedom summer of 1964 in Philadelphia, Mississippi, three men were murdered while working in the area to register African-American voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.665" offset="1006132">On bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama in 1965, police beat and used tear gas on hundreds marching in support of enfranchising African-Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.778" offset="1050540">Today, both Philadelphia and Mississippi and Selma, Alabama have African-Americans mayors.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.885" offset="1078962">No one doubts that there is still voting discrimination in the South and in the rest of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.941" offset="1103203">As noted when we upheld the original Act, we said that exception conditions can justify legislative measures not otherwise appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.035" offset="1143641">The question is whether the extraordinary measures of preclearance and desperate treatment of the states that were upheld 45 years ago remained constitutional in light of today's changed conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.605" offset="1197871">Now that question was before us four years ago in case called Northwest Austin.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.124" offset="1219918">In our decision, we stated that the preclearance and selective coverage features of the Act “raised serious constitutional questions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="288.366" offset="1260983">But we did not decide those questions at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.457" offset="1273313">Instead, we applied a doctrine known as constitutional avoidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.240" offset="1292434">Under that doctrine, courts should look carefully to see if there is some way to decide a case without getting into sensitive constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.510" offset="1329528">We determined that it was reasonably possible to decide the case on statutory grounds and we did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.498" offset="1357427">But we made our concerns about the continued constitutionality of the preclearance provision and coverage formula very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.600" offset="1389819">Those concerns were expressed in an opinion joined by eight members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.486" offset="1413433">Congress took no action in response.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.119" offset="1423987">Today, we cannot avoid reaching the constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.781" offset="1442586">The arguments that the preclearance requirement in Section 5 of the Act can no longer be justified have a great deal of force, but we do not strike down that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.164" offset="1484173">We do however find that the coverage formula in Section 4 violates the constitution and cannot be used to decide which jurisdictions are subject to preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.845" offset="1526805">That formula looks to conditions as they were in 1972 and earlier, more than 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.098" offset="1555853">A jurisdiction is subject to preclearance today if it employed a voting test at that time or had done so since 1964 and if voter registration or turnout in the state had been low in elections in the 1960s and early 1970s.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.219" offset="1624294">But the Act imposes current burdens and must be based on current political conditions as we warned four years ago in Northwest Austin.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.299" offset="1664627">If Congress had started from scratch when it extended the challenge provisions in 2006, it plainly could not have enacted the present coverage formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.942" offset="1699213">It would have been irrational for Congress to distinguish between states in such a fundamental way based on 40-year old data when today's statistics tell an entirely different story.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.465" offset="1745293">And it would have been irrational to base coverage on the use of voting test 40 years ago when such test had been illegal since that time, but that is exactly what Congress has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.924" offset="1791164">The government points to the extensive record Congress compiled when it extended the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.817" offset="1810704">The parties debate about how that record should be analyzed, but that's not the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.416" offset="1829094">Congress did not use that record as the basis for a coverage formula reflecting current conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.215" offset="1852291">It instead extended a formula based on whether a jurisdiction had a voting test 40 years earlier and based on plainly obsolete statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.983" offset="1891370">Any racial discrimination in voting is too much, but our country has changed in the past 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.045" offset="1919687">In the last election, the percentage of African-Americans turning out to vote exceeded white voter turnout in five of the six states original subject to the preclearance requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.947" offset="1963259">The gap in the six state was less than one half of 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.153" offset="1980082">When taking such extraordinary steps as subjecting state legislation to preclearance in Washington and applying that regime only to some disfavored states, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes speaks to current conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.190" offset="2040268">The coverage formula, unchanged for 40 years plainly does not do so and therefore we have no choice but to find that it violates the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.240" offset="2080392">Justice Thomas has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.246" offset="2092408">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan have joined.</text>
