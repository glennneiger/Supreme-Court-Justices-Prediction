            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Kagan has the opinion of the Court in number 11-820, Chaidez versus United States.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="6.685" offset="133141">Three years ago in the case called Padilla v. Kentucky, this Court held that the Sixth Amendment requires criminal defense attorneys to warn their clients whenever pleading guilty to a crime could cause them to be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.051" offset="190610">The question in this case is whether that decision applies retroactively so that the defendants whose convictions became final prior to Padilla can benefit from its rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.224" offset="239303">The petitioner here, Roselva Chaidez, pleaded guilty to two crimes that unbeknownst to her made her deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.700" offset="269291">Her convictions became final in 200.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.656" offset="285069">After the government initiated deportation proceedings, she filed this suite, she can collateral relief to overturn her convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.170" offset="319133">She argued that her attorney's failure to inform her that pleading guilty could lead to deportation constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, and violation of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.703" offset="369288">While her suit was pending, we held in Padilla that her view of the Sixth Amendment was right, but the court below, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that Chaidez could not benefit from Padilla because her conviction became final before we decided that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.176" offset="451103">The tests we used to determine whether one of our criminal procedure decisions applies retroactively comes from a case called Teague v. Lane.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.808" offset="489660">In Teague, we held that any decision announcing a new rule would not apply to people like Chaidez whose conviction had already become final.And we explained that a case announces a new rule whenever its result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.237" offset="579417">But in another way, a decision is new if its result would not already have been apparent to all reasonable judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.713" offset="609301">If Padilla announced a new rule according to this test, Chaidez cannot benefit from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.278" offset="635528">At the same time, we have said that a case does not announce a new rule when it merely applies a general standard from a prior decision to a new set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.494" offset="676383">One such standard is the test we established in Strickland v. Washington for assessing when a lawyer has given a criminal defendant incompetent advice in violation of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.043" offset="726643">Garnering variety applications of Strickland do not produce new rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.210" offset="747332">So, if our decision in Padilla had merely applied Strickland had merely said that a lawyer who fails to inform his client about deportation is professionally incompetent, then we would not have announced a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.839" offset="805846">But we hold today the Padilla did something more.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.503" offset="820475">Before the Padilla Court could apply Strickland, it had to decide as a threshold matter whether Strickland had any relevance to the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.064" offset="858718">And in doing that, the Court announced a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.930" offset="874183">Before Padilla, courts across the country held that the Strickland test was utterly irrelevant when a lawyer provided or failed to provide advice about deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.592" offset="916814">That's because deportation was viewed as a collateral consequence of a conviction, something outside the scope of the criminal proceeding itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.575" offset="952759">On this view, a lawyer could act completely incompetently with respect to giving advice about deportation and a way that clearly would have flunked the Strickland test and still it would not count as a violation of the Sixth Amendment because it was about an immigration matter, which was separate from the criminal from the criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.033" offset="1030604">Before Padilla came along, nearly 40 state and lower federal courts had adapted that view.Only two had held to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.113" offset="1066862">What Padilla did that was new and it was very new was to say that this understanding of the Sixth Amendment scope was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.587" offset="1100821">Padilla held that the Sixth Amendment applied to a lawyer giving a criminal defendant advice about deportation, even though deportation was a matter of separate from the criminal preceding.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.408" offset="1144080">In other words, Padilla held for the first time that advice about deportation consequences had to satisfy the Sixth Amendment and so had to pass the Strickland test.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.608" offset="1188906">Only after we decided that could we proceed to apply Strickland in a usual way.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.682" offset="1213147">And that preliminary holding was not apparent to all reasonable judges before we decided Padilla.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.095" offset="1238852">Indeed, as I have just indicated, it was hardly apparent to any of them and our decision changed the prevailing law in almost every jurisdiction in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.682" offset="1285141">We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.444" offset="1300187">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.652" offset="1317010">Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg joins.</text>
