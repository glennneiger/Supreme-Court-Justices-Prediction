            <text syncTime="7.887" offset="137969">Thank you,--</text>
            <text syncTime="8.470" offset="140373">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.922" offset="150195">In Michigan v. Summers, this Court established a categorical exception to the default Fourth Amendment requirement of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.509" offset="180497">Under Summers, officers executing a search warrant for contraband may detain individuals they encounter at the scene while they are in the course of executing the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.734" offset="225427">This case presents the question whether the Summers exception also permits officers to detain individuals who have left the scene before the warrant is executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.239" offset="263462">Because individuals who have left the scene do not pose an immediate threat to the safe and efficient completion of the search, the court of appeals erred by permitting their detention absent probable cause or even individualized suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.880" offset="321976">Its judgment should therefore be reversed.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="56.265" offset="331485">Counsel, the two tests, yours seem to be the immediate vicinity test, and the Second Circuit is as soon as practical test.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.739" offset="377460">Your adversaries point out that the Second Circuit test actually focuses on the police officer's conduct, which should be the focus of reasonableness or unreasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.047" offset="426675">Your test just creates an artificial line that is subject to as much play as the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.470" offset="460320">Why isn't the focus on police conduct the right focus?</text>

            <text syncTime="92.790" offset="477666">Well, let me explain, Justice Sotomayor, first, the sort of theoretical basis for why we're offering this line, and, second, say a word about the comparative merits of the two tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.395" offset="520089">First of all, with regard to the theoretical basis for the line, our fundamental submission to this Court is that Summers does not create a police entitlement; it is instead a rule of necessity and should be confined to situations in which a detention serves search-related purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.357" offset="591873">And in our view, the justifications for a detention evaporate once an individual has left the immediate vicinity of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.730" offset="625414">And, again, that's because in those circumstances a detention serves no interest in ensuring the safe and efficient completion of the search because the individual poses no immediate threat to the safe and efficient completion of the search.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.172" offset="887161">You say the difference is there's no immediate threat to the officers here.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.076" offset="906805">But there is a threat, I suppose, I mean, if he finds out about the search and comes back, if he sees the officers outside his dwelling, if there's somebody in the dwelling who can notify him, send him a message that the police are searching and he can get his confederates and come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.121" offset="982978">It seems to me that you're requiring that there be a larger number of police present at the site conducting the search, being lookouts for anybody that might come back, being able to detain people who are leaving as they approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.630" offset="1040970">There's no immediate threat, but there's certainly a threat.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.649" offset="1053091">If anything, it's the government's approach that requires a greater number of officers at the site because, under the government's approach, you have the two officers who conduct the detention while a separate group of officers execute the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.826" offset="1101783">And it's really for that reason, Justice Scalia--</text>

            <text syncTime="254.461" offset="1124353">--Well, let me say something about this prospect that the individual will return.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.182" offset="1143161">We think that the appropriate analysis here is the analysis that this Court set out in Arizona v. Gant.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.685" offset="1169179">And this Court, in Arizona v. Gant, suggested that where a categorical rule is involved, you have to look at the class of cases to which the rule would be extended to see if the justifications apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.726" offset="1213378">Now, with regard to this class of individuals who have left the scene, we believe that it is simply unlikely either that such an individual who has left the scene will be aware of the presence of police, or that such an individual will return in an effort to disrupt the search.</text>

          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="292.069" stopTime="299.092">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="292.069" offset="1274714">Well, what if he were aware, or what if there was reason to think he might be aware, would you then allow the police to do what the police did here?</text>

            <text syncTime="300.475" offset="1308360">And that's simply because we believe that this should be a categorical analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.078" offset="1326750">So, again, you're looking at this entire class of cases where individuals have left the scene to determine whether the justifications for the Summers rule apply.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kannon K. Shanmugam</label>
            <text syncTime="362.249" offset="1555478">And so, to provide a hypothetical that will hopefully put some meat on the bones of this issue, suppose that an individual leaves a house, and he actually sees police officers sitting in a car, whether marked or unmarked, outside the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.092" offset="1610858">And it is clear that he has seen the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.711" offset="1621307">He waves at the officers and then ambles down the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.913" offset="1634159">I don't think that there would be any doubt but that that individual could not be detained unless he did something more; unless, for instance, he engaged in flight at that point, at which point he could perhaps be detained under Terry.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.636" offset="1685045">And so we simply submit that the analysis should be no different in a situation in which the purpose -- the reason why the officers are sitting outside the house is because another group of officers is about to execute the search warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.168" offset="1779086">So -- so you're arguing we shouldn't extend Summers, but that leaves this very case susceptible to the assertion that this was a legitimate Terry stop.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.213" offset="1851289">And just to be clear about how these two doctrines work together, our submission to this Court is that within the search zone, within the immediate vicinity of the premises, the rule of Summers applies, so that, if officers encounter an individual within that zone while they are in the process of executing the warrant, a detention is permissible absent probable cause or individualized suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.245" offset="1947419">Outside that search zone, ordinary Fourth Amendment principles apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.631" offset="1964974">And, of course, under the Fourth Amendment, detentions of persons have to be justified by some degree of individualized suspicion; probable cause for a full-fledged arrest, individualized suspicion for a more limited detention under Terry.</text>

            <text syncTime="493.133" offset="2078972">Now, they have the choice, if you prevail, of either rushing in and stopping the person within the curtilage, in which case they could detain the person, or they could allow the person to walk some distance outside of the site of the house and then stop the person, and that would allow them to execute the warrant without endanger -- without enhancing the danger to them from potentially armed people inside or allowing of the destruction of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.854" offset="2205927">What -- in that situation, what argues in favor of your rule, that if they want to detain this individual, they have to rush in and stop him before he leaves the premises?</text>

            <text syncTime="566.864" offset="2373947">And I think the fundamental problem with the court of appeals' rule and with the government's submission to this Court is that it really entails the conclusion that once officers see the individual leaving the house, they have an entitlement to detain that individual, with the only open question being where and how they go about effectuating the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.012" offset="2458479">But we simply believe that the justifications for the detention don't attach to the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.553" offset="2604660">And that is simply because the justification in preventing flight is different in kind from the other two justifications that we've been discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.707" offset="2633290">The other two justifications are truly special law enforcement interests, to use this Court's words in Summers.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.610" offset="2660876">The interest in preventing flight, by contrast, is an ordinary law enforcement interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.931" offset="2682191">And just as in my hypothetical, when the officers are sitting outside and they see an individual wander by, the mere fact that the individual saw the police and perhaps would therefore conclude that the police were on to him would not give rise to a basis for detention simply because that individual could subsequently flee.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.595" offset="2756797">So, too, we think that preventing flight in and of itself is insufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.098" offset="6686867">Now, I know police when they're executing warrants often have an advance team that has been surveilling a home, sometimes for days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.704" offset="6729290">And they've got one officer sitting there, and they see who they think is the occupant leave, and the team doesn't arrive till 12 hours later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.095" offset="6770877">Is it your position that in that circumstance the officers are authorized to go to wherever the defend -- wherever the occupant is, the office, the -- wherever he might be, his mother's home, and effect an arrest there?</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.925" offset="6854156">I appreciate the opportunity to start there because I think Petitioner's reply brief and much of his argument today is devoted to a position the government's not taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.579" offset="6880800">So let me be very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.795" offset="6885607">In the government's view, Summers is about current and recent occupants, people whom police, when they are executing the warrant, find at the home or see leaving the home in the process of executing a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.720" offset="6929388">And the question here is do the justifications apply equally as a departing occupant steps away from the home and onto a sidewalk, a yard, a couple blocks away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.008" offset="6966482">And I think my friend's answer to that has a wonderfully abstract quality to it that doesn't engage any of the realities on the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.562" offset="6992709">Justice Alito, your hypothetical is anything but.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.931" offset="7002218">It comes very close to the facts of the Cochran case out of the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.966" offset="7014338">Police arrive at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.585" offset="7020817">The occupant is known to carry a gun, and he has a guard dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.537" offset="7032624">So, rather than walk up to the door, they wait for him to leave; but, by the time they can catch up to him, he's off of the bounds of the property, but he's still very close to the residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.143" offset="7067001">They stop him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.276" offset="7071599">They take him back to the residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.012" offset="7078495">He lets the officers in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.145" offset="7083093">He secures the dog, and they complete the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.380" offset="7091974">I think that is a model law enforcement practice, and it is indistinguishable in any important respect from what went on in Summers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.283" offset="7119560">The justifications for detention apply equally to departing occupants when they are seen by officers leaving in the process of executing the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.472" offset="7152369">But no, Justice Sotomayor, the government is not contending that other connections to the residence, other than that kind of observed connection by the officers, could justify a detention under Summers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3274.180" offset="13203165">And there are really good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.763" offset="13209538">One, they tend to flee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.048" offset="13218629">And we see that in Cavazos out of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.600" offset="13228869">Two, they provide assistance in the search; and three, they are often violent or aggressive individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.636" offset="13249036">I don't think it's irrelevant that the vast majority of search warrants for contraband are for guns and drugs, and you see a number of amici States in here saying: Look, this is a legitimate and important law enforcement practice for officers in a very dangerous and volatile situation in executing these warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.580" offset="13308804">And I think Petitioner takes those risks way too lightly, and will not -- steadfastly refuses to engage the realities on the ground that we see in the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.567" offset="13340778">Judges and the Federal and State courts are grappling with this every day, and what these opinions reveal is that these risks cannot be so easily dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.757" offset="13369512">They are serious and they are real, and we see them play themselves out across this entire set of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.975" offset="13390410">And what we don't see noticeably is the kinds of things that the Court tends to be worried about in Fourth Amendment cases: Abuse and police entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.898" offset="13418100">Again and again, you see police detaining departing occupants a very short distance from a residence, returning them, not prolonging the detention, not engaging in exploitative questioning, and actually serving the three interests that the Court identified in Summers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.990" offset="13474420">And to be clear, Petitioner's solution is more than just a solution in search of a problem; it carries its own problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.328" offset="13503782">It is severely under-inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.763" offset="13513499">It will not capture any number of cases where there are valuable law enforcement interests to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.667" offset="13533143">And it will produce very silly results in a number of cases where police can't catch up to a departing occupant for one reason or another until after he's crossed some magical gate, and they will have to sit on their hands until he returns so that they can do exactly what they would have done minutes or hours earlier if they'd been able to detain him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3421.007" offset="13790502">Just -- just a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.459" offset="13796353">First of all, having suggested in its brief that the police may detain any individual with a connection to the place to be searched under Summers, the Government today falls back to the view that the police may detain any individual with an observed connection, suggesting that this Court can leave for another day the question of whether to detain people with a certain but non-observed connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.071" offset="13874720">Leaving that aside, the Government suggests on at least five occasions today that that observed connection is sufficient to give rise to reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.879" offset="13914009">That was not the basis on which this Court adopted its categorical rule in Summers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.681" offset="13933235">If it had been, the discussion of the special law enforcement interests supporting the rule would have been entirely superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.103" offset="13962910">And it's for that reason we would respectfully submit that the Court made clear in footnote 19 that Summers permits officers to detain individuals regardless of the quantum of proof justifying the detention of specific individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.327" offset="14015782">And this Court's subsequent cases applying Summers have made clear that Summers permits the detention of individuals with no apparent connection to the criminal activity being investigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.319" offset="14059772">And that leads into my second point, which is that Terry will serve as a fallback in many of these cases to permit detentions of individuals who are seen leaving the premises, where there is a sufficient additional basis to give rise to reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.644" offset="14121003">In fact, it may very well be the exception to the rule that you have a case in which there aren't sufficient additional articulable facts to give rise to reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.369" offset="14159978">We would respectfully submit that this case falls within that exceptional category, but it really underscores why the expansion of Summers that the Government is seeking is really unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.058" offset="14202714">I would just note, in response to a point that Justice Scalia made, that the fundamental flaw with the Government's position is that it really can't be reconciled with any original understanding of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.866" offset="14249943">There's no historical evidence suggesting that officers at the time of the founding or thereafter, when executing search warrants, detained the occupants of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.221" offset="14287351">And the problem with the Government's approach is that it really would convert any search warrant into a search and seizure warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.142" offset="14311070">It would really would suggest that there is a freestanding right to detain anyone with a connection or an observed connection to the place to be searched that operates alongside the warrant-conferred right to conduct the search.</text>

            <text syncTime="3612.282" offset="14555576">Perhaps, but we have been unable to find any examples of detentions of occupants of the premises until at least 1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.222" offset="14587341">And our point is simply that the detention ceases to be truly incident to the search where the individual has left the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.059" offset="14618688">The justifications for the detention evaporate at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.362" offset="14635929">Thank you.</text>
