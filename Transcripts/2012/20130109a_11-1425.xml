            <text syncTime="1605.913" offset="6529860">You also get two samples, so the defense can test it, and it is better evidence with respect to whether it's susceptible to challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.666" offset="6552847">You also might have someone who consents to a breath test, but because, as you pointed out, they're so drunk they can't give a good sample, like they say they'll provide a sample, but they really just can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.489" offset="6588165">And then there's another case that is not the fact here, but something we would want the Court to be careful about, which is driving under the influence of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.509" offset="6616273">Those do not show up on a breath test, but the police officers might have very good reason to believe that the person is under the influence, such that they might take a breath test and get a zero reading, but still want to take a warrantless blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.884" offset="6665696">So, all the Court needs to do to resolve this case is say where this person refused a breathalyzer -- actually, the exact same facts of Schmerber -- it was -- it was reasonable for the police to say, we know this evidence is going away, we know it's going to be lost, maybe we can get a warrant quickly, maybe we can't, we don't know what his blood alcohol is, we don't know when it's going to dip below.15,.08, let's just go ahead and proceed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.255" offset="12967163">The second thing I would say in response to your question, Justice Sotomayor, is -- is -- is biology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.076" offset="12986493">And that it is true that alcohol dissipates over time through natural body processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.813" offset="13009481">But that's only after the blood alcohol level has reached its peak, and that is generally about half an hour after somebody has had his last drink.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.752" offset="13041246">So there is a period of time in which the blood -- the body is continuing to absorb alcohol and then -- and the blood alcohol level is continuing to rise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.954" offset="13977997">--scrapings has been raised as saying well, that's -- somebody is going to scrape your fingernails, that's as intrusive as a blood test.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven R. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="3475.959" offset="14010075">Well, I would say three things, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.526" offset="14016345">I don't think it is as intrusive, although even in Cupp v. Murphy, which is that case, the Court described it as a serious but brief intrusion on the cherished value of personal security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.934" offset="14057932">The Court recognized that even the -- the fingernail scrape was -- was a serious Fourth Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.653" offset="14076844">Secondly, that evidence, unlike the blood alcohol evidence, was under the control of the defendant and in that case, on the facts of that case, much like many of the Court's other exigent circumstances cases, there was evidence that suggests that the defendant was actively engaged in the process of degrading the evidence at the time that the police stepped in and said we're going to preserve what is left rather than allow you to be the agent of your own destruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.036" offset="14174333">And as the Court said in Kentucky v. King, it is a very different situation when you have the defendant himself destroying evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.690" offset="14200978">Under those circumstances, it may be reasonable for the Court to say you can't simultaneously destroy evidence and then protest that the destruction of the evidence -- evidence has created the exigency that requires the State to act without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.098" offset="14250611">But there is no agency in this case on behalf of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.317" offset="14267434">The defendant has no capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.152" offset="14274852">And I come back to what I said before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.404" offset="14283838">It is true, I think this question came -- came up earlier, when Mr. Koester was being -- was being questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.108" offset="14310588">Fourth Amendment standards are not determined by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.626" offset="14320723">The Court has said that in Virginia v. Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.578" offset="14328456">We all understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.561" offset="14332426">But in the determination of what is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, this Court has often looked to State practices in response to Justice Kennedy's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.684" offset="14364923">In Tennessee v. Garner, you have the Court say half the States have abrogated the Common Law Rule that would have allowed the police to shoot any fleeing felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.040" offset="14398359">In Richards v. Wisconsin, you have half the States that not support an exception to the No Knock Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.425" offset="14419884">Here we have half the States in the country that would not have permitted what went on in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3588.433" offset="14459904">Everyone agrees that the closer a chemical test is taken to the time of driving, the more reliable the evidence of intoxication is, the more reliable the evidence of impairment is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.559" offset="14516433">So under the Respondent's approach, it would be mandated that we're going to allow the most reliable evidence to dissipate and degrade over a period of time in favor of admittedly less reliable evidence taken at a later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.502" offset="14584247">And I -- that's simply inconsistent with -- with Fourth Amendment jurisprudence and -- and other destruction of evidence cases.</text>
