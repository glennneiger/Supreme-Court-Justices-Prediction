            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="10.754" offset="148417">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.026" offset="177570">The Federal Tort Claims Act, FTCA waives the Federal Government sovereign immunity from suit for various tort claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.094" offset="221769">Petitioner Kim Millbrook, a federal prisoner filed a suit under the FTCA alleging that prison officials sexually assaulted and battered him.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.582" offset="271715">The Government moved to dismiss arguing that Millbrook could not be cover because Section 26 (a) (d) (h) of the FTCA, known as the “intentional tort exception” preserves the United States sovereign immunity from claims for intentional torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.398" offset="358964">Millbrook argued that the intentional tort exception was inapplicable because of the so-called, “law enforcement proviso”.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.176" offset="398148">This provision of the FTCA authorized a suit for certain intentional torts committed by federal law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.354" offset="438794">The Third Circuit disagreed with Millbrook.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.541" offset="451542">It held that the law enforcement proviso only waives sovereign immunity when the federal officer's conduct occurs in the course of executing a search, seizing evidence for making an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.161" offset="518102">The Court, thus, concluded that Millbrook's claims were barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.720" offset="536283">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reversed the judgment of the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.254" offset="562406">The FTCA's law enforcement proviso waive sovereign immunity for any claim “arising out of assault or battery” that is based on the acts or omissions of law enforcement officers of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.021" offset="633459">So long as the officer is acting within the scope of this employment, the proviso defines law enforcement officer to mean any officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, seize evidence, or to make arrest for violations of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.606" offset="723843">The question is whether the law enforcement proviso waives sovereign immunity for Millbrook's assault and battery claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.764" offset="756443">The Court of Appeals have taken three different approaches to the law enforcement proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.358" offset="778804">The Third Circuit limits the waiver to cases where law enforcement officers are executing a search, seizing evidence, or making an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.642" offset="828019">The Ninth Circuit's approach was slightly broader and holds its sovereign immunity as waived if a tort is committed while law enforcement officers are engaged in “law enforcement activity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="194.925" offset="885070">The final approach adapted by the Fourth Circuit only requires officers to be acting within the scope of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.057" offset="921642">We agreed with the last approach because it is consistent with the plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.727" offset="948287">The law enforcement proviso states when a law enforcement officers act or mission give rise to a tort claim under FTCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.984" offset="989351">The challenged conduct must arise from 106 enumerated intentional torts and the officer's acts or missions must fall within the scope of this office, his office or employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.458" offset="1043268">Nothing else in the text further qualifies what acts or missions trigger liability under the FTCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.902" offset="1077018">For this reason and other stated in the opinion, we hold that the law enforcement proviso extends to acts or missions of law enforcement officers that arise within the scope of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.676" offset="1128114">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
