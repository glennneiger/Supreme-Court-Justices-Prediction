            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">In case No. 11-1327, Evans versus Michigan, Justice Sotomayor has the opinion of the Court.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="8.274" offset="138491">This case concerns the right of a criminal defendant not to be retried after he has acquitted of an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.564" offset="167643">Petitioner Lamar Evans was charged with arson under a Michigan statute that criminalizes burning a building or other real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.265" offset="206514">The State's evidence at trial showed that the burned building was an unoccupied house.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.325" offset="230755">When the State rested its case, Evans moved for a directed verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.828" offset="256773">He pointed the trial court to the applicable pattern jury instructions which stated that an essential element of this offense is, “That the building was not a dwelling house.”</text>
            <text syncTime="50.329" offset="306719">That act is covered by a different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.891" offset="321034">Because the state have failed to prove that the building was not a dwelling house, the trial court acquitted Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.845" offset="352799">It turns out that the trial court was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.037" offset="365547">Under Michigan law, it is not necessary to disprove the greater offense of burning a house in order to establish the lesser offense of burning a building.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.578" offset="407761">So, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.663" offset="420091">The Court also held that retrying Evans would not violate the double jeopardy clause, because he had not actually been acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.670" offset="456140">The Court reasoned that the acquittal was not really an acquittal, because it was based on the States, fairly, had a proven an element of the offense that was not actually an element at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.425" offset="503160">The Michigan Supreme Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.340" offset="514759">We now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.411" offset="523013">Our cases have long established that there can be no retrial following an acquittal, even if the acquittal was based upon an egregiously, erroneous foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.760" offset="568466">The reason is that the double jeopardy clause protects a defendant's interest in having his guilt or innocence decided only once.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.057" offset="605665">Thus, we have held that an acquittal precludes retrial even when, for example, it is premised on a mistaken understanding of what evidence would suffice to sustain a conviction or upon a misconstruction of the statute, defining the requirements to convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.217" offset="678285">In essence, an acquittal is any ruling that the prosecution's proof is insufficient to establish a defendant's criminal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.701" offset="716215">That is what the trial court ruled here.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.692" offset="728231">As in our previous cases, the court's ruling was based on an antecedent legal error, but this ruling still went to the ultimate question of Evans' innocence or guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.316" offset="782670">Under our case law, it was therefore an acquittal that bars retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.430" offset="803150">The Michigan courts distinguished our previous cases on the ground that they involved the erroneous resolution of an actual element of the offense, whereas, here, no actual element of the relevant statute was resolved at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.031" offset="861560">We failed to perceive a meaningful difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.145" offset="873994">Whether we call a trial court's error, the misconstruction of an element of the offense as in our previous cases or the erroneous addition of an element of the offense as we have here, the defendant is declared not guilty because of the State's failure to prove some facts, it was not actually required to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.891" offset="965005">In both cases, the trial court has resolved the bottom line issue of the defendant's culpability and that is all that matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.528" offset="1003562">The State in the United States make additional arguments in support of affirmance, which we reject, for reasons discussed fully in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.384" offset="1038984">They also asked us to reconsider our past decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.092" offset="1053821">We declined to do so because our precedent has not become so unworkable as to justify overruling and the logic of our cases still hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.644" offset="1100006">Because Evans was acquitted, there should have been no appeal by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.870" offset="1116933">The judgment of the Michigan Supreme Court is therefore reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.664" offset="1132084">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
