            <text syncTime="9.856" offset="144892">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.658" offset="156072">This case has its origins in a decision by the British government in the Major Thatcher years to privatize a number of previously State-owned utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.180" offset="194211">The government's plan was to keep prices constant and allow the companies to make profits by increasing efficiencies and reducing costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.369" offset="226916">Only after an initial period in which prices would be fixed would the prices be re-jiggered and then savings passed on to the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.939" offset="253248">Now, this in practice worked very well for the companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.824" offset="268712">They were able to increase their efficiencies and cut costs to a greater extent than people expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.145" offset="290028">This was not, however, greeted as a uniform success.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.847" offset="304866">Instead, the opposition party criticized this, and said that the fat cats at the utility companies had earned too much, and the conservative government had made a mistake by valuing the shares at IPO too cheaply.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.587" offset="355752">And so they promised as an express election promise to impose a tax on the excess profits of privatized utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.257" offset="386472">And when elected, they made good on that promise and passed the Windfall Act--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="74.395" offset="402981">See, I have a problem with this argument because it assumes a way of looking at this, but it's an assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.482" offset="427328">You can look at it in either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.749" offset="436418">You can look at it as they made too much money, we want a part of that profit or they paid too little for what they got.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.040" offset="477587">And that was the debate going on in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.159" offset="490126">Did they pay too little on the floatation value, or did they make too much money?</text>
            <text syncTime="101.562" offset="511651">And what the government says -- rightly -- is, whether you paid too much or too little money depends on the value of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.401" offset="547073">And one of the factors that goes into that is how much money has the company made?</text>
            <text syncTime="116.572" offset="571732">And so you always have to look at profits to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.940" offset="585212">So what's wrong with looking at it their way?</text>
            <text syncTime="123.742" offset="600467">Why does it have to be your way?</text>

            <text syncTime="125.792" offset="608617">--Well, it has to be my way because of the way the specific tax was designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.546" offset="623664">But the first--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="130.646" offset="628052">No, you can only do it your way if you do what the amici says, which is to take out from your simplified equation the fact that the time -- the D element of your equation -- is constant.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.222" offset="686358">You artificially freeze it at the time at which they operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.975" offset="709346">Only by freezing that number can you come out with your equation.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.196" offset="730243">--Well, Your Honor, we're not artificially freezing the number.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.081" offset="745812">The number, the D -- 1461 for almost every company -- is itself part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.152" offset="770054">Because they picked a period by which they were going to measure the profit in value-making terms.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="171.373" offset="790952">But there was at least two or three companies that had a very different period and they paid a huge amount, much further than their gross profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.227" offset="822403">Because of that, D changed for them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="181.745" offset="832435">I can talk about the outlying companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.697" offset="840271">They paid a different effective rate because the D was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.483" offset="855422">But there's two important things to remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.251" offset="862423">One, I believe it's common ground between the parties that the way you apply this regulation is to look at the tax in -- to use the regulatory phrase -- in the normal circumstances in which it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.156" offset="906100">So I believe it's common ground that you ignore the outliers anyway.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="203.608" offset="919892">But you change the other part of the equation, or the tax regulation, which says it has to be true for all taxpayers.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="211.964" stopTime="270.314">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="211.964" offset="953329">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.630" offset="955941">That particular provision -- think of it as like a Clark v. Martinez principle for taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.034" offset="977571">They either are creditable or they're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.318" offset="986766">That's what that principle has been interpreted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.936" offset="997215">The case you should look at if you're really interested in it is the Exxon case, the tax court where we cite it in both our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.007" offset="1021457">And there, it was a situation where again, a British excess profits tax, in the main, it was an excess profits tax on the companies that were developing the North Sea oil field.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.279" offset="1062521">But as the tax applied to a couple of companies that really hadn't gotten any oil out, it applied very differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.349" offset="1086867">And the tax court and the government in that case both conceded no, you look at the tax in its main applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.418" offset="1107138">And in those main applications, everyone concedes that this tax operates exactly like a 51.75 percent tax on profits above a threshold, a threshold of four nights at the floatation value.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.744" offset="1160428">And that is not an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.144" offset="1166070">That's not some kind of tricky math thing that somebody pulled up, it's right there in the statute itself.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="270.314" stopTime="290.978">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="270.314" offset="1186655">Suppose everyone in the case conceded that the purpose of this statute was to compensate the government for having valued the shares at too low a price, and this was stated right in the enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.960" offset="1261261">Would that change your argument?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="290.978" offset="1269411">It wouldn't, Justice Kennedy, because at the end of the day, it's the substance of the tax, not its purpose behind it that matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.001" offset="1301489">Now, I do think in this case, as Justice Sotomayor alluded to, everybody in this process really understood that those were just the flip side of the same coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.423" offset="1335135">You can talk about the profits being too high vis -- vis floatation, you can talk about floatation being too low vis -- vis the subsequently reported profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.112" offset="1369930">But what makes--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="317.545" offset="1375677">Well, suppose we think this is both a tax on profits and a tax on low value, then what do we do?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="325.651" stopTime="390.009">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="325.651" offset="1408069">--Well, in this particular case, you would say it's creditable, because the only measure of value here is by looking at retrospective earnings over a 4-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.191" offset="1450178">And the best hypothetical I can give you is think about a foreign government that says we want to tax the value of corporations, but the way we are idiosyncratically going to measure value is to look at their earnings over the past year.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.833" offset="1500751">Now, I would hope that tax would be for U.S. substantive economic tax purposes fully creditable.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.254" offset="1526456">Of course it's a tax on income by our eyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.439" offset="1535233">Now, in saying that, you're not suggesting that the other country did something wrong or that's not value in their conception.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.343" offset="1562818">But the whole point that this Court made clear in the Biddle case going back 75 years ago is when you're looking at foreign taxes for purposes of applying the foreign tax credit, you don't take the foreign characterizations, the foreign classifications, as a given.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.936" offset="1621228">You look at the substance of the tax for our purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.555" offset="1631677">And if you look -- if you apply that mechanism to this tax, this tax looks exactly like a U.S. excess profits tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.325" offset="1662710">It is really--</text>

            <text syncTime="390.661" offset="1668039">Suppose it's a one -- if I could just -- suppose -- we say, well this is a one-time tax in order to recalculate, reassess the value.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.433" offset="1707223">If it's on income, it's still an excess profits tax in your view.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.836" offset="1728748">And of course, you could have had a one time, one-off tax, to use the British phrase, and you could have taxed the difference between the value at floatation and, let's say the London Stock Exchange price at some later point.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.476" offset="1771380">And that would have been the normal estimate of value, and it would not have been creditable for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.946" offset="1789248">But when you do what this tax uniquely did, which is you don't look at a normal rubric of value, but you look at a construct -- I mean, the very fact that they had to use the phrase “ value in profit-making terms ” tells you something weird's going on here.</text>

            <text syncTime="445.676" offset="1888199">Is there any instance in which a foreign tax credit has been given to something that looks like this, a one-time only adjustment that is -- that operates retrospectively on past earnings?</text>

            <text syncTime="470.141" offset="1986002">But I don't think that matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.576" offset="1991749">It's very clear I think for starters that the fact that this is a retroactive tax is not dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.730" offset="2016408">You look at one of the regulatory requirements, and that's realization.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.015" offset="2029470">And that treats an estimate of future income generation very differently, because that doesn't involve a realization event.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.090" offset="2189757">First, the big thing they want to tell you is, this is a normal way of valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.309" offset="2206684">And if you allow this, then any valuation is going to be creditable.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.344" offset="2218805">That is flat wrong, and the reason that's flat wrong is because almost every effort in valuation is prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.200" offset="2250257">If you want to try to value a piece of property, you could value it by saying, well, what kind of rents can I get on this property and I'll discount them back to net present value.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.205" offset="2282230">And I suppose you can conceive of a property tax as a tax on a percentage of those projected future earnings.</text>

            <text syncTime="851.329" offset="3510717">The reason they didn't care much is because those companies got something that the other companies didn't, which is they got to operate for the next three years in a favorable regulatory environment in which no excess profits tax would be imposed on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.089" offset="3569754">So it may look like they have a higher rate, effective rate, under our calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.376" offset="3586995">They do have a higher effective rate over a -- over a relatively small amount over the threshold, but they make that up, essentially, in the out-years because they make money under the favorable regulatory regime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.471" offset="4743383">Because a company that's valued 9 times its earnings earns about 11 point something percent per year, taking aside all other facts; and 2 years' worth is that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1487.358" offset="6054835">So let me try to come at it this way, which is to say, suppose you had a country that had a tax that said, we are going to tax your value and we are going to measure your -- your -- your value based on the income you made in the last year or the last 2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.415" offset="6103109">Now, I would say that that is clearly a creditable income tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.061" offset="6173639">The market cap would be different for every company, so there would be another thing that was different for each company, and the effective rate might be different but that's okay because that's how an excessive profits tax works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.250" offset="6214495">The last thing I'd say before I go sit down is that's how the 1917 United States Excess Profits Tax worked.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.885" offset="7109032">So then once I saw that, I looked at the first term.</text>

            <text syncTime="1758.739" offset="7140379">Their actual profit on an annual basis multiplied by about the same number, you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.078" offset="7169741">And so what we do is we take -- about multiplying, see -- so we take about two years' worth of profit that they actually made and we subtract from that two years' worth that our experts tell us they should have made on the basis of the original market price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.539" offset="7243615">The rest is excess profit and we seize all of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.943" offset="7265244">And by the way, if a company had only six months' worth, well, then, you know, they might really be hurt, because after all, they only earned six months at the annual rate that showed something, and maybe they didn't really earn it over the next 18 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.970" offset="7329297">But the reply was there was no such company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.922" offset="7341104">And, of course, because time periods vary, rates will vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.208" offset="7358240">But I don't know that that matters for an income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.677" offset="7372137">It's not a question of the rate; it's a question on what you impose it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2962.728" offset="11956314">That's not the relevant question, and I know there's some discussion about this in the brief, but if all you were to do were to compare the final tax bill to the company's net profits over the year, there's a lot of things that are not income taxes that would then become income taxes, like an excise tax that is charged on the number -- or the number of products that are manufactured or sold in a particular company in any given year, so long as there -- if it leaves the taxpayer with a nickel, then it's -- then that's an income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.245" offset="12070417">That's not what the income tax means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.028" offset="12077522">What matters is what the tax base is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.130" offset="12085986">That's how you determine if it's a tax on income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.915" offset="12097061">The realization test requires that, because you can't impose a tax on income that the taxpayer hasn't actually realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.669" offset="12124124">And the gross receipts and the net income tax also require it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.222" offset="12342299">Well, Justice Breyer, they're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.524" offset="12355569">SWEB, the subsidiary of Petitioner, paid the British income tax in the same years that it paid this windfall tax, in 1997 and 1998.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.813" offset="12396738">And Petitioner got a dollar-for-dollar foreign tax credit for its portion of that British income tax that was paid in those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.236" offset="12426413">For any other tax that's imposed by a foreign government that's not the income tax or that's not an excess profits tax or a war profits tax, the company can get a tax deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.441" offset="12463194">That's how classes -- or other taxes are normally treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.126" offset="12473956">You deduct from the amount of income that you are reporting to the IRS via the dollars that you paid toward that foreign tax, and the -- the value of that deduction depends on the marginal tax rate that the taxpayer is paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.451" offset="12523275">So you might get 35 cents on the dollar for every dollar that you can subtract from your income tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.503" offset="12543442">But the dollar-for-dollar credit in section 901 is reserved for foreign taxes that have the equivalent features of the U.S. income tax, and the windfall tax simply doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.211" offset="12582312">It's written as a valuation formula, and it's not just written that way, but that's the substance of what it's trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.597" offset="12607808">It's imputing a value on each company for what the U.K. government should have charged, and it's subtracting out the amount of money that it actually received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.118" offset="12637901">And I think that's an important point to keep in mind when determining what is the -- the substance of the tax, is that the U.K. government is not just going out into the world and taxing companies that it thinks are particularly profitable, to try to get more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.944" offset="12693176">The U.K. government used to own these companies, and it sold them at too low a price, and the windfall tax is an effort to get back some of that value that it should have asked for when it sold them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.500" offset="12735494">Whether that's a good idea or a bad idea, it's not an income tax, in the U.S. sense, and it should not be entitled to a credit under section 901.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.325" offset="12794740">Just a few quick points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.825" offset="12800696">First of all, just for the record, if what they really wanted to do in the British government was to tax value as we normally understood it, there was a ready mechanism available, the London Stock Exchange price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.549" offset="12843641">Now they want to say, well, but we wanted to go back and value it in 1990, but as alluded to, they could have done that because on day one, there was about a 20 percent pop -- to use the IPO word -- there's about a 20 percent pop in value at the end of the first day's trading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.143" offset="12902051">They could have taxed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.259" offset="12906439">If they wanted to be a little less precise but capture a little more value, they could have gone 30 days out or 60 days out, on the theory that it took a while for the information to make it in to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.832" offset="12940817">That would have been a value tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.933" offset="12945205">I wouldn't be up here arguing that it's creditable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.166" offset="12954087">But what they did was something very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.068" offset="12961715">They used a sui generis, very unique concept of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.354" offset="12974880">Not value unmodified, but value in profit-making terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.739" offset="12988359">And not profit-making terms in some abstract sense that takes into account future income streams, but profit-making terms as measured by 4 years of reported profits that satisfy every test of the regulation: They're realized profits, they're based on gross receipts, and they reflect exactly to the penny, to the pence, the net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.720" offset="13064323">That's what they base this tax--</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="3241.270" offset="13070488">Mr. Clement, what do you think would -- is the answer -- suppose that the Labour government had come in, not after 4 years but after 2 years, that they looked at those 2 years of profits, they said that's enough for us to know that these companies were grossly undervalued, and they had done this exact same formula, and the result is that they would have ended up with a tax rate of over 100 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.168" offset="13162126">Would that have been creditable or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="3266.353" offset="13170903">--I would be here with a more difficult case, Justice Kagan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.139" offset="13181979">I would love to argue that that is still creditable, because I think you could live in a country that has an income tax, especially an excess profits tax of a few disfavored industries, that has a rate over 100 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.713" offset="13232343">But I would run into a regulatory hurdle, and if I had had that case, I would have had to challenge the regulations.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="3288.284" offset="13258570">I guess what the hypothetical suggests is that in some respects, the fact that you now -- that you have a tax rate here of between zero and 1 is a bit of a fluke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.723" offset="13292320">You know, if they had come in a little bit earlier and done the exact same thing, based on their understanding of how profitable these companies were, which they would have seen after 2 years, you wouldn't have been able to make the same argument.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="3310.463" offset="13347282">Can I just say, though, it wouldn't have been a fluke, because one of the things that the people that constructed this tax wanted out of this tax is they wanted it paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.819" offset="13380719">So it's not a fluke that they didn't impose a huge tax in excess of initial period profits on any company, because they wanted to make sure the incidence of this tax was on companies that could actually pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.627" offset="13427948">And if you do that based on 4 years' of reported profits, you're pretty sure that people are going to be able to pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.362" offset="13450936">I would like to bring back to the concession I think that ultimately was made by the government, that if a foreign government has a tax on value, that the only measure of value is the past years' reported income, that that would be a creditable income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.204" offset="13506315">Well, I don't think it changes if you multiply it by 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.056" offset="13517705">I don't think it changes if you divide it by 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.592" offset="13527840">I don't think if there is one company, that you divide it by 1/4 instead of 4 -- that any of that changes the analysis, nor does it change the analysis if you subtract out some figure that represents a market cap or initial floatation value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.185" offset="13582175">That would make it an excess profits tax rather than a simple income tax, and that is what the British government did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.570" offset="13603700">I'll just close by bringing you back 75 years to the Biddle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.706" offset="13616239">In the Biddle case, there was an argument about a British tax, and whether we should follow the form of the tax or the substance of this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.276" offset="13642570">This Court said that we of course, in looking at a foreign tax, don't bind ourselves by foreign classifications or characterizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.880" offset="13672977">We look to the substance of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.816" offset="13680709">In the Biddle case, the rule that you look to substance not form benefited the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.452" offset="13699203">There's no reason for a different rule when the shoe is on the other foot.</text>
