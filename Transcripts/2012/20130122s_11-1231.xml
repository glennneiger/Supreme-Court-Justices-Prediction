            <text syncTime="8.086" offset="138783">Hospitals providing Medicare services may pursue an administrative appeal from the initial determination of the amount of reimbursement they qualify to receive from the Department of Health and Human Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.001" offset="202418">This case concerns the time within which the internal appeal maybe pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.803" offset="237631">Under the Medicare Act, a government contractor, known as a fiscal intermediary, annually determines the reimbursement amount due each hospital in the intermediary's area.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.845" offset="289876">A hospital that disagrees with the intermediary -- intermediary's calculation, the Medicare Act provides -- may appeal to an -- to an administrative body called the Provider Reimbursement Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.182" offset="351211">Such an administrative appeal, the Act specifies, must be brought within a 180-day timeframe.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.692" offset="385170">In 1974, HHS adopted a regulation allowing the board to extend the 180-day period for a maximum of three years if the hospital shows good cause for the appeal-filing delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.266" offset="451521">But three years is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.033" offset="458627">The regulation wins.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.913" offset="466045">No appeal filed after that time will be entertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.755" offset="485480">In 2006, the board released a decision in an appeal timely brought by a hospital that is not a party to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.232" offset="527381">In that decision, the board determined that the intermediary's reimbursement calculation was flawed because the Government had not given the intermediary the best available data.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.013" offset="586522">Many other hospitals were similarly disadvantaged by the government's flawed calculations and likely had been underpaid for the Medicare services they provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.675" offset="633125">The hospitals in this case sought to piggyback on the board's determination in the timely appealed case.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.547" offset="664680">Their appeal, however, was brought more than a decade after the 180-day clock ran out.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.071" offset="702715">To overcome this obstacle, the hospitals invoked a doctrine called equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.518" offset="728524">“The clock should be stopped,” they urged, until the Government's use of faulty data came to light.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.883" offset="761960">The board refused to consider the untimely appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.929" offset="778156">Under -- under the HHS regulation, the board observed three years was the maximum stretch permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.919" offset="810130">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.632" offset="824968">There is a presumption, the appellate court said, that equitable tolling applies to limitation periods stated in federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.180" offset="863211">Under that presumption, the court ruled, it was open to the hospitals to argue to the board that in fairness, they should be allowed to present their long post-deadline appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.186" offset="915143">We reversed the Court of Appeal's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.551" offset="928622">First, we agree with both parties and the DC Circuit that the statute's 180-day limit on provider appeals is not jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.110" offset="970836">That is, it does absolutely preclude HHS from allowing appeals once 180 days runs out.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.247" offset="1011482">But we also hold that the regulation which puts a firm three-year limit on late appeals was within the bounds of HHS' authority under the Medicare Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.781" offset="1057562">But we need to type the 180-day statute -- statutory deadline jurisdictional, it would mean that under no circumstances could the board hear and appeal outside the 180-day window.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.996" offset="1114405">Consequently, HHS' provision of a three-year outer limit would fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.310" offset="1139691">The language Congress used does not support such an iron bar to late appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.485" offset="1164351">Several of our recent decisions confirm the directions like the statutory 180-day limit are claimed processing rules, not jurisdictional barriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.717" offset="1209281">There is a next question and it is dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.072" offset="1226731">Given that HHS could adopt the three-year for good cause dispensation, could the department legitimately say, “This much, three years, but no more.”</text>
            <text syncTime="292.817" offset="1277722">Our answer is, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="294.982" offset="1286395">The presumption of equitable tolling relied on by the DC Circuit generally applies to limitations on commencing suit in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.498" offset="1324429">We have never applied the presumption to an agency's deadline for appeals inside the agency and we declined to do so for the provider appeals that issued here.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.150" offset="1371032">The presumption of equitable tolling is based in part on the premise that Congress ordinarily attends to allow such tolling, but that premise is inept in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.704" offset="1417216">The regulation as just observed, controls what goes on inside an agency, not what leeway, a court can allow when a case travels from agency to a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.161" offset="1467058">The time prescription before us has remained in place for nearly 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.339" offset="1487851">Congress amended the underlying statutory section six times in that period without indicating any disapproval of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.707" offset="1525258">We further note that unlike some administrative review -- review schemes, the Medicare provider appeal system applies not to vulnerable unsophisticated individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.506" offset="1580429">Rather, it applies exclusively to sophisticated, well-counseled institutions, who -- who we'd like to participate in the Medicare system and do so with notice of HHS' regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.486" offset="1640406">We hold in some that the regulation at issue is a permissible construction of the administrative appeal scheme, Congress enacted, hence HHS acted within its authority when it declared the hospitals' administrative appeals time-barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.533" offset="1704563">The Court's opinion is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.897" offset="1714072">Justice Sotomayor has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
