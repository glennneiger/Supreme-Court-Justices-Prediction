            <text syncTime="201.397" offset="911523">Well, in Comstock, it was very different than the situation here, because the analysis was that the Federal Government basically was the source of the problem in incarcerating sex offenders away from the State so that no State felt an obligation to do something with the problem of their release.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.924" offset="977665">You don't have anything of that sort here.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.359" offset="987382">This provision, Mr. Chief Justice, rests on a different analysis than Comstock.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.846" offset="1009325">In Comstock, the problem was caused by Federal custody that, as Your Honor has said, broke the relationship between the individual and some State that might take cognizance of him for purposes of sex offender civil commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.689" offset="1072751">The basis for the statute in Comstock was that people in Federal custody, regardless of the nature of their prior convictions, might pose threats if released.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.014" offset="1117995">The basis for the statute in this case is not that the individual was in Federal custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.668" offset="1140669">Federal custody is irrelevant to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.536" offset="1148088">The basis for the statute in this case is that this is a sex offender in violation of Federal law, and Congress has the authority to impose, as was done in this case, criminal punishment, but it also has the authority to impose civil regulatory sanctions.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.347" offset="1315376">I mean, nothing peculiar here about sex crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.981" offset="1329900">Any -- any crime Congress can later decide, you know, it would be a good idea if when -- when a person has committed, I don't know, crime with the use of a gun, we -- we impose retroactively all sorts of different civil limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.657" offset="1584542">Except for a brief interlude under United States v.

            <text syncTime="541.036" offset="2270099">So start with a sex offender who commits a sex offense in the military, is tried, court-martialed and sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.023" offset="2298102">Subject to cruel and unusual punishment limitations, due process limitations, et cetera, that individual can be incarcerated, placed on supervised release potentially up to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.199" offset="2350765">A condition of supervised release, well-recognized and now mandated by Federal law, is that that individual register as a sex offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.555" offset="2388173">And the reason that that is tied to Federal law is that when an individual violates Federal law it is a legitimate purpose of Congress to protect the public against recidivism by that individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.713" offset="2440835">So that's the criminal example that I believe is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.332" offset="2455255">Now, suppose that the Federal Government didn't actually get the sex offender while he was in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.087" offset="2482318">It missed the crime, but later information comes to light still within the statute of limitations that shows that while this person was in the military they committed a sex offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.776" offset="2521084">This court in United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles made clear that that individual can be tried in an Article III court for his criminal violation even though he's out of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.684" offset="2572702">It's enforcing the rules that were impressed upon him at the time while he was in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.940" offset="2597675">Now let me give a civil example and then I will bring it right back to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.059" offset="2618155">Suppose that Congress concludes that sex offenses in the military are a very serious problem and that there are a lot of people who have escaped prosecution because of lax interest in pursuing those crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.299" offset="2667160">And after a period of years, it sets up a board of inquiry and it says this board of inquiry is going to look into sex offenses that were committed at the time that people were in the military, even if they're out of the military, and we're going to subpoena people to testify, and if individuals are determined in a civil proceeding to have committed sex offenses they may have their military records revised, they may lose military benefits, and they may have other civil sanctions imposed upon them.</text>

            <text syncTime="773.719" offset="3200790">The Federal Government offers financial support, it offers logistical assistance, it offers tremendous resources of the U.S. marshals to track down sex offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.444" offset="3243735">And as this Court said in Carr v. United States, it was entirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned a special responsibility for prosecuting Federal sex offenders who failed to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.371" offset="3299428">This was integral to this Court's reasoning in Carr, where the Court was confronted with two provisions of 2250, the criminal sex offense provision under SORNA.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.515" offset="3576013">In an opinion that you wrote for the Court, Smith v. Doe, which considered the retroactivity of Alaska's sex offender registration and notification provisions, which are similar but not identical, to the Federal provisions, the Court went through the established analysis to determine whether the legislature had intended a punitive effect and if it didn't, whether there was the clearest proof that it was punishment in purpose and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.832" offset="3685309">Notwithstanding the legislature's intent, the Court upheld the retroactive applicability of sex offender registration and notification, making clear that it is not governed by the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.508" offset="3735987">Now, that's not to say that an individual couldn't argue that SORNA is different or an individual couldn't argue that the Due Process Clause makes it either irrational or substantively off limits to impose this kind of civil remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.185" offset="3798680">The individual can also argue that running this through the Comstock factors, it's not reasonably adapted to fulfilling Congress's aim.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.291" offset="3839118">But what the Fifth Circuit did is apply a per se rule that it drew, I think, from the Solicitor General's statement in Comstock that once an individual got out of custody and was back in the control of the State and within its jurisdiction and population, then the Federal Government couldn't reach out and commit him as a sex offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.753" offset="3920933">And there are two main distinctions between that concession and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.989" offset="3937965">The first is, as I've already alluded to, the Government's argument in Comstock was based on custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.243" offset="3962938">This case is based on the consequences of the conviction itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.880" offset="3981433">The second distinction is that committing somebody civilly is a massive intrusion on that individual's relationship with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.820" offset="4017273">The individual has been brought within Federal custody; they have no relationship with the State anymore.</text>

            <text syncTime="3447.453" offset="13895738">First of all, a standard condition of Federal supervised release is that the individual shall not violate any Federal, State or local law, and for many sex offenders, supervised release runs for life.</text>

            <text syncTime="3483.526" offset="14040039">But second, if Congress passed such a law, it's not that it has carte blanche to do that, it's just that there's no per se rule that says it can't.</text>
