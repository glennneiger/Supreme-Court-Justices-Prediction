            <text syncTime="295.441" offset="1288705">And in fact the other factors that the Court considers when looking at stare decisis is: What were the margins of vote on the previous cases, and McMillan was decided on a 5-4 decision, whereas Harris, as we've noted, was a plurality decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.200" offset="1343771">Both opinions were found over spirited dissents.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.402" offset="1356623">They have been criticized by this Court and the lower courts, and in all of those instances we believe that stare decisis is at its weakest.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.435" offset="3532728">And the jury verdict in this case authorized a range of 5 years as the bottom.</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.187" offset="12979755">We -- the critical point about Apprendi is by assigning the role of constitutional element status to a fact that increases the maximum, the Court has preserved the jury trial right against its reduction to essentially a formality on a particular subset of elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.135" offset="13075468">And the relationship of a crime that's covered by Apprendi and the so-called base crime is like a greater included offense and a lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.276" offset="13124055">Whereas, in the mandatory minimum situation, we know that the judge will be engaged in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.864" offset="13154462">We know that the judge will find facts that extend beyond the elements of the crime to inform himself about how the basic crime is committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.322" offset="13192287">We also know that different judges may treat those facts differently after finding them by the preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.326" offset="13220290">The mandatory minimum changes only one thing: It says, Judge, if you find this fact, brandishing or discharge, you will impose the same sentence as your neighboring judge down the hall, not a different one based on your different perception of sentencing philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.137" offset="13295523">So it allows the legislature to intervene after having defined a sufficiently serious enough crime and determine how the judges will treat those facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.207" offset="13623830">And we are not talking about a right to leniency, but a right for the judge to consider the full range that the jury authorized.</text>
