            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Breyer has the opinion of the Court in two cases this morning.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="5.131" stopTime="484.128">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="5.131" offset="126976">The first case is Kirtsaeng versus John Wiley, and the respondent is John Wiley and Sons as a publisher of textbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.665" offset="165115">It holds a copyright on certain textbooks that it publishes in the United States, but it's granted an Asian subsidiary the right to publish the same textbooks abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.820" offset="209732">The petitioner, Supap Kirtsaeng is a Thai national who is studying on a scholarship in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.082" offset="238780">He discovered that the Asian edition of his textbooks that Wiley had licensed was cheaper and he had his friends in relations buy copies of that edition in Thailand, send them to him in the United States, and he resold them at a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.416" offset="304086">Because of a copyright law provision called “the first-sale doctrine,” if Kirtsaeng or anyone else had bought copies made in the United States after he bought them, he would be free to resell them.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.188" offset="367198">The first-sale doctrine provides that if you buy a first -- the first -- if you a first-sale, once the book is sold, that exhausts the copyright and the buyer is pretty much free, you or anybody else, to do what he wants with the copy that he's bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.412" offset="432086">But does that doctrine, which is in Section 109 of a Copyright Act, does that doctrine apply when the copy was made not in the United States, but it was made abroad?</text>
            <text syncTime="95.411" offset="488093">That legal question is difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.949" offset="498228">We held in a case called Quality King that the first-sale doctrine is a defense in a copyright infringement suit that involved the importation of a book from abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.874" offset="549951">And we further said it wasn't relevant whether the first-sale took place domestically or abroad, but Quality King was a case where the copyrighted items were made in the United States and they were sent abroad and somebody was trying to bring them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.695" offset="621213">But here, the copies were made abroad and that fact is important because Section 109 of the Copyright Doctrine says that first law -- says that the first-sale doctrine applies to copies “lawfully made under this title.”</text>
            <text syncTime="146.607" offset="692893">So, what do those five words, “lawfully made under in this title,” what do those five words mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="153.339" offset="719851">Should we interpret them geographically?</text>
            <text syncTime="156.310" offset="731658">Holding that they apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="158.371" offset="739913">And does the first-sale doctrine applies only to copies that have been made in the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="164.681" offset="765200">That is what Wiley and the Solicitor General roughly argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.846" offset="785784">Or should we interpret the words non-geographically?</text>
            <text syncTime="173.413" offset="800099">As applying to copies, whether made here or abroad, but have been made in accordance with the Copyrights Act requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.461" offset="836253">That is what Kirtsaeng argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.131" offset="847015">Ultimately, we conclude that Kirtsaeng's is the better interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.369" offset="867913">It is more consistent with the legislative intent that the act reflects.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.624" offset="888916">Four sets of considerations lead us to this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.166" offset="907097">First, we think the language leans at least slightly in Kirtsaeng's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.005" offset="930503">As interpreted non-geographically, those five words, “lawfully made under this title,” basically distinguished, lawfully made copies from pirated copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.369" offset="983897">Protecting purchasers only when they -- when what they buy has been lawfully made, according to the U.S. Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.973" offset="1014303">The geographical interpretation, however, bristles with linguistic difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.596" offset="1036873">Since the phrase says nothing about geography, Wiley, for example, must claim that it refers to where the act applies and then add the act does not apply to copies made abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.284" offset="1083580">It doesn't, why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="246.194" offset="1091208">At least linguistically speaking, a statute that imposes a tariff on rhododendrons grown in Nepal applies in some sense to those foreign rhododendrons from the day they first bud.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.103" offset="1146901">Second, the context, including the history of the 1976 revisions to the act, indicates that Congress used those five words in the statute, not to prevent the doctrine from applying to sales abroad, but to achieve totally unrelated purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.563" offset="1216700">Third, we normally approach relevant statutory text with an assumption that Congress intended to codify, not to displace a well-established common law doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.544" offset="1264661">And the first-sale doctrine is a historically venerable common law doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.254" offset="1287440">About a century before the framers wrote our Constitution, Lord Coke in his treatise on Littleton explained that the English common law had long embodied that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.310" offset="1335714">It reflected the commercial need not unnecessarily to interfere with competition and trade, as well as the practical difficulties that would have accompanied any judicial effort to trace what a purchaser of movable goods was doing with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.221" offset="1407289">In 1908, this Court involves Merrill, a well-known copyright case held that the Copyright Law embodied, in some sense, this doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.884" offset="1441980">And of course, Congress codified the doctrine in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.820" offset="1461729">Forth, to accept the contrary geographical interpretation threatened serious copyright related harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.001" offset="1490463">Library associations tell us that they buy many thousands of books printed abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.028" offset="1514600">The libraries do not necessarily obtain permission to circulate those books in the United States after they buy them.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.947" offset="1542186">How are they to find the copyright owners and obtain that permission?</text>
            <text syncTime="363.249" offset="1559427">Should they stop circulating the books?</text>
            <text syncTime="366.163" offset="1571129">Used-book dealers tell us that for similar reasons, the geographical interpretation threatens their trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.947" offset="1598192">Retailers of billions of dollars' worth of imported merchandise often with copyrighted labels, shapes, design or instructions, tell us again for similar reasons that they faced similar threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.917" offset="1650124">Museums tell us that they may find it difficult to display 20th century paintings on loan from foreign museums without also obtaining permission from the copyright holders, perhaps the artist or his heirs, who may be difficult to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.659" offset="1705085">Can a student resell a used textbook bought abroad?</text>
            <text syncTime="402.836" offset="1717833">Can a buyer of a foreign automobile, which typically contains many pieces of copyright and software, resell the car as used?</text>
            <text syncTime="410.029" offset="1746568">Whom should they contact to get the necessary permissions?</text>
            <text syncTime="413.943" offset="1762241">There maybe answers to these problems, but they're just seem to us too many linguistic and other hurdles preventing the adoption of other answers to rely upon alternative interpretive solutions to keep these problems within bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.659" offset="1821069">Nor can we rely simply upon the hope that copyright holders would not enforce their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.751" offset="1845415">To rely upon widespread non-compliance, to make the law workable risks undermining habits of obedience, thereby threatening respect for the copyright law itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.262" offset="1891495">For these reasons and other set forth in our opinion, we conclude that petitioner Kirtsaeng has correctly interpreted the statute and we set aside the lower court's decision to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.931" offset="1938202">Justice Kagan has filed the concurring opinion in which she is joined by Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.526" offset="1960563">The interpretive question is, as I said, a difficult one.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.225" offset="1975296">And the arguments for a contrary interpretation are clearly set forth in the dissenting opinion written by Justice Ginsburg in which she is joined by Justice Kennedy and in which Justice Scalia joins except as to parts 3 and 5 (b)(1).</text>
