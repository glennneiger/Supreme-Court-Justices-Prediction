            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Kennedy has the opinion of the Court in two cases this morning.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="4.166" offset="123110">The first opinion is in the cases of Decker versus Northwestern -- Northwest Environmental Defense Center, and Georgia Pacific West versus Northwest Environmental Defense Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.914" offset="166055">The Clean Water Act established a general rule that permits are required before pollutants may be discharged from any point source into the navigable waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.723" offset="213285">Congress later amended the Act to exempt most discharges composed entirely of stormwater because there is so much stormwater.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.515" offset="244527">A few types of stormwater discharges, however, still require permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.632" offset="260932">As relevant here, permits are required for stormwater discharges that are associated with industrial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.735" offset="289353">And the term “associated with industrial activity” covers only discharges under the statute, directly related to manufacturing, processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.915" offset="342120">Petitioner Georgia-Pacific has a contract with Oregon to harvest timber from a state forest, west of Portland, Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.960" offset="370333">It rains a lot in this part of Oregon, in some places more than 100 inches a year, so water runs off to logging roads used by the petitioner and into the ditches and culverts, and channels that discharge the water into nearby streams and rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.252" offset="427489">And the discharge often contains sediment that may be harmful to fish or other aquatic organisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.359" offset="451835">Respondent Northwest Environmental Defense Center filed suit against Georgia-Pacific and state and local governments and officials and alleged that the defendant should have obtained permits before discharging stormwater runoff from the logging roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.425" offset="504184">The District Court dismissed the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.245" offset="511394">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.681" offset="521216">The Court of Appeals held that the discharges from the logging roads did require permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.433" offset="540129">That is because, in their view, they were associated with industrial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.914" offset="558101">The Court of Appeals decision was contrary to the EPA's interpretation of its regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.945" offset="582238">Now, just before the oral argument in these cases, the EPA issued a final version of an amendment to its storm -- to its industrial stormwater rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.699" offset="621213">And that amendment clarified that the permit requirement applies only to a certain subset of logging operations, but not the logging roads like the ones here.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.111" offset="658934">The new regulation does not make these cases moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.484" offset="672413">The preamendment version of the regulation governed the petitioner's past discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.927" offset="690176">It might be the basis for the imposition of penalties even if, in the future, the discharges are allowed without a permit under the new amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.481" offset="720374">So in this case, the Court now turns to the preamendment version of the Industrial Stormwater Rule and the Court finds that the preamendment rule is a permissible construction by the EPA of the statutory term associated with industrial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.316" offset="775753">As such, it exempts from the permitting scheme, discharges of channeled stormwater runoff from the logging roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.596" offset="800831">When an agency interprets its own regulation, the Court, as a general rule, defers to it unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.971" offset="846284">This principle is often referred to as the Auer, as Auer deference, A-U-E-R, after the Court's ruling in the case of Auer versus Robbins.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.198" offset="895185">Here, it was reasonable for the EPA to conclude that under the regulatory scheme, the permit requirement extends only to traditional industrial buildings such as factories and other relatively fixed facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.406" offset="940116">For example, a sawmill might be a site for which discharge permits are required, but these logging roads are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.258" offset="963521">The EPA has been consistent in this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.798" offset="973657">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.844" offset="981807">The cases are remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.001" offset="994450">The Chief Justice has filed a concurring opinion, in which Justice Alito joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.398" offset="1012005">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part in and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.350" offset="1027887">Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</text>
