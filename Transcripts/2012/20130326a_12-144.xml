            <text syncTime="4637.234" offset="18654648">And, you know, I'm glad that counsel for the Respondents mentioned the Loving case, because what this Court -- what this Court ultimately said was patently obvious, is that the colors of the skin of the spouses is irrelevant to any legitimate purpose, no more so than their hair colors, any legitimate purpose of marriage, that interracial couples and same-race couples are similarly situated in every respect with respect to any legitimate purpose of marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.426" offset="18807412">That's what this question really boils down here, whether or not it can be said that for every legitimate purpose of marriage, are opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples indistinguishable, indistinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.722" offset="18880555">And with all due respect to counsel and to the Respondents, that is not a hard question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.659" offset="18912320">If, in fact, it is true, as the people of California believe that it still is true, that the natural procreative capacity of opposite-sex couples continues to pose vitally important benefits and risks to society, and that's why marriage itself is the institution that society has always used to regulate those heterosexual, procreative -- procreative relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.215" offset="19038544">Counsel -- the Solicitor General has said that the ban that the proposition erects in California is permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.940" offset="19093401">Well, it's -- certainly that is not the view of the Respondents and what we read every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.146" offset="19134256">This is not an issue that is now at rest in the State of California, regardless -- well, unless this Court essentially puts it to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.019" offset="19173753">That democratic debate, which is roiling throughout this country, will definitely be coming back to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.893" offset="19213251">It is an agonizingly difficult, for many people, political question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.730" offset="19240627">We would submit to you that that question is properly decided by the people themselves.</text>
