            <text syncTime="6.654" offset="132536">Mr. Feldman?</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="7.704" offset="136716">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.439" offset="147687">As the language and structure of the Gonzalez Act demonstrate, Congress did not completely eliminate the long-recognized tort remedy that's available to essentially everybody else in the country when doctors perform surgery without a patient's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.715" offset="204843">By abrogating the intentional tort exception to the FTCA for the class of cases covered by the Gonzalez Act, Congress both preserved a remedy for the victims of that tort, and, by virtue of the Gonzalez Act's exclusive remedy provision, they made certain that the Federal employees themselves would not be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.927" offset="281643">As everyone understood at the time of the enactment, that was the meaning of the terms of the Gonzalez Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.849" offset="309333">The Act has two clauses, an operative clause and an introductory clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.135" offset="326469">The operative clause says in simple declarative terms that the intentional tort exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act shall not apply to any cause of action arising out of a wrongful act or omission in the performance of medical functions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="70.060" stopTime="93.324">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="70.060" offset="386133">Mr. Feldman, but it says first for purposes of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.064" offset="406195">And as I understand your argument, those words don't count.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.535" offset="436079">In other words, you would be making -- you would interpret the statute the same way if the sentence started with the provisions of Section 2680(h).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="93.324" stopTime="181.865">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="93.324" offset="479234">No, Your Honor, that's not right.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.009" offset="486025">We -- that -- the part after the introductory clause says:</text>
            <text syncTime="100.997" offset="509954">"The provisions of the intentional tort exception shall not apply to medical malpractice cases. "</text>
            <text syncTime="106.566" offset="532210">And that would make it apply across the government to any government employee who is performing those medical functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.137" offset="554466">By saying for purposes of this section, Congress limited it in accordance with the case -- the agency by agency approach that it had adopted in this area, and limited it to just the cases that are covered by the Gonzalez Act; that is, by malpractice that's committed by doctors of the Department of Defense, the National Guard, the Armed Forces Retirement Home, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.301" offset="639103">And so the -- each clause serves quite an important function.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.836" offset="657284">Congress had before the Gonzalez Act -- they had already passed the statutes dealing, for example, with the Public Health Service that's essentially written in the same terms, with the Veterans Administration -- although part of that would have been added later -- with the State Department doctors, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.814" offset="725203">And so they were proceeding on an agency-by-agency basis, and the way to accomplish that was to first say, We -- we think that the intentional tort exception should not apply to these cases, because medical batteries of the sort that we -- as alleged in this case are so close to the kinds of medical malpractice cases that are going to be brought against the government anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.176" offset="798659">But then in each statute, they say for purposes of this section, because it's only the agencies, only the personnel covered by those sections, and the torts covered by those sections.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="181.865" stopTime="184.733">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="181.865" offset="833454">In the Veterans Administration, it doesn't say that, does it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="184.733" stopTime="249.526">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="184.733" offset="844843">The Veterans Administration -- originally, the original Veterans Administration statute, which was from about 1965, doesn't have this 1089(e) intentional tort exception at all in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.160" offset="898551">But then they added it later about 10 years after this statute, and then they added a provision that was slightly worded differently, but it achieves exactly the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.099" offset="938362">Instead of saying for purposes of this section, it says</text>
            <text syncTime="210.384" offset="947452">"by the personnel named in Section A, which accomplishes exactly the same thing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="215.622" offset="968455">And actually if you look at the history of that statute, the Senate report on that statute quite clearly recites that Congress understood that 1089(e), the statute here, has exactly the effect that I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.214" offset="1026760">And they said, We are modeling it on that provision, and then they did tinker with the wording, and there's actually no explanation for the specific change.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.868" offset="1057376">But it's not uncommon that in statutes that have been reviewed by different committees and passed 10 or 12 years apart, that Congress would have a -- they would use slightly different language to achieve essentially the same purpose.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="249.526" offset="1104083">What would -- what do you do, if anything, about those of us, I hope more than one, who actually look at legislative history and the House and Senate Report, the Senate Report says subsection (e) would nullify a provision of the Tort Claims Act which would otherwise exclude any action for assault and battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.724" offset="1200840">Then the House says about the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.493" offset="1211916">So when I look at those two things, I think the purpose of this Act was to do just exactly what the other side says: It was to get rid of assault and battery as an exception and said the government of the United States will pay for unlawful assault and battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.936" offset="1269699">That's what the two reports say.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.205" offset="1274714">That's why they passed it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="293.522" stopTime="339.353">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="293.522" offset="1280043">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.605" offset="1284327">I believe actually that's our -- that's the way we read it, exactly like that, which is the -- by nullifying the intentional tort exception -- what the intentional tort exception provides is -- actually what it says is:</text>
            <text syncTime="305.513" offset="1328004">"The provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act shall not apply to any case arising out of assault, battery. "</text>
            <text syncTime="311.849" offset="1353291">and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.666" offset="1356634">And by eliminating that, the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act are otherwise totally applicable to cases of medical battery, like this, or other claims of intentional tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.391" offset="1395505">And so for cases covered by the Gonzalez Act; that is, cases of medical malpractice committed within the scope of employment by the doctors of the certain specified agencies that Congress has named for those cases, there is no intentional tort exception, and therefore, you can bring an action against the government.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="339.353" offset="1463318">I don't quite understand your answer to Justice Ginsburg on the for purposes of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.988" offset="1485888">What the section does is provide that the remedy against the United States is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.641" offset="1504487">But what 1089(e) goes on to say is that the 2680(h) provision doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.099" offset="1550358">So I don't see how that -- I mean, the -- the reference is to the exclusivity, not to the waiver of the limitation on -- on intentional torts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="371.638" stopTime="441.134">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="371.638" offset="1592468">Well, I don't think that that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.990" offset="1601872">I mean, I think for purposes of this section you have to read it in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.026" offset="1614097">And the fact is that 2680 -- the term 2680(h) of Title 28 doesn't appear elsewhere in the Gonzales Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.465" offset="1643772">And the only work that that provision does in the law, section -- the intentional tort exception, 2680(h) of Title 28, the only work that that does is to make the -- is in the Federal Tort Claims Act, is to make the Act inapplicable to those kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.057" offset="1706153">So when they say in simple terms that shall not apply, all that could mean, all that could possibly mean, is you eliminate that and then you have the Tort Claims Act how it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.199" offset="1746695">And then what the four purposes of this section does is say, but we're not doing that across the board for every Federal employee everywhere or even every malpractice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.453" offset="1779714">We are just doing it for the claims that are covered, for the cases that are covered in this section, for purposes of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.423" offset="1803642">In this section, if you look at (a) then, which is the basic exclusive remedy provision that Your Honor mentioned, what (a) does is deal specifically with -- with medical malpractice committed by doctors and personnel.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="441.134" offset="1870515">One of the strongest arguments by your adversary has to do with the incongruity between these claims and the Westfall ruling by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.776" offset="1913043">It's more a policy argument than a language argument, but how do you address the fact that we will be interpreting essentially two statutes that are almost identical but with different conclusions if we were to adopt your view.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="473.622" stopTime="529.876">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="473.622" offset="2000396">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.055" offset="2002172">I think there are -- there are a few reasons why the statutes have to be construed differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.193" offset="2026727">I mean, one is that if you look at the Court's decision in Smith where it construed that provision of the Westfall Act, it -- the Court never suggested that the language -- the part of the Westfall Act whose language is the same as this supported its conclusion there.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.703" offset="2084719">It was relying on other provisions in the Westfall Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.821" offset="2097258">In particular there was a provision that said:</text>
            <text syncTime="501.507" offset="2111991">"Once the government substitutes itself for the defendant, the case shall proceed subject to all the exceptions and limitations in the Tort Claims Act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="508.196" offset="2138740">And the Court said: Well, yes, that gives us a clear understanding that, whether there's exceptions or not, we want that case to proceed -- to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.718" offset="2172804">That provision isn't here in the Gonzalez Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.586" offset="2184298">And there was another provision in the Westfall Act -- in the Smith case, in the Westfall Act that dealt with making a specific exception for Bivens cases and again that provision isn't here.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="529.876" offset="2225467">Why would Congress want to treat them differently?</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>

            <text syncTime="534.680" offset="2244693">I think the reason is when they were dealing in this case with this area in 1976 they were dealing with a specific problem of medical malpractice and they were looking at that problem, doctors, doctors had to get insurance, what are we going to do about that for Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.440" offset="2303730">And they -- when they focused on that problem, actually the Executive Branch itself said in a letter that was sent to the Senate committee, it said there's an urgent need both to assure adequate remedies for tort victims and to protect Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.632" offset="2364438">And that's what they were trying to do here and I think you see it throughout the Gonzalez Act.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="567.567" offset="2376246">But why did they feel the need here to assure adequate remedies for tort victims where they did not in the Westfall Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="576.090" offset="2410309">I mean, you know, injured tort victims are injured tort victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.475" offset="2423893">It does seem, you know, rather odd that in one instance Congress would be concerned and the other not concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.915" offset="2457643">I think the difference is that here they were dealing specifically with the problem of medical malpractice.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.099" offset="2474362">12 years later when they got around to the Westfall Act, they weren't looking at medical malpractice; they were looking generally at the whole problem of government employees being sued after this Court's decision in the Westfall case, a problem that particularly affected actually lower level government employees who it's clear couldn't take advantage of the discretionary function exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.346" offset="2551371">And when they are looking at the broad universe of employees, they took a different approach and decided, well, we're just going to -- some people are just going to be out of luck because this is the determination that Congress made, felt was appropriate there.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.504" offset="2599958">But when it was looking at the specific problem of medical malpractice in the Gonzalez Act, it definitely took the position, as everybody said at the time and as the structure of the Act itself showed, that they wanted to preserve remedies and there are two provisions in the Westfall Act that make that clear--</text>

            <text syncTime="677.472" offset="2815834">And when Congress was looking at the universe of Federal employees, they felt, and especially given the law at that time and that continued really up to the present, that when a Federal employee or average Federal employee for the types of intentional torts that they commit, especially a battery, it's extraordinarily unlikely that that's going to be within that scope of that employee's employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.119" offset="2898381">And Congress felt, well, we want to just eliminate that altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.821" offset="2913219">It's not just to hold the government responsible for that kind of a claim when some Federal clerk slugs someone or something like that, and that was the determination they made.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.260" offset="2946969">When they got around to 1976 to dealing with the particular problem of medical malpractice, it doesn't actually usually happen -- these kinds of claims don't arise -- I'm not aware of any where a doctor just grabs somebody and throws him physically into the operating room.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.703" offset="3004752">They happen when the doctor is performing some procedure and performs a different procedure or a procedure that was not authorized by the patient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1236.853" offset="5053379">Well, I can give you the answer that the government gave in its brief in Smith, which is the Gonzalez Act and the other four or five statutes continue to serve two, at least two vital functions, and one is specifically this, that they eliminate the intentional tort exception and, therefore, allow relief for victims of intentional tort in this medical malpractice context just like victims of other kinds of malpractice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.100" offset="5138329">The other thing is, there are some cases, for instance, foreign torts, where there is another provision of the Gonzalez Act, 1089(f), that provides for indemnifying or holding harmless doctors when judgments are against them in certain -- when there's a foreign tort, when a doctor has been detailed to a nonfederal agency, or if the circumstances are such as are likely to preclude a remedy under the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.500" offset="5251909">So again, Congress in that -- that provision remains important because there could be a foreign judgment against the doctor or something even after the Westfall Act and that gives the authority to reimburse the doctor if the agency determines that that's appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.927" offset="5305617">But that provision also shows that Congress intended that to preserve remedies here, because it would have made no sense for Congress to say, We want to provide for the indemnification or reimbursement of the doctor, if what they really were trying to do was eliminate all the cases against doctors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.322" offset="6495234">And let me talk about Dolan and the line of cases which recognizes a very narrow exception to the normal presumption against waivers of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.742" offset="6520938">Dolan and its predecessor cases recognize that the narrow exception to the canon when construing the scope of exceptions that were enacted alongside the broad waiver of sovereign immunity in the FTCA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.151" offset="6578512">And the purpose of drawing that exception to the canon was it didn't want -- the Court didn't want to defeat Congress's purpose as manifest in the broad waiver itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.007" offset="6618009">Those exceptions were cutting back on the contemporaneous waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.578" offset="6636295">The Court said, We don't want to cut back, given the uniquely broad waiver that the FTCA enacts, the narrow rule exception limited to those circumstances, that hasn't been applied outside those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.219" offset="6682793">Unlike those cases, this case is not construing the scope of an exception that was enacted alongside the FTCA that was trying to cut back on the waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.491" offset="6719887">To put it more concretely, on the day before the Gonzalez Act was enacted, there was no question that sovereign immunity barred the type of claim at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.594" offset="11256311">I think there are two potential reasons, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.846" offset="11265297">One might be the, as this Court has recognized, the special solicitude that Congress pays veterans, and it may have wanted to open up remedies to veterans that were unavailable to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.836" offset="11309287">I think the second potential reason is the defense side reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.688" offset="11320677">The defendants in Veterans Act cases are civilian Veterans Administration employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.140" offset="11338545">In a Gonzalez Act case, by and large the defendants are going to be active military personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.294" offset="11359129">Congress is often hesitant to create -- expand judicial remedies against active military personnel because of the risk it poses to interfering with military function and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.519" offset="11399985">So I think those are two reasons why Congress may have decided to change course in the Veterans Act in 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.673" offset="11428615">After it had four provisions that said exactly the same thing, using the four purposes of this Act provision, it changed it and it must have changed it for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.945" offset="11465709">Two potential reasons are to change the result, which of course under which the government would win; or, because it think -- it thought it needed to speak more clearly in order to waive sovereign immunity, and under the presumption against sovereign immunity waivers, the government would also prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2922.765" offset="11797046">However, other times when it uses for purposes of this section, even though it intends somewhat of a counterfactual inquiry, it eliminates those words.</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.720" offset="13356869">The government won summary judgment on that because there was no evidence, no expert testimony that supported Petitioner's claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3360.984" offset="13549862">This section, subsection (a), (b) and (c) all work in tandem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.437" offset="13567730">(D) is a settlement provision that really doesn't really have anything to do with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.556" offset="13580164">So when it says for purposes of this section, subsection (a) and this section are essentially the only operative provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.393" offset="13611511">The only other provisions that do any work are (e) and (f), which come after, obviously, subsection (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.780" offset="13633036">So when Congress used the term for purposes of this section, I think the fair statement is it was referring to subsections (a) through (c).</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="3390.920" offset="13669607">I just wanted to make a couple of quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.290" offset="13687057">One is, the Court has not applied the clear statement -- the unequivocal statement standard at any time in the Tort Claims Act, not just when it's dealing with exceptions, but if you go back to the very early cases, the Aetna case, the Yellow Cab case, really, right after the Act was passed, you can see that the Court is saying there, no, we want to interpret this Act consistent with Congress's intent, the way it wanted it interpreted, which is with a fair reading of its words, not in one direction, not in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.274" offset="13799070">I just also wanted to clarify in the Smith case, because of a possible misunderstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.713" offset="13828745">The Court definitely addressed the Gonzales Act repeatedly in its opinion in the Smith case, but it didn't -- the Court did not actually address 1089(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.217" offset="13858838">The reason the Government, though, this was important to the Government, and actually, the Government's reply brief in the Smith case was, I think, a hundred percent about the Gonzales Act, was that the other side of the Gonzales Act was saying, If you construe the Westfall Act the way the Government wants, that will be an implied repeal, but the Gonzales Act will have nothing left to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.828" offset="13929265">And it was important for the Government, that's why they kept saying it, it was important for the Government to say, No, the Gonzales Act does have things to do, this is not an implied repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.165" offset="13958626">And one of -- of the things it does is exactly what we say Section 1089(e) does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.350" offset="13975345">If there are no further questions?</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.802" offset="13985167">Mr. Feldman, the Court invited you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae, and you have ably discharged that responsibility, for which the Court is grateful.</text>
