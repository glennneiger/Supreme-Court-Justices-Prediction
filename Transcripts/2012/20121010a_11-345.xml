            <text syncTime="2371.050" offset="9590719">The other part of it is if you look at the admissions under the top 10 percent plan, taking the top 10 percent of a racially identifiable high school may get you diversity that looks okay on paper, but it doesn't guarantee you diversity that produces educational benefits on campus.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.910" offset="13842200">So my understanding of what the university here is looking to do, and what universities generally are looking to do in this circumstance, is not to grant a preference for privilege, but to make individualized decisions about applicants who will directly further the educational mission.</text>

            <text syncTime="4606.045" offset="18530761">But it's purely race, and it comes to the ultimate question then, which, Chief Justice, you were asking: Where is the end point?</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.966" offset="18558451">If you have nothing to gauge the success of the program, if you can't even say at the beginning we don't have critical mass because we don't know what it is and we refuse to say what it is, there is no judicial supervision, there is no strict scrutiny and there is no end point to what they are doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.142" offset="18619160">So what we have said, and it comes right back to Justice Breyer, how would you write it, you can clarify it, you can say Grutter properly applies, requires you to do A, B, C, and -- and we've said in our brief that would be satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.616" offset="18669001">But to the extent that you then have it surviving side by side, there could be enormous confusion.</text>
