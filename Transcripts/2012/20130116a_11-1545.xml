            <text syncTime="14.191" offset="163718">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.260" offset="168002">This case can get complicated quickly because the word “ jurisdiction ” means a lot of different things to a lot of different people in a lot of different contexts, and the parties have advanced both broad and narrow theories for resolving the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.067" offset="215231">So the thing I can do most helpfully at the beginning, I think, is to frame where I believe the real dispute in the case lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.554" offset="237174">The FCC claims the authority to interpret Section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act with the force of law, and my argument today is limited to the question -- that threshold jurisdictional question, which we call interpretive jurisdiction, Iowa Utilities called it underlying jurisdiction, law professors like to call it Chevron Step Zero, but that's what I'm focused on.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.551" offset="321184">And the Fifth Circuit said that on that question, the FCC gets Chevron deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.539" offset="345112">And that is, it gets to decide whether it has the authority to interpret--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="63.573" offset="361204">Mr. Goldstein, this case has been presented in a very complicated way, but it seems to me that what we're dealing with is a rule adopted by the Commission, and the Commission's rule-making power, as you know, is very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.201" offset="439780">They have power to make the rules needed to carry out the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.772" offset="462036">And 332 is -- counts as a provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.343" offset="484293">So why isn't it just a proper implementation of that rule-making authority?</text>

            <text syncTime="110.118" offset="547404">What the Fifth Circuit did, acknowledging a circuit conflict, was decided that the FCC's assertion that you are right is itself entitled to Chevron deference.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.830" offset="626294">But all the arguments that we hear still count against you.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.216" offset="639773">So if you want to go into the Chevron Step Zero or Step minus alpha 13.6, I mean, fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.887" offset="670493">But I mean, at some point, I will hope you -- I hope you will go into what I'd call the question of, we have a statute just as Justice Ginsburg said.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.993" offset="706856">It's an expert statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.945" offset="714693">It is a statute in an agency that has all kinds of discretionary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.647" offset="733501">It includes an important substantive question about what the relation is with the cable television in this area -- post -- not cable, but, you know, the broadcast posts.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.289" offset="780103">And so all these factors here which suggest, of course, Congress, which is not expert, would have wanted the FCC to figure this one out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.955" offset="6686702">And you go along, but then all of a sudden in, you know, section 123 it says it doesn't get any deference interpreting this provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.734" offset="6753889">And as I understand the case, and that's why I persist in thinking there's no great disagreement here, your friend on the other side is saying that, particularly given 7(a) and some other things, you should read 7(b)(2) as if Congress had said: Agency, you don't get any deference here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.445" offset="6832675">You can read it that way, they say, because 7(a) says nothing shall limit what the State can do other than what's here in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.051" offset="6863081">And if you let the FCC, if you give them deference, you're letting something else limit what the State can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.621" offset="6885442">So why -- and then you dispute, it seems to me, just whether that you should call that jurisdiction or not, because people think of jurisdiction as meaning, oh, you don't get through the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.894" offset="6926507">But if what they mean by jurisdiction is simply that the agency gets no deference on this point, then it seems to me everybody's saying the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.132" offset="7155444">But if there is ambiguity on the first, our position is that Chevron applies and that the agency gets deference so long as it's a permissible construction of the statute, and that's true whether you call it jurisdiction or whether you call it substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.442" offset="7220645">And one reason for that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that I don't think there is -- I do think this is really a Pandora's box situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.465" offset="7248753">I do not think there is a clear, neat dividing line between what my friend, Mr. Goldstein, describes as a jurisdictional issue, an issue of interpretive authority, and a question of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.420" offset="7288564">And I think you can see that in the briefing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.272" offset="7300058">Mr. Goldstein has tried to define jurisdiction in a particular way; the IMLA has defined it in a very different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.842" offset="7322314">They say any question that goes to the who, what, when or where of an agency's assertion of authority is a jurisdictional question, as to which agencies get no Chevron deference in the course of ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.067" offset="7367244">And the reason that IMLA gives for stating that position is exactly the same reason that Mr. Goldstein gives for stating his position, which is that you're talking about an agency action in excess of the scope of its delegated authority and once you say that, there's no Chevron deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.176" offset="7427640">And I would respectfully submit once you have got a situation in which it is clear that the agency has general authority to implement and the argument is whether its authority to implement has, with respect to a particular provision, has been carved out, at that point Chevron deference is appropriate, and that is the practice of this Court in repeated numbers of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.573" offset="7509246">American Hospital Association is certainly one such case where the -- the NLRB had general rulemaking authority, there was a statutory provision that said bargaining units needed to be determined by the NLRB in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.065" offset="7563163">And the argument was made that that ought to be understood as a carveout from the NLRB's general authority requiring case-by-case decisionmaking with respect to bargaining units, and the Court rejected that argument, saying that -- that in that case, whatever ambiguity there was in the statute ought to be resolved under Chevron in favor of the agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1913.497" offset="7760962">Here's our answer to the question presented, Justice Sotomayor: That there is de novo review of the question of whether Congress has delegated authority to the agency generally to act with the force of law and whether the interpretation claiming deference is an exercise of that delegated authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.225" offset="7839852">Once that is satisfied under de novo review, Chevron kicks in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.796" offset="7862108">Now, Step 1 of Chevron is, of course, de novo review using the normal tools of statutory construction to answer the question whether Congress has spoken clearly on the issue of whether the agency has authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.205" offset="7919787">If the answer is that Congress has, then that disposes of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1992.148" offset="8075476">--Louisiana Public Service Commission, a little bit of confusion I think about that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.686" offset="8101703">That case was decided in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.119" offset="8111421">Congress added the sections Mr. Goldstein referred to, 251 and 252 of the Communications Act, in 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.459" offset="8140782">And what Louisiana Public Service Commission did was define the outer limits of the commission's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.113" offset="8163352">It said nothing shall be -- nothing in this act shall give or -- shall be construed to give the commission authority or jurisdiction over intrastate communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.302" offset="8204103">So it was an express carveout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.754" offset="8209955">That seems to me, had you had run that through the Chevron analysis, it'd be a pretty straightforward Chevron Step 1 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.241" offset="8231898">Adams Fruit, the Court held specifically in Adams Fruit that the plain meaning of the statutory provision at issue foreclosed the agency's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.298" offset="8280172">And that's at 494 U.S. at page 646.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.584" offset="8293233">So that was a Chevron Step One case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.317" offset="8300234">It then did go on to say, with respect to Chevron Step Two, that even if we were going to think about granting the agency deference here, they wouldn't get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.006" offset="8339000">But I think the reasons -- if you map the reasoning of Adams Fruit onto this case, it supports our position and not Mr. Goldstein's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.993" offset="8362928">What the Court said in Adams Fruit was that the Department of Labor did have the authority to implement the substantive provisions of the Agricultural Workers Protection Act, including the substantive provisions governing motor vehicle safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.650" offset="8417576">What it didn't have was the authority to restrict judicial remedies available for the private cause of action created under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.656" offset="8449550">Well, if you map that onto here, what the FCC has done here with respect to the reasonable time provision in 332(c)(7)(B) of the statute was to provide a rule of decision for the substantive provision of the Act, leaving to the courts the decision of what remedy, if any, there would be for a violation of those substantive provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.170" offset="8531574">And so it's -- it totally maps onto -- to the FCC's interpretation of the right way to think about statutory authority in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.259" offset="8559996">And if I -- I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2115.109" offset="8567414">Well, what worries me about it is you and I both have in our offices thousands of words which are in the U.S. Code and there are hundreds of thousands -- or millions of employees in millions of different kinds of agencies, and if we turn Chevron into the tax code, it's going to be a nightmare -- in my opinion, not necessarily in that of my colleagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.243" offset="8671904">So as you know, I've written somewhat a different approach, and it says, Let's not do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.647" offset="8697504">But just so, who would win here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.147" offset="8703564">Suppose you just said, Look, what we're interested in is just one question, whether Congress wanted a court to give, in this kind of situation, deference to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.537" offset="8745047">And the answer will be, It depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.406" offset="8760511">Chevron is a good rule of thumb, but it isn't a straightjacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.458" offset="8772737">So what you'd look at here is it's the FCC that is in charge of national communications, of which this is part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.695" offset="8801680">There is a specific provision, as your colleague points out, that says</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.666" offset="8821638">"but don't interfere with the States when they are citing stuff. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.118" offset="8831356">But then there is a limitation to that specific provision which consists of six or seven parts, all of which maintain a lot of authority in the FCC or rules about what they are not supposed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.657" offset="8873569">And then here it uses the word “ reasonable ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.009" offset="8882973">So where you have a federal agency with expertise that's in charge of this kind of area and they have rule-making authority and you have a statute like this, which is a little bit ambiguous, but not too, in respect to the point about whether they do interpretation, you'd add up those factors and make a decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3534.231" offset="14243822">It had no difficulty identifying that as a separate inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.266" offset="14255943">I did want to just turn to the merits--</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.535" offset="14265034">Let me just say that the Solicitor General's argument about whether the 201(b) authority extends to 332(c)(7) is a great illustration of our argument on the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.925" offset="14306621">Because that's a lawyer's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.709" offset="14313726">There was not a word that my friend said about there was a technical question of communications law and how wireless citing facilities operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.281" offset="14344028">That's the kind of question that Congress gives to agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.750" offset="14357925">It is not the threshold lawyer's issue, does this statute read this far?</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.221" offset="14375793">I would only encourage you on the merits question, which is not included in the question presented, which you didn't grant certiorari on, that is, the application of de novo review to this statute to pay more attention than I think this argument has given it, because it wasn't the core issue briefed in the case, obviously, to what Congress did in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.099" offset="14447369">There was a version of the statute that gave the FCC the very authority that it is claiming here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.235" offset="14467849">That was the House version of the bill that was rejected in Congress in conference, Congress adopted this version, ordered the FCC to cancel the rule-making and reserve this power to the courts, the -- the authority to decide what is a reasonable period of time.</text>
