            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">Justice Kennedy has our opinion this morning in Case 11-345, Fisher versus University of Texas.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="7.228" stopTime="370.776">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.228" offset="136359">The University of Texas at Austin which is the principal campus which is the principal campus of the university has committed itself to increasing racial minority enrollment on campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.961" offset="175334">The university considers race as one of the various factors in its undergraduate admissions process.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.513" offset="201561">And the petitioner, who is a Caucasian, sued the university after her application was rejected and she contends the university's use of race in the admission process violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.844" offset="250880">Both parties move for summary judgment, the District Court granted summary judgment to the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.943" offset="271256">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.816" offset="282749">It held that courts must give substantial deference to the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.916" offset="299154">It -- it held that deference must be given both in the definition of the compelling interest in diversity's benefits and in deciding whether the specific plan was narrowly tailored to achieve its stated goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.691" offset="366237">And applying that standard, the Court upheld the university's admissions plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.691" offset="390269">Now, among the Court's cases involving racial classifications in education, there are three decisions that are of particular relevance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.921" offset="419109">These are the Regents of the University of California versus Bakke, Gratz versus Bollinger, and Grutter versus Bollinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.992" offset="451396">In the Bakke case, the opinion refers to the concurring opinion by Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.683" offset="478250">And we take these precedents as -- as given for the purposes of deciding today's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.991" offset="503432">Grutter endorsed Justice Powell's conclusion in Bakke.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.483" offset="517433">The conclusion was that the attainment of a diverse student body is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.244" offset="552438">Grutter also made clear that racial classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored to further compelling governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.535" offset="593607">Thus, under Grutter, strict scrutiny must be applied to any admissions program that uses racial classifications or racial categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.565" offset="629760">Grutter concluded that the decision to pursue the educational benefits that flow from student body diversity is an academic judgment to which some, but not complete, judicial deference is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.203" offset="676258">The Court of course should ensure that there is a reasoned, principled explanation for that academic decision and a university is not permitted to define diversity as some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of that group's race -- racial or ethnic origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.433" offset="757238">That would amount to outright racial balancing which is patently unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.947" offset="779285">On this point, in today's case, the District Court and the Court of Appeals were correct in finding that Grutter calls for some deference to the university's experience and expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.673" offset="818155">Now, once the university has established that its goal of diversity is consistent with strict scrutiny, there still must be a further judicial determination that the means chosen by the university to obtain diversity are narrowly tailored to that goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.725" offset="878341">And on this point, the university receives no deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.797" offset="894642">As The Court said in Grutter, it remains at all times the university's obligation to demonstrate and the judiciary's obligation to determine that the admissions processes ensure that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicant's race -- race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.005" offset="983458">Narrow tailoring also requires that the reviewing court verify that it is necessary for a university to use race to achieve the educational benefits of diversity, and this involves a careful judicial inquiry into whether a university could achieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.763" offset="1050540">And the opinion today sets forth in more detail the strict scrutiny process that courts must undertake in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.136" offset="1083977">Rather than perform a searching examination that is required, however, here, the Court of Appeals held petitioner could challenge only “whether the university's decision to reintroduce race as a factor in admissions was made in good faith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="259.988" offset="1147402">It held that in considering that challenge, the Court would presume the university acted in good faith and placed on petitioner the burden of rebutting that presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.257" offset="1188467">The expression of the controlling standard of strict scrutiny by the Court of Appeals in this case is at odds with Grutter's command that all racial classifications imposed by government must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.430" offset="1237159">Gutter did -- Grutter did not hold that good faith would get -- would forgive an impermissible consideration of race and the higher education dynamic does not change the narrow tailoring analysis of strict scrutiny applicable in other contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.036" offset="1299644">Strict scrutiny must not be strict in theory but fatal in fact, but the opposite is also true.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.530" offset="1321587">Strict scrutiny must not be strict in theory but feeble in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.306" offset="1336738">In order for judicial review to be meaningful, a university must make a showing that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve the only interest that this Court has approved in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.685" offset="1374250">The benefits of a student body diversity that encompasses a broad array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.524" offset="1417613">The District Court and the Court of Appeals confined the strict scrutiny inquiry in too narrow a way by deferring to the university's good faith in its use of racial classification and this Court now vacates that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.834" offset="1470798">Fairness to the litigants and to the courts that heard the case requires that the matter be remanded so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.448" offset="1509251">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.306" offset="1532656">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.968" offset="1543314">Justice Thomas has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.512" offset="1553554">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.680" offset="1566198">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
