            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Alito has our opinion this morning in case 11-556, Vance versus Ball State University.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="7.958" stopTime="401.256">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="7.958" offset="138261">This case requires us to explain what we meant into 1998 decisions concerning employer liability for workplace harassment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.818" offset="197716">In those two cases, Burlington Industries versus Ellerth and Faragher versus Boca Raton, the Court held that somewhat different rules applied depending on whether the employee accused of harassment is a supervisor or simply a co-worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.606" offset="264903">This difference comes into play in those cases in which no tangible employment action such as termination or denial of promotion took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.773" offset="305549">In these cases, if the alleged harasser was merely a co-worker, the plaintiff must show that the employer was negligent in allowing the harassment to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.547" offset="344628">But if the alleged harasser was a supervisor, the employer must show that it exercised reasonable care and that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to take advantage of opportunities to prevent or stop the harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.003" offset="402411">While Ellerth and Faragher established a special rule for cases involving harassment by a supervisor, they did not define what they meant by the term “Supervisor” and that is the question that we answer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.513" offset="460507">The lower courts have grappled with this question for some time and two competing definitions have emerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.867" offset="489869">This case is from the Seventh Circuit and under the definition adopted by that Court and some others, a supervisor is a person who has the authority to take a tangible employment action, the term I used later -- I used earlier, to hire, fire, promote, or take some other action having economic consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.027" offset="570535">Under the alternative interpretation which is favored by the EEOC, supervisor status depends on a weighing of a number of factors, several of which are quite vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.580" offset="620795">According to that alternative, a supervisor must have sufficient authority over the victim, must exercise that authority more than occasionally, and must do so with respect to more than a limited number of tasks.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.255" offset="687459">All of these key terms are hard to pin down.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.669" offset="701147">Petitioner in this case was employed in Ball State University's Banquet and Catering Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.637" offset="728942">She sued Ball State alleging that a fellow employee, Davis, harassed her because of her race. She claims that Davis “gave her a hard time by doing such things as glaring at her, slamming pots and pants around her, giving her weird looks, and blocking the entrance to an elevator.”</text>
            <text syncTime="174.827" offset="805742">The District Court held that Ball State was not vicariously liable because the alleged harasser, who could not take tangible employment actions against Vance, was not a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.673" offset="857151">The Seventh Circuit affirmed and we now hold that the Seventh Circuit applied the correct definition of a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.364" offset="887871">Ellerth and Faragher adapted a framework that draws a sharp line between supervisors and co-workers, and the Seventh Circuit's clear definition of a supervisor fits best within this highly structured framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.066" offset="946698">Perhaps, the greatest advantage of this approach is that it permits harassment cases to be litigated in an orderly and understandable way, and this serves the best interest of all concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.871" offset="997898">Under our approach, the status of an alleged harasser will often be obvious before the litigation even begins, and it is likely to be resolved as a matter of law before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.640" offset="1045023">This permits the parties to formulate a single coherent theory to be presented to the jury and it simplifies the task of juries which are already required to grapple with complex, instructions, and employment discrimination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.607" offset="1104896">A jury that understands the law that it has to apply is more likely to return a fair verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.726" offset="1133317">By contrast, the alternative definition of a supervisor is a study in ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.387" offset="1155992">And as a result of this ambiguity, the status of an alleged harasser would often remain unresolved throughout the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.524" offset="1188592">The parties would have to present their cases under two separate legal frameworks and the job of the jury would be greatly complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.442" offset="1220253">Contrary to the dissent, the approach that we adopt will not thwart recovery for workplace harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.933" offset="1246166">Two major points should be kept in mind: First, regardless of whether an alleged harasser is classified as a supervisor or a co-worker, a harassment victim may always recover by proving that the employer was negligent in allowing the harassment to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.173" offset="1315129">There is nothing unusual or particularly onerous about this requirement.It is very common in the law of torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.063" offset="1346685">And the different between or the plaintiff must show in a co-worker case, as opposed to a supervisor case, should not be exaggerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.973" offset="1378346">Perhaps, the biggest difference is the party who wins if the Jury thinks that the evidence favoring the plaintiff and the evidence favoring the defense are exactly equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.613" offset="1420873">In all other cases where the evidence taps -- tips even slightly in one direction or the other, the allocation of the burden of persuasion makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.590" offset="1460788">Second, the rule that we adopt today is neither new, nor untested.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.482" offset="1480328">The dissenting opinion recounts the allegations or evidence of harassment in a number of shocking cases and intimates that our holding would thwart recovery in such cases, but that charges is unfounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.037" offset="1530587">The rule that we adopt has been the law for some time in the First, Seventh, and Eight Circuits which together cover Fourteen Jurisdictions: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island, Illinois, Puerto Rico, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and North and South Dakota and Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.716" offset="1609268">We are aware of no evidence that this rule has left harassment victims unprotected in say, Boston or Chicago or Minneapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.798" offset="1645631">For these reasons, the decision of the Seventh Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.535" offset="1660573">Justice Thomas has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.792" offset="1673634">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan have joined.</text>
