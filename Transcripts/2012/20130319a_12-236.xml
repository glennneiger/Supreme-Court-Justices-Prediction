            <text syncTime="7.437" offset="135641">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.939" offset="145672">The Vaccine Act does not provide for an award of attorneys' fees on a petition that is denied as untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.693" offset="172735">That's the best reading of the Act's text, it fits best with the structure and purposes of the Act, and it's the result that's consistent with the canons of construction that would apply to an award of attorneys' fees out of the Federal Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.900" offset="217561">Now, the -- the textual question here in some sense begins with the statute of limitations, which is in Section 16 the Act, and which provides that no petition may be filed outside the applicable time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.208" offset="266776">Now, that provision, like most limitations provisions, doesn't itself actually say what the consequences of the failure to comply with the provision are.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.331" offset="303243">And in some sense, just as in the -- the civil context, it's not as if the Special Master, upon finding the limitations provision hasn't been complied with, can go back in time and prevent the petition from being filed, just as a civil court can't prevent an action from being commenced, or a suit from being brought, or whatever the limitations provision proscribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.410" offset="387566">So the question really is going forward, what -- what consequences should there be once the adjudicator decides -- once he or the Special Master decides -- that the limitations period has not been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.868" offset="433437">And textually speaking, it's the correspondence between the limitations provision, which says that no petition may be filed, and the attorneys' fee provision, which depends on the existence of a petition filed, that signals that Congress intended the consequences of untimeliness to be visited through the application of the attorneys' fees provision--</text>

            <text syncTime="112.339" offset="555272">For example, reporting annually to Congress, publishing a notice in the Federal Register, those both refer to any petition filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.314" offset="603128">And so in those sections at least, petition filed would assume petition filed after the running of the statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.214" offset="718799">That's generally true, certainly in the civil context, that we accept the plaintiff's allegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.945" offset="897685">--Well, it -- they -- they have historically, and let me -- up till about 2009 -- and again, to be clear, they're taking steps to rectify that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.218" offset="934779">But with respect to the period up to 2009, what they would do -- and this is understandable given the provision that says it's supposed to be published within -- and I believe it's 30 days, that they -- the petitions that are received or that were received at the Department get logged into a computer database, and then a report gets printed out, and they would cross-check them for accuracy against the petition title and forward them to the Office of the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.285" offset="1043030">Not -- it doesn't -- it wouldn't make sense in a provision that's supposed to be applied essentially upon the filing of the petition, to go into an examination of the timeliness of that -- of that petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.776" offset="1092977">And so we think that provision, just as you would -- just as you would describe in a civil context, you would certainly say that an action that ultimately proves to be held untimely would nonetheless commence if -- for example, if you imagine a statute of limitations that says no action may be commenced, you wouldn't say the action hadn't been commenced at the time it was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.773" offset="1176986">And -- and that's not the argument we're relying on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.993" offset="1193914">What -- rather, what we're relying on is the fact that when you get to the end of the case, which is where the attorneys' fee provision is evidently supposed to apply--</text>

            <text syncTime="288.420" offset="1259638">So do -- does the Department subtract the number of untimely petitions from the number that it reports?</text>

            <text syncTime="402.462" offset="1715736">And that's because the -- the attorneys' fee provision speaks as of -- it speaks of awards of fees at the time of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.168" offset="1754606">And so at that time, we know that any limitations issue should have been resolved by that point in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.638" offset="1780415">And therefore, it is -- it is an entirely natural -- it's entirely natural to expect that the limitations provision might therefore have some consequences at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.212" offset="1826808">In some ways, you can think of it as an application of the old maxim that equity regards as done what ought to have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.099" offset="1850319">So we're saying to the Special Master, well, if you've gotten to the point at the end of the case where there's a judgment, and you've determined that this petition was forbidden from being filed, in the sense that the limitations provision forbids it, then you should visit the consequences there.</text>

            <text syncTime="850.155" offset="3506586">Well, I think viewing the word “ filed ” in this way also explains mechanically why the limitations issue becomes an affirmative defense on the merits as well, because Section 13 says compensation has to be awarded on a record, and the record is defined as the record on a petition filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.283" offset="3583073">So similarly, if you get to the end of the case or you get to the point of limitations determination, the court says, well, there shouldn't -- there shouldn't be -- there should not have been a petition here, and so regarding -- regarding is done what should have been done, we'll say there is no -- there is no record available on that petition, so we should deny compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1034.008" offset="4241986">The second is a case in which there is a question about when the statute of limitations begins to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.244" offset="4266854">And one of the points at which it can begin to run is when there is the onset of significant aggravation of an injury, which seems like a question about which there could be a factual dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.236" offset="4314815">And in that situation as well, the claimant does not prevail on the statute of limitations argument, but there was a reasonable basis for thinking that the petition was submitted within the period after the -- the onset of this significant aggravation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.229" offset="4374792">Why would Congress want to draw a line between -- a distinction between those two situations for the purpose of attorneys' fees?</text>

            <text syncTime="1074.752" offset="4404885">Well, there's several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.985" offset="4409901">The first -- the first one is that in your -- in your first example where there's been a determination on the merits, the Special Master is in a perfect situation to decide whether there was a reasonable basis on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.225" offset="4454831">And this is how -- this is how the program has worked since its existence, because to be clear, until the decision below, there was no practice of awarding attorneys' fees on untimely petitions in the -- in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.450" offset="4499762">And so what you would get would be situations like your first example, Justice Alito, where the Special Master would issue a -- a written decision on entitlement and these are -- these are 10, 15, 20, 25 pages long in my experience, dealing in considerable detail with the medical evidence, the scientific evidence, the expert testimony, the review of literature, the different theories of causation, and getting to the end, and obviously, if a decision is that compensation is to be awarded, then attorneys' fees follow as a matter of right, but if compensation is denied, the Special Master can and typically does add literally as an afterthought that -- but having been through all of this and having discussed all of this, I think there was a reasonable basis for what was being argued here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.127" offset="4670394">Now, in your second example where the Special Master has only determined this essentially diagnostic question of when was the first symptom of this particular claimant's particular injury, the Special Master hasn't looked at any materials about whether the vaccine can cause that injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.440" offset="4747716">So let me give as a -- as a paradigm example maybe the -- what we give in our brief as the -- the Smith case which had to do with the claim of whether certain childhood vaccines caused the claimant's Type 1 diabetes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.248" offset="4794946">And the Special Master's decision focuses on the question of whether the first symptom of the diabetes was a blood glucose reading that sent the claimant to the hospital, and then--</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.293" offset="4875089">You seem to be assuming that the attorneys' fee award on good faith basis has to do with the ultimate merits, did the vaccine cause this injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.600" offset="4920333">I would have assumed that the award of attorneys' fees has to do with whether the petition was brought in good faith; i.e., was there a reasonable basis to believe that the petition was timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.610" offset="4972369">And on that issue, before the Court can adjudicate the timeliness question, it has to know all of the facts that made the petitioner believe it was timely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.877" offset="6405447">My friend started with Section 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.710" offset="6416732">I'd like to start very briefly with our reading of the fee provision itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.447" offset="6431674">Section 15(e)(1), which says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.733" offset="6444839">"Any petition filed under Section 11 is eligible for award of attorneys' fees, even if it's denied, provided that two conditions are satisfied. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1598.291" offset="6499070">15(e) itself and by its terms says nothing about compliance with the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.028" offset="6522057">The filing provisions of Section 11, which are Section 11(a)(1) similarly say nothing about compliance with the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.252" offset="6558942">Our position, therefore, is the most direct and sensible reading of 15(e)(1) is you can get an award of fees on a petition that has been denied regardless of the reason why, and there is no textual basis for saying that that provision carves out an exception for one class of denied cases, those denied on limitations grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2709.999" offset="10945946">The -- I was not aware of the fact that the Secretary no longer discharges her obligation to publish in the Federal Register, but as we noted in our brief, our petition was published.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.105" offset="10986384">And her obligation to publish it was triggered by the statute's requirement that a petition has, quote, “ been filed under Section 11 ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.961" offset="11017731">Ours -- ours, in fact, was published.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.497" offset="11027866">The question that -- that you raised, Justice Kagan, is there any other situation where this reading results in a petition that has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.507" offset="11083977">The answer is yes, the Government argues that a petition filed under Section 11, even if it's untimely, is sufficient to commence proceedings and confer jurisdiction, which if that's true, it goes to your question, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.068" offset="11162136">How do you get here if the statute -- if the statute of limitations is not jurisdictional?</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.205" offset="11182720">How do you get from one place to the next?</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.657" offset="11196513">I -- I think there's not a good answer for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.459" offset="11211768">Another question that has arisen, I think, Justice Scalia, your comments are correct, that -- that a filing, a judgment can occur at any time in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.701" offset="11260670">I think it's also important to remember that the Secretary is not bound to defend a case on the merits and then contest a fee award for the same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.343" offset="11307272">So there are cases pending before the Special Masters right now that for reasons I suspect are that the Secretary wanted to establish a precedent, that there is no causation between vaccine A and injury X, we want to litigate that on the merits, and they have won.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.471" offset="11379788">But it wasn't a slam dunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.023" offset="11393999">There was a lot of evidence and a lot of science to contradict that, which was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.209" offset="11410717">Those lawyers now come before the Special Master and seek fees in those cases, and the Secretary is arguing no fees because these are time-barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.866" offset="11453349">And in that case, you are going to have a judgment, by the Government's account, entered on the merits and then they're going to come back and defend a fee award saying, there is no judgment because there's never been a case filed, and you can't get fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.911" offset="11521581">And it is just a fundamental and glaring inconsistency with their position.</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.312" offset="13167190">--Well, no, we don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.331" offset="13175236">And actually, that's the point I wanted to start with is that -- is that the Federal Circuit's decision below puts the program into this unchartered territory, where we don't really know what this is going to look like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.520" offset="13215987">The cases that -- that my friend cites in his brief are ones that either the petition is so facially defective that, of course, fees can't be awarded on it, but there's no reason to think that's going to be the typical case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.744" offset="13264888">And then there's other cases where the application of the reasonable basis standard is so lax as to essentially just turn on -- on the claimant's personal say-so, that, oh, I think the vaccine caused my injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.521" offset="13319955">That's like -- that's the Hamrick case, for example; it's cited in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.373" offset="13331448">And that -- that can't be the standard for reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.325" offset="13343256">And -- and so I think the Court needs to keep in mind that, for example, when my friend says there's -- the government doesn't cite a case where there's been any shadow trial, the reason is because there haven't been fees available on untimely petitions, which is exactly the set-up that would cause you to have a shadow trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3331.588" offset="13432281">Well, there aren't -- there are not really other procedural grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.475" offset="13447850">There may be situations where a petition is voluntarily withdrawn, and I think there is a problem there about there not actually being a judgment when somebody voluntarily withdraws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.831" offset="13485257">But even in those, the Special Masters should have, in our view, examined whether there was a reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.568" offset="13512216">I don't think it's right to say that an attorney can come in, file the petition and then the claimant decides, well, I would like to withdraw, and then the attorney essentially gets paid as of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.274" offset="13547011">So our -- it's unsurprising that there's no examples of these hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.427" offset="13567595">It's also unsurprising that my friend says, well, there -- for the petitions, when it comes time to determine fees, the record is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.200" offset="13606675">Of course the record is complete, because the case has been decided on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.819" offset="13621199">And that's the paradigm situation under which the program has been operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.039" offset="13634051">What we are talking about here is entering this unchartered territory, where -- where the program has not been before, and where you wouldn't think Congress would want to send it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.943" offset="13665711">And this is our central concern with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.145" offset="13674488">The government's concern here -- and the reason we've petitioned for certiorari is not because of the dollar amount involved in paying these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.834" offset="13705208">The concern is about where the program's resources are being directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.202" offset="13722763">The question is -- the question is about where the finite number of Special Masters, the finite number of government attorneys, can put their time in responding to these petitions for -- to deliver the compensation to the very few but very deserving people who Congress wanted to award compensation to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.581" offset="13792248">And our concern here is--</text>

            <text syncTime="3423.800" offset="13801130">No attorneys' fees when the client dies, or they decide to withdraw the petition when it's dismissed early on for a procedural ground, when the record is inadequate, et cetera.</text>
