            <text syncTime="237.420" offset="1056116">Mr. Bowman went to a grain elevator and he bought from the grain elevator without restriction seeds to -- with his purpose to plant them.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.918" offset="1138141">Let's take for example Claim 130 which is at supplemental appendix 19, that is a method for selectively controlling weeds in a field.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.101" offset="1250885">Now, if you say that there is exhaustion in the seeds that Mr. Bowman purchased from the grain elevator but you say it doesn't apply to the progeny, you are not allowing him to actually practice the invention to grow more seeds.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.829" offset="1421726">So, we are talking here -- he can do what he wants with the first generation.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.966" offset="1450356">And moreover, when he buys them from Monsanto, he can make new seeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.754" offset="1473449">He can make generation two, because they've licensed him to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.706" offset="1485256">Here, he buys generation two.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.258" offset="1499466">Now, he can do what he wants with those seeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.778" offset="1513573">But I'll tell you, there is a problem, because the coming about of the third generation is itself the infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.584" offset="1556831">So the second generation seeds have nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.786" offset="1569579">If he went into a room and had a box that he bought from a lab and he put rocks in it and he said, hocus-pocus and lo and behold out came the third generation of seeds, he would have infringed Monsanto's patent with that third generation, would he not?</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.454" offset="4888280">And you said, well, they can protect themselves by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.341" offset="4903849">Actually, it seems to me that that answer is purely insufficient in this kind of a case, because all that has to happen is that one seed escapes the web of these contracts, and that seed, because it can self-replicate in the way that it can, essentially makes all the contracts worthless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.502" offset="4984515">So again, we are back to the Chief Justice's problem, that Monsanto would have no incentive to create a product like this one.</text>

            <label>Ms. Melissa Arbus Sherry</label>
            <text syncTime="1529.454" offset="6224286">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.606" offset="6240900">I'd like to start by talking about this Court's decision in J.E.M., because I think it largely resolves this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.743" offset="6265455">J.E.M. was a patent case, and the issue there was whether or not you could get a utility patent on a plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.164" offset="6291160">The argument was that you couldn't get a utility patent because the Plant Variety Protection Act implicitly repealed the Patent Act in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.435" offset="6324178">This Court rejected that argument, and the reason it rejected that argument was because it found no conflict between the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.691" offset="6353226">The reason it found no conflict between the two statutes is because it said that it is harder to get a utility patent, and for that reason, you get greater protection -- under the Patent Act, you get greater rights of exclusion under the Patent Act than you do under the PVPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.618" offset="6416965">And it said, most notably, there is no seed saving exemption in the Patent Act, there is no research exemption in the Patent Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.041" offset="6446640">The consequence of Petitioner's argument would be that this Court would not only be reading a seed-saving exemption into the Patent Act, and a research exemption, it would be doing much, much, much more under the guise of patent exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.614" offset="6496900">Justice Breyer, as you pointed out, the Exhaustion Doctrine really has nothing to do with this case, and that's because the Exhaustion Doctrine has always been limited to the particular article that was sold, and we are talking about a different article here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.339" offset="6543816">And it's never extended to the making of a new article.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="1612.624" stopTime="1639.875">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1612.624" offset="6556982">Well, but I mean, this -- the reason it's never is because this is an entirely different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.326" offset="6571715">It's the reason it's here, because you have the intersection of the Exhaustion Doctrine and the -- the normal protection of reinvented articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.099" offset="6606823">So I don't think it gets you very far to say that we've never applied the Exhaustion Doctrine that way either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.436" offset="6632214">We have never applied the reinvention doctrine to articles that reinvent themselves like plant seed.</text>

            <label>Ms. Melissa Arbus Sherry</label>
            <text syncTime="1639.875" offset="6665964">It's true that the Court hasn't had an exhaustion case specifically involving the sort of replicating technology, but when the Court has talked about exhaustion it has always focused on the specific article that's sold and it has done that for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.368" offset="6719881">The concept underlying exhaustion is that when the patentholder controls that very first sale it gets the one royalty with respect to the actual article sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.974" offset="6758333">Petitioner's argument isn't limited to the commodity grain that we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.543" offset="6776619">It's not even limited -- when you talk -- Justice Breyer, you mentioned the three different generations of seeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.163" offset="6795114">There is actually quite a few more generations than those three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.299" offset="6807653">If the concept is the sale of a parent plant exhausts the patentholder's rights not only with respect to that seed but with respect to all the progeny seed, we would have to go all the way back to the very first Roundup Ready plant that was created as part of the transformation event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.743" offset="6873481">Every single Roundup Ready seed in existence today is the progeny of that one parent plant and, as Your Honor pointed out, that would eviscerate patent protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.349" offset="6911829">There would be no incentive to invest, not just in Roundup Ready soybeans or not even agricultural technology, but it's quite a bit broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.855" offset="6945893">In order to encourage investment, the Patent Act provides 20 years of exclusivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.341" offset="6967835">This would be reducing the 20-year term to essentially one and only sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.910" offset="6986121">It would be near impossible to recoup your investments with that first sale and so the more likely consequence is that research dollars would be put elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.599" offset="7020812">The other--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1731.451" offset="7032306">That's a pretty horrible result, but let me give you another horrible result, and that is if -- if we agree with you, farmers will not be able to do a second planting by simply getting the undifferentiated seeds from a grain elevator, because at least a few of those seeds will always be patented seeds, and no farmer could ever plant anything from a grain elevator, which means -- I gather they use it for second plantings where the risks are so high that it doesn't pay to buy expensive seed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.778" offset="7197609">Now they can't do that any more because there's practically no grain elevator that doesn't have at least one patented seed in it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="melissa_arbus_sherry" startTime="1781.048" stopTime="1823.727">
            <label>Ms. Melissa Arbus Sherry</label>
            <text syncTime="1781.048" offset="7230627">--And the answer to that is this is actually not a traditional farming practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.002" offset="7246510">Despite what Petitioner says, farmers do not generally go to grain elevators, buy commingled grain, plant it in the ground as seed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.525" offset="7280573">If you look at the American Soybean Association brief submitted on behalf of soybean farmers, it says as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.926" offset="7302203">If you look at the CHS brief which is submitted on behalf of grain elevators, it also explains that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.163" offset="7323101">And there is a number of reasons why that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.349" offset="7331878">There's the reasons that Petitioner talked about, which is that they an undifferentiated mix, but there are other reasons as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.086" offset="7354761">The business of grain elevators is not to sell commingled grain as seed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.473" offset="7376391">If that was their business they would have to comply with seed labeling laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.192" offset="7391228">They do not do so because it's not their business model.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="1823.727" stopTime="1830.731">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1823.727" offset="7401364">That's why it's so cheap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.211" offset="7407320">And that's why farmers -- and that's why farmers want to use it, for a cheap planting.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="melissa_arbus_sherry" startTime="1830.731" stopTime="1838.487">
            <label>Ms. Melissa Arbus Sherry</label>
            <text syncTime="1830.731" offset="7429367">But farmers wouldn't be able to use it for another reason as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.250" offset="7439502">Even if you take patent law and you put it entirely to the side, there is still the Plant Variety Protection Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="1838.486" stopTime="1841.938">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="1838.486" offset="7460400">But correct me if I am wrong; I thought that is what Bowman did.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="melissa_arbus_sherry" startTime="1841.938" stopTime="1896.207">
            <label>Ms. Melissa Arbus Sherry</label>
            <text syncTime="1841.938" offset="7474193">Bowman did, absolutely did it in this circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.324" offset="7487777">But Bowman also said that he is not aware of other farmers who are engaging in this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.028" offset="7506585">And again, there is another reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.344" offset="7511809">Putting aside the labeling laws, there is the Plant Variety Protection Act and, as Pioneer points out in their amicus brief, it is quite likely that a large amount of the commingled grain is not only protected by patent, but is actually protected by a Plant Variety Protection Certificate, and what Petitioner did here would infringe the Plant Variety Protection Certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.792" offset="7593625">So even putting patent law to the side, this is not an economically viable source of seed for farmers, regardless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.046" offset="7618598">And Petitioner's argument again isn't limited to the grain elevators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.580" offset="7632809">It would apply to saving your own seed and planting it generation after generation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.551" offset="7648691">It would apply to selling seeds to your neighboring farmer, and it would allow seed companies to essentially compete with Monsanto upon the first sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.473" offset="7684322">Now to the extent--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1896.207" offset="7691323">So when -- when are the patent rights exhausted in the seed?</text>

            <text syncTime="1901.411" offset="7712116">--The patent rights are exhausted in the seed at the same time they are exhausted with respect to any other product, upon an authorized sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.750" offset="7745449">And so, Justice Breyer, again you had it right when you were saying that you can do what you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.887" offset="7766033">In our view, once there is an authorized sale you can do what you want with respect to the seed that you've actually purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.039" offset="7786617">That is the tangible article you paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.240" offset="7795395">But you do need permission from the patentholder in order to make a new generation of seed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.961" offset="7814307">To the extent, you know, any middle ground is warranted, with all due respect, we would point to Congress as the appropriate body.</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.277" offset="7911587">So if Monsanto authorized that first sale and authorized the planting, they would also have to authorize the sale of the second generation seed because it's a new article.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.701" offset="7953279">And that's exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.251" offset="7959444">If you look at the technology agreement -- and it's not just because it's a contract because I think it's significant to the analysis -- Monsanto, upon the first sale of the bag of Roundup Ready seed, authorizes the planting for one commercial crop and it authorizes the farmer to sell that as a commercial crop or to use it for any purpose other than replanting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.881" offset="8041991">That is an authorized sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.317" offset="8047737">So if you take that second generation seed -- “ second generation ” is a bit of a misnomer, but if you take that seed and you follow it through, all of the patent rights with respect to that particular seed have been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.308" offset="8095698">But you cannot take that seed without separate authorization, plant it in the ground, and come up with the next generation of seed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2165.049" offset="8766627">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.734" offset="8773419">Let me start by answering a couple of, I guess, science or technology questions that came up before launching into our doctrinal position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.171" offset="8807169">First of all, Justice Kennedy, soybeans are soybeans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.058" offset="8826709">They are harvested at a particular point in time, whatever use is going to be made for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.212" offset="8847293">It is not a plant like a flower, geranium for example, which has to be left to go to seed, or alfalfa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.783" offset="8873625">The bean is the seed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.552" offset="8880626">All soybeans have to be processed to be used in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.954" offset="8898284">If they are going to be planted, they have to be cleaned before they are put in the ground at the right time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.858" offset="8921899">If they are being fed to either humans or animals, they have to be processed in a way that eliminates an enzyme that makes them indigestible by animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.296" offset="8959620">Justice Scalia, your question about well, farmers now just can't do second plantings because soybeans are put in huge grain elevators and different varieties are mingled, that is true in the sense that if one or more of those soybeans were protected by a patent, the actual growing of the use of those patented inventions without a license would be infringement, although, of course, if no glyphosate were put on top of it, neither the farmer nor Monsanto would ever know that there was an act of infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.904" offset="9110085">But more to the point, farmers -- I mean, the planting of second crops, that is crop rotation of interspersing soybeans and winter wheat, is very, very common.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.196" offset="9151254">There are hundreds of thousands of soybean farmers who do this every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.014" offset="9170480">Mr. Bowman has acknowledged that so far as he knows, he's the only one who's doing it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.568" offset="9192737">But there are plenty of other ways in which he could obtain a much less expensive crop of -- you know, a particular variety of soybean, so one that will all grow to the same height and germinate at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.078" offset="9250729">And in fact, he explained this to the district court in his response to the motion for summary judgment at page 152a of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.267" offset="9287509">He said defendant wanted a cheap source of seed for his second crop beans because of the normal risks in growing “ wheat beans ”; that is, the second crop that follows the harvesting of winter wheat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.360" offset="9343933">Quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.060" offset="9346650">"defendant simply wasn't going to plant the high priced soybean seed after his wheat crop. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.031" offset="9370578">And here's the relevant sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.533" offset="9376639">"Defendant could have purchased conventional seed, that is, non-patented seed, and then saved its offspring for wheat beans. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.221" offset="9411329">In other words, he could have gone and bought a non-patented -- a bag of non-patented seed for much less money, and used it as his second crop, or harvested a portion of it -- and soybeans replicate at a rate between 20 and 80 times in each generation -- and have a perpetual source for his second crop thereafter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2380.206" offset="9627310">And he would not be able to use Monsanto's technology that would allow aerial application of an herbicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.379" offset="9660015">He would have to -- if he wanted to buy plain old, you know, conventional soybeans, he has to control for weeds in the conventional way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.883" offset="9690004">And here's the very next sentence in his response to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.668" offset="9701184">“ Defendant ” -- that is, instead of purchasing conventional seeds and saving them, he says</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.155" offset="9723127">"Defendant decided to purchase a grain dealer's commodity grain because he felt there was a good chance he would obtain mostly grain that would be resistant to glyphosate. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.112" offset="9766908">and therefore, he could use Monsanto's technology without having to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.098" offset="9786866">Mr. Chief Justice, your question about this is a new case and -- let me go first to your first question in the case, which is why would a company ever want to do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.341" offset="9839842">I think the answer is that without the ability -- let's talk about soybeans and then broaden it to other kinds of readily replicable technologies -- without the ability to limit reproduction of soybeans containing this patented trait, Monsanto could not have commercialized its invention, and never would have produced what is, by now, the most popular agricultural technology in America, because as Ms. Sherry was pointing out, the sale of the very first Roundup Ready soybean seed, from which all the trillions of Roundup Ready soybean seeds in existence now derive, would have under, Mr. Bowman's theory, fully exhausted not only Monsanto's rights in that seed that was sold, but in all progeny unto the -- however many generations Justice Breyer thinks is “ not too many ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.629" offset="10076929">I think it's important to understand how this technology works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.848" offset="10093857">The Department of Agriculture licensed Monsanto to engage in a transformation event; that is, to introduce its recombinant gene into soybean germ plasma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.193" offset="10155192">It's illegal to do it unless you get a government license to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.828" offset="10169821">And you can do it once.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.478" offset="10176404">And that is done by the technology company, use -- taking something what's called a gene gun and using the gene gun to inject recombinant DNA into regular germ plasma.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.239" offset="10443375">What happens then is that Monsanto uses those transformed cells to grow a soybean plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.978" offset="10474409">And that soybean plant produces genetic -- produces seeds or soybeans that have the recombinant Roundup Ready technology in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.601" offset="10512861">Monsanto then provides -- in almost all of the cases, Monsanto engages in licensed sales of those transformed seeds to hundreds of different seed companies that produce different varieties, and they make both conventional seed with a particular varietal makeup and a Roundup Ready version of that variety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.133" offset="10607006">Monsanto provides the soybeans that it has transformed to the seed companies, to the hundreds of seed companies for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.689" offset="10649220">Under Mr. Bowman's theory, that was it for all of Monsanto's rights with respect to this technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.578" offset="10676805">The very first time it took an original transformed seed and sold it to a seed company so that it could bulk up and cross-breed and produce different varieties, Monsanto had lost all of its patent rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.687" offset="10737200">In other words, by go at -- having committed hundreds of millions of dollars in 13 years to develop this technology in the very first sale of an article that practices the patent, it would have exhausted its rights in perpetuity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2974.989" offset="12006438">You did have this case in -- in Microsoft v. AT&amp;T that involved, you know, Microsoft's golden disk that has the Windows Operating System on it, which is patented, and was being exported overseas for introduction into, you know, computers that were manufactured overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.321" offset="12091702">And AT&amp;T's patent, which was a method of compressing speech, was practiced by the Windows software.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.444" offset="12128273">And this Court held that, although the writing of the Windows Operating System into computers in the United States would have infringed the patent, and when Microsoft did that it did infringe AT&amp;T's patent, the fact that the copies were made onto the hard drives of the computer overseas meant that the act of infringement occurred overseas and there was not an export of -- of an infringing product for the purposes of infringing overseas for purposes of Section 271(f).</text>

            <text syncTime="3086.646" offset="12453027">I mean, I would have thought it doesn't concern Monsanto's license of generation 1, because insofar as it's relevant here generation 1 carries the license that is just permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.535" offset="12496600">It is to create generation 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.970" offset="12506317">But -- but they also said something in the circuit about a license -- about a restriction, implied perhaps, on -- on the use of generation 2 by the grain elevator for creating generation 3, namely you can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.265" offset="12579564">Now, they -- they thought, the circuit, that there's some restriction in a license and they have a doctrine that seems to say that you can restrict licenses -- through licenses the use of a product after it's been sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.460" offset="12644348">And that would seem contrary to the first sale doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3137.812" offset="12657723">Let me -- let me answer your question this way: First of all, we don't think that there's any need whatsoever for this Court -- we agree with the Government that there's no need for the Court to address the question of conditional sales and the extent to which patent law recognizes under some circumstances conditional sales, because in this case the Federal Circuit did not address that ground which we advocated and we still advocate, but instead said -- and I'm reading from 14a of the petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.768" offset="12809546">"Even if Monsanto's patent rights in the commodity seeds are exhausted, such a conclusion would be of no consequence, because once a grower like Bowman plants the commodity seeds containing Monsanto's Roundup Ready technology and the next generation of seed develops, the grower has created a newly infringing article. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.200" offset="12899303">In other words, what the Federal Circuit decided, and it is entirely correct and it should be affirmed on that basis, is what you're calling I think generation 3, let's say that for simplicity's sake, since generation 1 is the original soybean sold by Monsanto to seed companies, let's just say that the bags of soybean seeds that farmers go to purchase from seed dealers is called generation N and they are licensed to produce generation N plus 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.604" offset="13028871">But then, what about N plus 2?</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.106" offset="13038902">So what the Federal Circuit held is N plus 2 has never been sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.127" offset="13067009">It was created, it exists without a sale, and because a sale is the sine qua non of patent exhaustion, which is also referred to as first sale, there is no exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.103" offset="13118836">Alternatively, the Federal Circuit said in any event, even when exhaustion applies, it only privileges the using or selling of the article sold; as Your Honor's questions pointed out originally, it never privileges the making of a new infringing product.</text>

            <text syncTime="3918.734" offset="15781445">And so grain elevators are certainly not allowed to dupe seed purchasers, but those laws are there to protect the seed purchasers.</text>
