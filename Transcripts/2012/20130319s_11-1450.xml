            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The second case is simpler.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.068" offset="125743">It's called “Standard Fire.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7.947" offset="137237">The Class Action Fairness Act provides that federal “District Court shall have original jurisdiction” of a civil “class-action” if among other things the “matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of five million dollars.”</text>
            <text syncTime="26.380" offset="210902">The statute adds that to determine whether the matter in controversy exceeds five million dollars, the claims, including the claims of any proposed class member shall be aggregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.458" offset="271297">In this case, a plaintiff filed a proposed class-action complaint in Arkansas State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.040" offset="297629">The defendants sought to remove the case to federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.623" offset="311944">The federal court aggregated the claims to those who fit the definition of the purported class.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.267" offset="338484">The Court found that the aggregate amount exceeded five million dollars, but the Court, nonetheless remanded the case to state court because the plaintiff had also filed a stipulation in which he promised the damages would not exceed five million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.359" offset="406821">This stipulation, the federal court decided, would assure that the sum or value of the claims would still, and nonetheless, fall below the five million dollar threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.045" offset="457603">In our view, however, the stipulation could not defeat otherwise proper federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.533" offset="483516">Our reason is a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.879" offset="492920">The stipulation was not binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.939" offset="505145">The class had not yet been certified and a stipulation does not bind proposed class members prior to certification, thus the stipulation cannot assure that the sum or value of the claims will fall below five million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.978" offset="573377">Our opinion sets forth the authority for these basic legal propositions and it explains our reasoning at somewhat greater length.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.360" offset="606814">Our decision is unanimous.</text>
