            <text syncTime="20.380" offset="187565">Those amendments provide authority to the executive to conduct surveillance targeted at foreign persons located abroad for foreign intelligence purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="68.472" offset="379931">--Your Honor, under the statute, there are two clear examples of situations in which the individuals would have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.842" offset="409397">The first is if an aggrieved person, someone who is a party to a communication, gets notice that the government intends to introduce information in a proceeding against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.509" offset="455999">They have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.351" offset="459447">That standing could include a facial challenge like the one here.</text>

            <text syncTime="95.054" offset="486197">Because, as I understand it, it's unlikely that, for example, the lawyers in this case would be charged with any criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.565" offset="532277">It's more probable that their clients would be; but, according to the government, their clients have no Fourth Amendment rights because they are people who are noncitizens who acted abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.995" offset="605942">So it's hard for me to envision.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.432" offset="615764">I see the theoretical possibility, but I don't see a real person who would be subject to a Federal charge who could raise an objection.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.686" offset="724747">But, in addition, Your Honor, the statute provides that electronic communication service providers can challenge authorizations under the act, so you -- there certainly would be standing in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.947" offset="761841">There was such a case.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.024" offset="782112">Well, the service provider did object to the immediate statutory predecessor to the 2008 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.192" offset="802801">And the FISA court litigated that constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.896" offset="817639">So there's a concrete context there in which it arises.</text>

            <text syncTime="184.720" offset="844910">The Court found there was no Fourth Amendment violation there.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.375" offset="855464">But I think the point here, Your Honor, is -- the key point is this, that the -- in a normal case, a plaintiff would challenge the application of the authority to that plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.370" offset="911470">In a situation like this one, we acknowledge that it may be difficult for a plaintiff to do so because an -- a challenge to the application gets into classified information pretty quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.161" offset="954625">I think what the Respondents have tried to do here is to find a theory of the case that avoids that difficulty.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.561" offset="1012303">Wouldn't the government then say as far as the merits of the complaint, this information is classified, is a state secret, we can't -- we can't go forward with the litigation?</text>

            <text syncTime="241.805" offset="1073221">Of course, there's a procedure that the executive branch would have to go through, but that's a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.728" offset="1088894">But I don't think we can get to that point, Your Honor, because I do think the key point here is that the Respondents' claims about this statute depend on a Cascade of speculation.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.417" offset="1191712">Given that lawyers are unlikely to be the targets of an investigation, if their conversations would be intercepted, according to you they'd never have standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3117.819" offset="12577338">Naomi Klein's declaration at page 338A addresses that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.957" offset="12601789">I believe that Chris Hedges' declaration addresses it too, although I don't have a page citation for you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.199" offset="12694785">So to some extent, they are making predictions about how third parties will -- will react, but I think it's an entire fair prediction to -- to predict that third parties who believe that the communications are being surveilled will react in the way you just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.207" offset="12754866">And although it's not in the record, we -- we have spoken to our journalist clients more recently and they have told us that their predictions have actually been realized in some cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3179.280" offset="12823098">I mean, I understand the Court's -- that the Court has to struggle with the distinction between cases that involve only future injuries and cases that involve present injuries as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.166" offset="12858625">I think it's just important to recognize that the Court has never found the kinds of present injuries that we are pointing to here to be irrelevant to the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.147" offset="12894569">In Monsanto, in Laidlaw, in Meese, in Camreta, the Court looked to -- looked to the present injuries as well as to the likelihood of -- of -- of future harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.797" offset="12937201">And we are not making an argument that we are entitled to a lower -- lower standing -- to lower standing requirements or less stringent requirements than the Court has applied in other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.511" offset="13736025">I think you'd still have the problem of speculation there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.636" offset="13744594">And if I could, Justice Breyer, go to your proposed solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.759" offset="13757028">I don't think it's a solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.620" offset="13764447">I think it's a mechanism for people who think they may be under surveillance, foreign terrorists who think they may be under surveillance, to find out whether they are or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3426.896" offset="13813557">First, the -- in every case in which the Court has found standing, every one on which the Respondents rely, the government conduct either happened or was certain to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.919" offset="13857652">In Meese against Keene, the films had been labeled as political propaganda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.261" offset="13879072">It wasn't a question about how authority to do so would be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.121" offset="13886491">In Laidlaw, the permit had issued, and the pollution was in the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.837" offset="13905403">There wasn't speculation about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.946" offset="13913763">Monsanto, we already talked about; the government action was certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.209" offset="13926824">That's true in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.680" offset="13932780">And Summers drew a distinction with those cases because, in Summers, there was no example of a concrete application of the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.019" offset="13962037">Second, their -- the fact that some of their clients may take steps that incur costs doesn't change the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.533" offset="14000176">It's still speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.828" offset="14005296">It's the kind of subjective chill that Laird said was -- was not sufficient to establish standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.950" offset="14029851">And I think, if you take a step back, think -- ask -- think about what they're asking you to do.</text>
