            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Sotomayor has our opinion this morning in case 12-236, Sebelius versus Cloer, which I will read for her in her absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.901" offset="146098">This case concerns whether attorney's fees maybe awarded on an untimely petition for compensation under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, what we call the NCVIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.300" offset="195626">If the petition was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis, the NCVIA establishes a no-fault compensation program for those injured by a vaccine.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.006" offset="242437">Parties who seek compensation under the NCVIA must file a petition including specified medical documentation with the clerk of the Court of Federal Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.829" offset="285800">This petition is then adjudicated by a special master who determines among other things whether the petition was filed within the NCVIA's 36-month limitations period and whether compensation should be paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.090" offset="346823">While attorneys who provide services in connection with the petition may not charge a fee for their work, the NCVIA provides for an award of attorney's fees for successful petitions and for those unsuccessful petitions brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.372" offset="415890">In 1997, after receiving her third Hepatitis B vaccine, respondent Melissa Cloer began to experience symptoms that eventually lead to a multiple sclerosis diagnosis in 2003.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.868" offset="473882">She filed a claim for compensation under the NCVIA in 2005 after she learned of a link between Hepatitis B vaccine and multiple sclerosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.983" offset="518395">The Special Master assigned to her petition determined that it was untimely for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.837" offset="541800">The en banc Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit agreed that Cloer's petition was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.764" offset="565520">Cloer then moved for an award of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.625" offset="576909">The government opposed her motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.962" offset="586313">The en banc Federal Circuit agreed with Cloer that even though her petition was untimely, it could qualify for an award of attorney's fees if it was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.321" offset="635737">We granted the government's petition for certiorari and now affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.894" offset="654023">The NCVIA's fees provision ties eligibility for an award for attorney's fees to a proceeding on “A petition filed under Section 300 aa-11 of Title XLII of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.749" offset="713477">And for its part, Section 300 aa-11 requires that a petition be filed with the clerk of the court to commence a proceeding for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.177" offset="751198">Nothing in either section suggests that the reason for the subsequent dismissal of a petition, such as untimeliness, nullifies the initial filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.696" offset="789232">As the term filed is commonly understood, an application is filed when it is delivered to and accepted by the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.879" offset="833954">So, once an NCVIA petition is delivered and accepted by the clerk of the court, it is filed for the purposes of the act and eligible for an award of attorney's fees even if untimely so long as it was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.283" offset="903544">The government's contrary argument that the NCVIA's 36-month limitations period is a statutory prerequisite to the filing of a petition lacks textual support.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.616" offset="948893">Neither Section §300aa-11 nor the fees provision references this limitations provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.060" offset="978672">And in order to adopt the government's argument, we would have to conclude that a petition filed out of time is a petition that was never filed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.195" offset="1019214">Such a result is contrary to the common understanding of the term filed and the text of the NCVIA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.980" offset="1050352">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.575" offset="1068743">Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas have joined the opinion as to all but Part II-B.</text>
