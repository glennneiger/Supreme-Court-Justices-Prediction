            <text syncTime="262.635" offset="1157283">The two States had a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.068" offset="1162926">Indiana agreed it was obligated to perform, but it wasn't performing.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.389" offset="1184242">There -- it was worried about a State court lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.257" offset="1195736">This Court exercised original jurisdiction to give Kentucky relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.495" offset="1216634">And I think that's analogous to what the district court did there.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.013" offset="1230740">The issue before us today, I think, is an issue of appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.164" offset="1251324">And the U.S. is seeking to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of Article III courts, notwithstanding that it doesn't seek relief; it seeks affirmance.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="296.806" offset="1293956">Well, the Solicitor General's standing argument is very abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.010" offset="1310779">But here is one possible way of understanding it, perhaps the Solicitor General will disavow it, but it would go like this: The President's position in this case is that he is going to continue to enforce DOMA, engage in conduct that he believes is unconstitutional, until this Court tells him to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.840" offset="1394057">The judgment of the Second Circuit told the Executive Branch to comply with the Equal Protection Clause immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.545" offset="1436898">The President disagrees with the temporal aspect of that, so the Executive is aggrieved in the sense that the Executive is ordered to do something prior to the point when the Executive believes it should do that thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.739" offset="1497607">Now, wouldn't that be sufficient to make -- to create injury in the Executive and render the Executive an aggrieved party?</text>

            <text syncTime="358.447" offset="1540447">I think not, because I don't see how that would be any different from any party saying, well, we really don't want to pay this judgment until we're sure all of the courts agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.485" offset="1580676">And I think this Court's -- this Court doesn't have a lot of case law where a party seeks review to get affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.074" offset="1610978">But in the Princeton University against Schmidt case, there was a State court conviction, Ohio State Court overturns it, Princeton University seeks review, because its regulations were at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.066" offset="1662910">New Jersey joins in seeking review, but does not ask for relief; does not take a position on what relief would be appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.772" offset="1701780">Why -- why wouldn't -- imagine -- there in Article II, it says that the President shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.828" offset="1745979">So the President has worked out -- I, personally, and for reasons in -- in my department, others think that this law is unconstitutional, but I have this obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.951" offset="1790492">And because I have this obligation, I will not, I will continue to execute this law.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.747" offset="1857679">Now, how is that different from a trustee who believes that he has an obligation to a trust to do something under a certain provision that he thinks doesn't require that, but, you know, there's a debate about it, but he says, I have the obligation here.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.734" offset="1997590">What I'm submitting to you that the trustee could not do, after getting the first -- the judgment in the court of first instance stating what the remedy -- what the liability is, then seek review of that judgment, but ask only for it to be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.812" offset="2065927">For -- if, in fact, as you agree, the trustee or other fiduciary in my example would indeed have standing to act according to the law, even though he thinks that that law is unconstitutional because of his obligation such as under Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.390" offset="2136248">You agree he has the -- he has -- there is standing when he goes into court in the first place, which surely he could interpret Article II as saying and you follow it through as long as you can do it, which includes appeals, until the matter is determined finally and authoritatively by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.487" offset="2220676">If you could do the first, what suddenly stops you from doing the second?</text>

            <text syncTime="650.097" offset="2707076">But even if we treat the injuries as sufficiently alleged, Article III requires that the party complaining of injury ask the court to remedy that injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.990" offset="2758694">And that's a very important requirement, I think, under Article III for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.477" offset="2780637">The idea of the case or controversy limitation, as I understand it, is part of a broader separation of powers picture, to make sure the Federal courts perform their proper role.</text>

            <text syncTime="2627.496" offset="10616640">--Justice Alito, I think it makes perfect sense in this context, because every -- each individual house has a constitutional rule before a statute is repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.117" offset="10651122">And so yes, it takes two of them to make the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2642.422" offset="10676408">So if the Executive wants to go into court and effectively seek the judicial repeal of a law, it makes sense that one house can essentially vindicate its role in our constitutional scheme by saying, wait a minute, we passed that law; it can't be repealed without our participation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2671.373" offset="10792183">In Raines, this Court carefully distinguished between the situation of an individual legislator and the situation of one of the houses as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.196" offset="10819455">And it specifically said this might be a different case if we had that kind of vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.980" offset="10834606">And that's what you have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.913" offset="10838367">That's what you had in Chadha.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.413" offset="10844323">And again, I do think that -- I mean, the only alternatives here are really to say that the Executive absolutely must enforce these laws, and if they don't, I mean, because after all -- you know, I -- I really don't understand why it's -- if they're not going to -- if they've made a determination that the law is unconstitutional, why it makes any sense for them to continue to enforce the law and put executive officers in the position of doing something that the President has determined is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.797" offset="10941917">I mean, think about the qualified immunity implications of that for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.682" offset="10953411">So that's problematic enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.132" offset="10959262">But if they're going to be able to do that and get anything more than a consent judgment, then the House is going to have to be able to play its role, and it's going to have to play the role of a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.621" offset="10993221">An amicus just doesn't get it done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.188" offset="10999491">And I really think, in a sense, the Executive gives the game away by conceding that our participation as an amicus here is necessary to solve what would otherwise be a glaring adverseness problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.513" offset="11040764">Because once you recognize that we can participate as an amicus, you've essentially recognized that there's nothing inherently executive about coming in and defending the constitutionality of an act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.469" offset="11080575">Or more to the point, there's nothing inherently unlegislative about coming in and making arguments in defense of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.874" offset="11106175">And if that's critical, absolutely necessary to ensure there's an adverse presentation of the issues, well, there's no reason the House should have to do that with one hand tied behind its back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.661" offset="11141283">If its participation is necessary, it should participate as a full party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.615" offset="11157166">And as I say, that's critically important in the lower courts so they can take depositions, build a factual record, and allow for a meaningful defense of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.038" offset="11190812">Because the alternative really puts the Executive Branch in an impossible position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.756" offset="11205754">It's a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.256" offset="11211710">They're the ones that are making litigation decisions to promote the defense of a statute they want to see invalidated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2824.020" offset="11402821">I have five points I'll try to get to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.388" offset="11412225">Just very quickly, Justice Breyer, I only answered part of a question you asked me earlier, and I just want to say, the U.S. is asking this Court to tell it to pay money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.827" offset="11450051">It's not asking for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.096" offset="11459037">Justice Sotomayor, you asked me about how the issue could come up otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.581" offset="11477009">I don't think I had a chance to mention, private party litigation, employees against employers, there's an interpleader action right now pending that was cited in the brief of the 287 employers -- on page 32 at note 54 -- giving examples of how the issue of DOMA's constitutionality could arise in private litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.312" offset="11559974">In addition, State and local government employees might have, for example, FMLA claims in which the issue could arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.084" offset="11587037">So I think that there are a number of ways in which the issue could arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.786" offset="11601874">On the question of what the purpose of 1252 could be if it wasn't to coincide with Article III injury that was raised by my -- my friend in his argument, I wonder whether the Court in Chadha wasn't saying something like this: 1252 was Congress's wish list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.116" offset="11683167">It was like -- like a citizen suit provision, to be exercised only to the extent that Article III power was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.037" offset="11710857">That's a way to make sense out of what the Court is doing in the text and footnote there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.674" offset="11729352">As to the question of BLAG, which has been very fully discussed already, I do want to say that after-the-fact authorization seems to me quite troubling and inconsistent with this Court's approach in Summers v. Earth Institute, and in the -- I think it was in the plurality in Lujan, where you -- you -- if a party has standing, they need to have it in the first court that they're in, either when it starts or certainly before judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.158" offset="11839275">And the rule as Justice Sotomayor observed just doesn't seem to say anything about authority to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.764" offset="11873757">I think that in addition, the -- the big problem here is the injury being complained of is inconsistent with the separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.786" offset="11909806">Bowsher and Buckley make very clear that once the litigation is enacted, Congress's authority to supervise it is at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.992" offset="11950661">It goes over to the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.844" offset="11958080">And whether the Executive Branch does it well or badly in the view of Congress, it's in its domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.431" offset="11984412">And separation of powers will not be meaningful if all it means is the Congress has to stay out unless it thinks that the President is doing it badly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.556" offset="12024954">So I think Article II helps give shape to what kinds of injuries alleged by parts of Congress can be cognizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.226" offset="12055569">Finally, the three -- two or three cases cited by my colleague who last spoke: Coleman, Karcher and Arizona, all involved State level of government, where the Federal separation of powers doctrines articulated in cases like Bowsher and Buckley were not at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.619" offset="13501185">And that's been true certainly in a number of situations under a number of statutes, so it's simply not the case that as long as you are married under State law you absolutely are going to be treated as married--</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.991" offset="13846629">For tax consequences, if you get a divorce every December, you know, for tax consequences, the State may well recognize that divorce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.850" offset="13914129">So the Federal Government has always treated this somewhat distinctly; it always has its own efforts; and I do think for purposes of the federalism issue, it really matters that all DOMA does is take this term where it appears in Federal law and define it for purposes of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.462" offset="13976510">It would obviously be a radically different case if Congress had, in 1996, decided to try to stop States from defining marriage in a particular way or dictate how they would decide it in that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.431" offset="14104405">But when it has 1,100 laws, which in our society means that the Federal Government is intertwined with the citizens' day-to-day life, you are at -- at real risk of running in conflict with what has always been thought to be the essence of the State police power, which is to regulate marriage, divorce, custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.250" offset="14215687">Well, Justice Kennedy, two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.167" offset="14223314">First of all, the very fact that there are 1,100 provisions of Federal law that define the terms “ marriage ” and “ spouse ” goes a long way to showing that Federal law has not just stayed completely out of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.343" offset="14272111">It's gotten involved in them in a variety of contexts where there is an independent Federal power that supported that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.995" offset="14294681">Now, the second thing is the fact that DOMA affects all 1,100 statutes at once is not really a sign of its irrationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.915" offset="14326341">It is a sign that what it is, and all it has ever purported to be, is a definitional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.986" offset="14346612">And like every other provision in the Dictionary Act, what it does is it defines the term wherever it appears in Federal law in a consistent way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.175" offset="14383393">And that was part and parcel of what Congress was trying to accomplish with DOMA in 1996.</text>

            <text syncTime="3573.979" offset="14402619">Well, but it's not really uniformity because it regulates only one aspect of marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.698" offset="14421532">It doesn't regulate all of marriage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3580.567" offset="14428950">Well, that's true but I don't think that's a mark against it for federalism purposes, and it -- it addressed a particular issue at a point, remember in 1996, Congress is addressing this issue because they are thinking that the State of Hawaii through its judicial action is about to change the definition of marriage from a way that it had been defined in every jurisdiction in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.182" offset="14523409">And what that meant is that when Congress passed every one of the statutes affected by DOMA's definition, the Congress that was passing that statute had in mind the traditional definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.721" offset="14561548">And so Congress in 1996 at that point says, the States are about to experiment with changing this, but the one thing we know is all these Federal statutes were passed with the traditional definition in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.695" offset="14609509">And if rational basis is the test, it has to be rational for Congress then to say, well, we are going to reaffirm what this word has always meant for purposes of Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3634.884" offset="14646185">Suppose we look just at the estate tax provision that's at issue in this case, which provides specially favorable treatment to a married couple as opposed to any other individual or economic unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.061" offset="14706893">What was the purpose of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.429" offset="14716402">Was the purpose of that really to foster traditional marriage, or was Congress just looking for a convenient category to capture households that function as a unified economic unit?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="3668.690" offset="14781499">Well, I think for these purposes actually, Justice Alito, if you go back to the beginning of the estate tax deduction, what Congress was trying to do was trying to provide uniform treatment of taxpayers across jurisdictions, and if you look at the brief that Senator Hatch and some other Senators filed, they discussed this history, because what was happening in 1948 when this provision was initially put into Federal law was you had community property States and common law States, and actually there was much more favorable tax treatment if you were in a community law State than a common law State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.810" offset="14897901">And Congress didn't want to have an artificial incentive for States to move from common law to community property; it wanted to treat citizens the same way no matter what State they were in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.915" offset="14934367">So it said, we will give a uniform Federal deduction based on marriage, and I think what that shows is that when the Federal Government gets involved in the issue of marriage, it has a particularly acute interest in uniform treatment of people across State lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.325" offset="14991941">So Ms. Windsor wants to point to the unfairness of the differential treatment of treating two New York married couples differently, and of course for purposes of New York law that's exactly the right focus, but for purposes of Federal law it's much more rational for Congress to -- to say, and certainly a rational available choice, for Congress to say, we want to treat the same-sex couple in New York the same way as the committed same-sex couple in Oklahoma and treat them the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="4303.451" offset="17320496">So we have a whole series of cases which suggest the following: Which suggest that when Congress targets a group that is not everybody's favorite group in the world, that we look at those cases with some -- even if they're not suspect -- with some rigor to say, do we really think that Congress was doing this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that Congress's judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by animus, and so forth?</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.239" offset="17447661">I guess the question that this statute raises, this statute that does something that's really never been done before, is whether that sends up a pretty good red flag that that's what was going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="4350.082" offset="17507011">First of all, I think I would take issue with the premise, first of all, that this is such an unusual Federal involvement on an issue like marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.771" offset="17541806">If you look at historically, not only has the Federal Government defined marriage for its own purposes distinctly in the context of particular -- particular programs, it's also intervened in -- in other areas, including in-state prerogatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.531" offset="17600843">I mean, there's a reason that four state constitutions include a prohibition on polygamy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.999" offset="17618710">It's because the Federal Congress insisted on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.368" offset="17628114">There is a reason that, in the wake of the Civil War and in Reconstruction, Congress specifically wanted to provide benefits for spouses of freed slaves who fought for the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.243" offset="17671687">In order to do it, it essentially had to create state law marriages, because in the Confederacy, the slaves couldn't get married.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.813" offset="17697914">So they developed their own State -- essentially, a Federal, sort of, condition to define who was married under those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.500" offset="17724663">So where there was the needs in the past to get involved, the Federal Government has got involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.202" offset="17739501">The other point I would make -- but I also eventually want to get around to the animus point -- but the other point I would make is: When you look at Congress doing something that is unusual, that deviates from the way they -- they have proceeded in the past, you have to ask, Well, was there good reason?</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.880" offset="17802194">And in a sense, you have to understand that, in 1996, something's happening that is, in a sense, forcing Congress to choose between its historic practice of deferring to the States and its historic practice of preferring uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.073" offset="17863007">Up until 1996, it essentially has it both ways: Every State has the traditional definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.942" offset="17882443">Congress knows that's the definition that's embedded in every Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="5347.274" offset="21495804">And the reason for that is because the statute is not directed at uniformity in the administration of Federal benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="6697.267" offset="26895732">First of all, I was not surprised to hear the Solicitor General concede that there is no unique federalism problem with DOMA, because in the Gill litigation in the First Circuit, the State of Massachusetts -- the Commonwealth of Massachusetts invoked the Tenth Amendment, and on that issue the United States continued to defend DOMA because there is no unique federalism problem with it, as the Chief Justice's question suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="6720.715" offset="26989564">If 10 years from now there are only 9 States left and Congress wants to adopt a uniform Federal law solely for Federal law purposes to going the other way, it is fully entitled to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6731.690" offset="27033450">It has the power to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6733.123" offset="27039197">I would say also the Federal Government has conceded in this litigation that there is a rational basis for this statute, something else to keep in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="6740.279" offset="27067827">I would also say that this provision is not so unique.</text>

            <text syncTime="6758.089" offset="27139089">But the history of this Court is, in the very first gender discrimination case, Reed v. Reed, the Court did something it had never done in the history of the country under rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6769.480" offset="27184647">There was no intermediate tier then.</text>

            <text syncTime="6785.908" offset="27250371">And the Solicitor General says, well, you know, the United States is not the 51st State to be sure, but the Federal Government has interests in uniformity that no other entity has.</text>
            <text syncTime="6794.698" offset="27285479">And we heard today that there's a problem; when somebody moves from New York to North Carolina, they can lose their benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6800.502" offset="27308676">The Federal Government uniquely, unlike the 50 States, can say, well, that doesn't make any sense, we are going to have the same rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6806.338" offset="27332082">We don't want somebody, if they are going to be transferred in the military from West Point to Fort Sill in Oklahoma, to resist the transfer because they are going to lose some benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6814.594" offset="27365101">It makes sense to have a uniform Federal rule for the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6818.479" offset="27380565">It is not so anomalous that the term “ marriage ” is defined in the U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="6822.265" offset="27395716">The very next provision of the Dictionary Act defines “ child ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6824.883" offset="27406270">These terms, although they are the primary province of State governments, do appear in multiple Federal statutes and it's a Federal role to define those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="6833.739" offset="27441692">The last point I would simply make is in thinking about animus, think about the fact that Congress asked the Justice Department three times about the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6842.945" offset="27478472">That's not what you do when you are motivated by animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="6845.047" offset="27486831">The first two times they got back the answer it was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="6847.915" offset="27498325">The third time, they asked again in the wake of Romer, and they got the same answer: It's constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="6852.467" offset="27516611">Now the Solicitor General wants to say:</text>
            <text syncTime="6854.669" offset="27525388">Well, it was want of careful reflection?</text>
            <text syncTime="6857.104" offset="27535105">Well, where do we get careful reflection in our system?</text>
            <text syncTime="6859.473" offset="27544614">Generally, careful reflection comes in the democratic process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6862.508" offset="27556735">The democratic process requires people to persuade people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6866.294" offset="27571886">The reason there has been a sea change is a combination of political power, as defined by this Court's cases as getting the attention of lawmakers; certainly they have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6875.233" offset="27607621">But it's also persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6877.085" offset="27615040">That's what the democratic process requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="6878.752" offset="27621727">You have to persuade somebody you're right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6880.470" offset="27628519">You don't label them a bigot.</text>
            <text syncTime="6881.820" offset="27633953">You don't label them as motivated by animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="6883.756" offset="27641685">You persuade them you are right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6885.306" offset="27647954">That's going on across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6887.207" offset="27655478">Colorado, the State that brought you Amendment 2, has just recognized civil unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6891.511" offset="27672719">Maine, that was pointed to in the record in this case as being evidence of the persistence of discrimination because they voted down a statewide referendum, the next election cycle it came out the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6900.883" offset="27710230">And the Federal Congress is not immune.</text>
