            <text syncTime="7.954" offset="138318">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.256" offset="151484">Rule 54(d) provides a standard for an award of costs to a prevailing party that, by the rule's express terms, does not apply where Federal statute provides otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.112" offset="194951">The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act provides otherwise because it states a different rule for awarding costs than does Rule 54(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="30.867" offset="229955">Whereas Rule 54(d) gives district courts wide discretion toward cost-prevailing defendants, the FDCPA limits courts' discretion to cases brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.025" offset="278648">The text of the Act provides that on a finding that action was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the court may award attorneys' fees of reasonable relation to the work expended and costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.268" offset="327549">That's a matter of grammar.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.235" offset="335490">The unmistakable meaning of that sentence is that an award of costs, like an award of attorney's fees, is subject to the condition that the plaintiff suit be brought--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="66.790" offset="373629">Under -- under that provision, that's certainly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.625" offset="385018">You can't -- you can't get costs under that provision unless there has been that prerequisite.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.181" offset="411245">But it's -- it's ancient law that repeals by implication are not favored.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.352" offset="443951">And what you're arguing here is that that provision effectively repeals another provision which allows costs in all cases, whether or not there has been misbehavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.945" offset="502256">Now, why -- why is this an exception to our general rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="103.665" offset="521169">I just don't -- this doesn't seem to me like the clear repealer.</text>

            <text syncTime="107.783" offset="537678">--Well, there's no need to consider repeal by implication in this case, Your Honor, because Rule 54(d) expressly states that its presumption does not apply for a Federal--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="118.425" offset="580205">Yes, indeed, but -- but you are assuming a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.162" offset="599118">You're saying either the -- the statute applies or Rule 54(d) applies, but the statute can be read to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="133.201" offset="639346">"We're describing one category of case. "</text>
            <text syncTime="137.570" offset="656796">"We are describing the worst case; the bad-faith harassing plaintiff. "</text>
            <text syncTime="143.057" offset="678739">and the statute deals with that category of person and no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.294" offset="703712">So if you're not a bad-faith harassing plaintiff, but you nonetheless lost, then you're under 54(d).</text>

            <text syncTime="158.133" offset="739030">--Your Honor, if you look at Section k(a)(3) as a whole, the two sentences together confirm that this is not a provision about bad-faith plaintiffs, but, rather, the provision is addressing both fees and costs to -- to plaintiffs and defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.647" offset="821054">And if -- if the Congress merely wanted to state in that second sentence that fees were available and didn't mean to say anything about costs to defendants, there would have been no reason for Congress to have put costs in that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.925" offset="890226">If--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="196.877" offset="893988">Well, there are a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.893" offset="902034">One is symmetry, because they have costs in the part about defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.666" offset="933172">And the concern that, well, if we leave out costs for the bad-faith harassing plaintiff, then it -- it may be assumed that they get only attorney's fees and not costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.646" offset="1013106">So the statute's provisions like this may be redundant, but one can see that a drafter might very well want to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="238.804" offset="1061694">"Well, we said we're dealing with the defendant costs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="241.839" offset="1073815">"We want to put the same thing in a plaintiff. "</text>

            <text syncTime="246.024" offset="1090638">--Well, you've made a few points, and I'll try to address each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.976" offset="1102445">First, there would be no reason to include costs in the second sentence just because it was in the first sentence, because the first and second sentences are not parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.516" offset="1140584">The first sentence makes an award of costs mandatory, and, therefore, it does do some work beyond 54(d); it clearly has a function in that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.723" offset="1181440">Whereas the second sentence, the award is subject to the “ may ”; that is, that it's not mandatory that the court award them.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.210" offset="1211324">If -- if Congress was -- Congress would have no need to be concerned that if it left costs out of the second sentence there would be some negative implication, because there are several statutes that mention fees without costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.137" offset="1271092">And GRC has cited no instance in which a court has read a negative implication into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.326" offset="1295856">We, in our reply brief, cited a couple cases that do the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.028" offset="1310589">It's -- so, therefore, if Congress had omitted costs, left it out of the sentence, then Rule 54(d) would have continued to apply in cases where the defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.052" offset="1362729">Didn't -- don't district courts always have the authority to award costs for sanctionable behavior like bad faith?</text>
            <text syncTime="321.274" offset="1391569">So this provision is duplicate no matter how we read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.310" offset="1407764">It's either duplicative of a power the court already had to award costs for bad faith or it's duplicate of Rule 54.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.534" offset="1452591">--Well, if you read this sentence as a misconduct provision, then it does repeat the court's inherent authority; although, as this court has mentioned in a couple cases, sometimes statutes want to reiterate authority that exists elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.579" offset="1520822">If you read it our way, however, the statute -- this provision does actually do some work that it wouldn't otherwise do.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.685" offset="1557289">That is, it limits cost awards to prevailing defendants of these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.221" offset="1683409">There are other statutes that do -- similarly do what we've -- what's done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.141" offset="1715069">Congress could have omitted -- if GRC is correct, Congress could have just omitted the words “ and costs ”, leaving the costs to be determined under Rule 54.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.247" offset="1759477">An example of that is 15 U.S.C. 15c(d)(2), which is actions by state attorneys general and provides that the court may award attorneys fees to a prevailing defendant upon a finding that the action was in bad faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.532" offset="2072633">Congress gave defendants something more here.</text>

            <label>Ms. Allison M. Zieve</label>
            <text syncTime="510.993" offset="2150478">Well, first, Your Honor, the Congress's purpose was not simply to -- this isn't just a defendant-friendly provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.170" offset="2203141">Congress had dual purposes in enacting k(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="527.788" offset="2217665">On the one hand, Congress wanted to deter nuisance suits, but on the other hand, Congress wanted to ensure that meritorious suits by impecunious debtors were not deterred by the prospect that an award of costs would exceed the value of the damage that could be recovered in a successful suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.381" offset="2287986">And the two provisions of k(a)(3) show the line Congress drew and how it balanced those two objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.836" offset="2321841">As to the other statutes, the Truth in Lending Act, the Credit Repair Organizations Act, they were enacted at different times by different Congresses, they have different sorts of provisions, some better for plaintiffs, some better for defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.079" offset="2378788">And -- but this category -- in enacting this statute, Congress emphasized that the widespread and national serious problem of collection abuse that Congress said inflicts substantial suffering and anguish, and noted specifically in the Senate report this Court has cited to in the Jerman case that consumers, the impecunious -- the people who can't even afford to pay their debts, are the primary enforcers of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.532" offset="2496653">The FTC got about 120,000 complaints from consumers about debt collectors last year, more than any other industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.638" offset="2529044">So Congress may reasonably have decided that the primary enforcers of this statute weren't going to be doing that work if they were -- if they were at risk of significant cost awards in cases that have frequently small value.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.968" offset="2610337">There are other ways, if Congress wanted to preserve Rule 54(d), that it could have done it that did not happen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.525" offset="2660597">For instance, in 49 U.S.C. 14707 (c), Congress has a similar provision about attorney's fees to prevailing -- attorney's fees to prevailing parties, and then states expressly that fee is in addition to costs allowable under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.387" offset="2732068">Congress didn't do that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.839" offset="2737815">Or Congress could have made it clear that it was not displacing Rule 54(d) as to cost awards by stating that the Court could award attorney's fees as part of the cost, therefore distinguishing fees and costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.563" offset="2792777">Congress has done that sort of thing frequently, including in a statute that provides for an award in cases of bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.336" offset="2819840">I'm looking at 28 U.S.C. 1875, that provides the courts may award fees as part of costs if an action was frivolous or in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.942" offset="2862262">So -- but Congress did none of those things here.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.810" offset="2873756">Instead, what it did was draft a sentence that links the term “ cost ” to the term “ attorney's fees ” with the conjunction “ and ”, and subjects both of those objects of the sentence to the same condition, the condition that the plaintiff suit was brought in bad faith and for purpose of harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.272" offset="2947631">GRC suggests that the reading -- that the statute the Justice mentioned, benefits plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.615" offset="3004995">But what Congress wanted to do here -- I mean, would benefit plaintiff -- what Congress wanted to do was to help defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.952" offset="3030282">There's actually no legislative history about why this provision was put in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.606" offset="3052956">What we have instead, for what it's worth, is a markup later where this provision is discussed in response to concerns that frivolous suits should be deterred, and this provision, which is now already in the statute, is discussed as one means of deterring frivolous suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.871" offset="3145952">But the bad faith and harassment standard is the dividing line that Congress drew between nuisance suits and other suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.494" offset="3184509">This case is clearly on the non-nuisance side of the line, and cases on that side of the line are not subject to an award of costs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric J. Feigin</label>
            <text syncTime="873.062" offset="3598706">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="879.817" offset="3625769">Rule 54(d) expressly codifies in absolute form the well-established principle that a specific provision displaces a more general one.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.589" offset="3660878">And I think that principle is very helpful here in answering a couple of the questions that have come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.791" offset="3677701">First of all, it makes clear that no express textual conflict is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.279" offset="3699644">This Court's never required one, and the specific governs the general cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.814" offset="3713750">Let's make even clearer, if you look at the pre-2007 version of the rule, which is meant to be substantively identical to the current version of the rule -- this is at page 12 of the government's brief -- and the original version of the rule said,</text>
            <text syncTime="914.472" offset="3764427">"except when express provision therefore is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, costs should be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the Court otherwise directs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="924.929" offset="3806223">I think that that makes quite clear that when, as the FDCPA does, there is a specific statutory provision that addresses an award of costs incident to the judgment, that specific statutory provision prevails over the default rule that Rule 54(d) contains.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.558" offset="3872783">Another point about the specific governing the general principle is it would apply here even if the Court believed that Section 1692k(a)(3) covered some type of circumstances that Rule 54(d) and other things don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.032" offset="3926595">And that's made quite clear by this Court's recent eight-Justice unanimous opinion in RadLAX Gateway Hotel v. Amalgamated Bank, in which the Court said, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="964.304" offset="3963689">"We know of no authority for the proposition that the canon. "</text>
            <text syncTime="967.256" offset="3975497">--they're talking about the specific governance, the general canon --</text>
            <text syncTime="970.006" offset="3986573">"is confined to situations in which the entirety of the specific provision is a. "</text>

            <text syncTime="985.551" offset="4048744">And I don't know what to say other than the impression -- the impression is that subsection 3, which is what's at issue, the whole thing is meant to say that the winner, when it's the plaintiff, is going to get attorney's fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.512" offset="4120529">And then when you get to the second sentence of that, it means, and if you're in bad faith, the plaintiff, then the defendant gets attorney's fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.603" offset="6108865">Our position is that the second sentence of section 1692k(a)(3) is a pro-defendant provision that does not strip courts of their discretion under Rule 54 to award costs to prevailing defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.665" offset="6189113">As to the text, the second sentence states that a court may award an affirmative grant of power rather than the court may award attorney's fees and costs if a plaintiff files a lawsuit in bad faith.</text>
