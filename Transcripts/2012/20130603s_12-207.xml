            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Kennedy has our opinion this morning in case 12-207, Maryland versus King.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.387" offset="134938">In 2003, a man concealing his face and armed with a gun broke into a woman's home in Salisbury, Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.802" offset="164613">He raped her.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.242" offset="170360">The police were unable to apprehend the assailant but they did obtain from the victim a sample of his DNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.596" offset="199826">Some six years later, in 2009, Alonzo King, who is the respondent here, was arrested in Maryland for a different crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.004" offset="241413">He was arrested for assault while brandishing a weapon and this was an arrest for a serious offense as defined by Maryland law.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.233" offset="278403">As part of a routine booking procedure for serious offenses authorized by Maryland law, King's DNA was taken when he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.395" offset="311003">Now to take a DNA sample, officers have the subject to open his mouth, they use a swab that looks like a long Q-tip to take the sample.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.375" offset="346948">Now the procedure is routine and painless.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.148" offset="358024">King's DNA was found to match the DNA taken from the Salisbury rape victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.545" offset="379549">This information led to King's trial and conviction for the rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.960" offset="401283">CODIS is the DNA nationwide database that's used to connect DNA laboratories for this matching process, they're connected nationwide by CODIS.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.810" offset="452692">In this case, it took about four months from the time the sample was first taken from King until the report matching DNA from the rape was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.967" offset="489263">But the time was often faster and in any event, the bail determination or actual release of the serious offender as a routine matter before trial, can take weeks or months.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.408" offset="531059">The Court of Appeals of Maryland set aside King's rape conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.047" offset="549658">It ruled that the DNA taken when King was arrested in 2009 was a violation of the Fourth Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.355" offset="586856">They held that it was a violation because it was an unreasonable search.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.069" offset="601694">This Court now reverses the judgment of the Maryland court.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.546" offset="615591">The advent of DNA technology is one of the most significant scientific advances of our era.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.798" offset="636594">The full potential for use of genetic markers in science and medicine is still being explored, but the utility of DNA identification in the criminal justice system is already undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.295" offset="682569">Although the DNA sample procedure used here presents a question this Court has not yet addressed, the framework for deciding the issue was well established.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.442" offset="719141">The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable search and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.018" offset="733456">There can be no dispute that the DNA swab process is a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.782" offset="752577">But the fact that a DNA swab is a much more gentle process than say a needle that's used to withdraw blood is of central relevance in determining whether the search is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.355" offset="798866">The ultimate measure of the constitutionality of the governmental search is reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.531" offset="819555">In ruling that the search was reasonable, today's opinion explains that the legitimate government interest served by a DNA identification is one that is well established, the need for law enforcement officers in a safe and accurate way to process and identify the persons they must take into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.041" offset="893534">When probable cause exists to remove an individual from the normal channels of society on charges for a serious offense and hold him with proper safeguards in legal custody or release him on bail with adequate conditions, DNA identification plays a critical role in serving those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.023" offset="965528">An individual's identity is more than just his name or social security number.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.698" offset="988202">The government's interest in identification goes beyond ensuring that the proper name is typed on the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.593" offset="1015787">A suspect's criminal history is a critical part of his identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.148" offset="1033968">Police already seek this information using a variety of long approved means, notably the comparison of an arrestee's fingerprints against databases of known criminals and unsolved crimes. Identification necessarily entails searching public and police records to see what is already known about an arrestee.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.006" offset="1109410">DNA is another means of identification used to connect the arrestee with his or her public persona as reflected in records of his or her actions that are available to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.684" offset="1152146">This includes matching to other DNA samples previously collected from crime scenes.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.624" offset="1171895">This information found in official records is checked as a routine matter to produce a more comprehensive record of the suspect's complete identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.114" offset="1205854">In this respect, an arrestee's CODIS profile is a different form of identification than a name or fingerprint but its function is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.477" offset="1243366">Now among the many reasons for this identification, why this identification is important is to determine whether an arrestee can be released pending trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.246" offset="1286416">DNA identification establishing more about the person's identity and background can provide critical information relevant to the conditions of his release and whether to revisit an initial release determination and as said earlier, sometimes this process takes months in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.015" offset="1349528">Pre-trial release is the most serious responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.202" offset="1362275">It is reasonable in all respects for the state to use an accepted database to determine if an arrestee is the object of suspicion in other serious crimes, suspicion that may provide a strong incentive for the arrestee to escape or to flee on -- after him being released.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.607" offset="1423820">Given the importance of DNA and the identification of police records pertaining to arrestees and the need to refine and confirm that identity for its important bearing on the decision to continue release on bail or impose new conditions or to revoke bail, DNA serves an essential purpose despite the existence of delays such as the delay that occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.261" offset="1514412">By comparison to this substantial government interest and the unique effectiveness of DNA identification, the intrusion of a cheek swab to obtain a DNA sample is a minimum one.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.572" offset="1559656">In addition, the processing of King's DNA did not intrude on his privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.570" offset="1579719">The CODIS points of comparison come from non-coding parts of the DNA that do not reveal genetic traits of the arrestee and Maryland law provides a substantial statutory protection system to guard against further invasion of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.421" offset="1655056">For these reasons and others set forth in the opinion published today, the Court concludes that DNA identification of arrestees is a reasonable search that can be considered part of a routine booking procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.352" offset="1698837">The judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.102" offset="1709808">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan join.</text>
