            <text syncTime="10.022" offset="145991">The first sentence of Section 7703(b)(2) provides that district courts have jurisdiction over all mixed cases, and that provision is largely dispositive here.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.329" offset="191235">The second section of 7703(b)(2) on which the government relies is a statute of limitations, and it doesn't limit the jurisdiction of Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.369" offset="231359">That subsection is set out at pages 16a to 17a of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.875" offset="261452">The first sentence provides that for a described category of cases, they are to be, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="46.945" offset="293739">"filed under one of the listed federal antidiscrimination statutes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="51.599" offset="312338">As this Court pointed out in Elgin, all of those are statutes which authorize jurisdiction in claims in district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.889" offset="349432">Indeed, in Title VII and the ADEA, that is the only Federal court which is authorized to hear the cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="90.491" offset="467924">With regard to the -- when the case gets to district court, there may be two substantive claims, a discrimination claim and a CSRA claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.299" offset="519124">Your question, I take it, is about the former.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.250" offset="526960">Our view is that the claim is filed and pled, as indeed it was pled in this case, as a discrimination case; in this case, under several different statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.522" offset="568025">And the complaint here reads very much like an ordinary discrimination complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.058" offset="582131">The government may raise the -- that sort of procedural issue as an affirmative defense, and it would be free to do so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.664" offset="616613">And that -- that happens on a number of occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.782" offset="629047">For example, if there were a case in which the Plaintiff had not, as required by the regulations, appealed to the MSPB within 30 days of the -- of receipt of the agency decision, the government could move to dismiss that claim on what the lower courts call exhaustion grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.945" offset="705742">And the lower courts have repeatedly sustained those motions--</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="342.900" offset="1477504">Prior to that, courts were applying the judicially fashioned exhaustion requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.919" offset="1505612">And the -- Congress made a decision to replace that.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.073" offset="1522226">As this Court noted in Chandler and in Brown v. GSA, Congress concluded, I think correctly, and the Court's opinion suggests that, that the steps necessary to exhaust were not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.898" offset="1573530">So the regime established by Section 717 of Title VII, which was adopted in 1972, sets up an exhaustion requirement which is clear, simple and limited in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.722" offset="1624835">It requires the plaintiff to file a complaint, wait at that point 180 days, and at that point, the plaintiff was done and could go to district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.911" offset="1665586">Plaintiff also had the option at that point of going to the Civil Service Commission, waiting 180 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.315" offset="1691186">But as long as a timely complaint was filed, that was all that was required of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.719" offset="1712815">And that was a fundamental change in the way this had been dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.539" offset="1728071">The ADEA regime, which was adopted in 1974, was actually even simpler, although it's been changed a little bit since.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.843" offset="1757328">The plaintiff to exhaust had to do only one of two things, either file a complaint with the EEOC, period, or give the EEOC notice that the plaintiff was going to sue and wait 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.603" offset="1812289">As the government pointed out in its brief in Stevens, the exhaustion regime under the ADEA hadn't -- didn't in any way address what happened after the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.077" offset="1858265">It simply said, file the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.844" offset="1865266">That is the fundamental principle that's animated the Title VII exhaustion requirement in Title VII and the ADEA, and we don't think the CSRA was written to change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.235" offset="1910823">Indeed, to the contrary, the CSRA has -- it doesn't do so expressly -- it incorporates by reference those statutes; it expressly reiterates the de novo exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.078" offset="1970278">It actually shortened the period of time that plaintiff has to wait for these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.494" offset="6547871">--I agree that there is no basis for the distinction and part of that is because, as my friend Mr. Schnapper pointed out, there is an EEOC regulation providing that when the board dismisses a case on jurisdictional grounds the case can go back to the agency, the agency can essentially reissue its final decision, and then the plaintiff goes in to district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.604" offset="6612342">So if the whole point is to find a way for an employee to get into district court on her discrimination claim, we've already had that taken care of in jurisdictional dismissal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.375" offset="6647450">So the action really here is with procedural dismissals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.911" offset="6661556">And I would like to start with Justice Scalia's line of questions about whether there has been a repeal of the right to go to district court on discrimination claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.500" offset="6691963">And I think our starting point is in the Federal Courts Improvement Act which is 28 USC 1295(a)(9) which provides that review of MSPB decisions is exclusively in the Federal circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.075" offset="6742222">This court most recently in Elgin but in various cases over of the last 25 years has seen that that is an exclusive grant of judicial review of jurisdiction in the Federal circuit over MSPB final decisions, and as the Court pointed out in Elgin the only exception to that is for the subset of final board decisions that are covered in 7703(b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.006" offset="6829994">And if you look at 7703(b)(2) the only reference to a final board decision is at the top of page 17a of the Government's brief is to judicially reviewable actions under section 7702.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.914" offset="6885582">Now we put a lot of emphasis on the phrase judicially reviewable action and the reason we do that is because throughout the entire U.S. Code that phrase is only ever used either in or in reference to section 7702.</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.047" offset="6986102">I mean, we think of a -- we review cases on procedural objections all the time and we think of those as judicially reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.785" offset="7017031">It's -- it's a real stretch to say simply because it says “ judicially reviewable ” it means judicially reviewable on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.991" offset="7049840">Well, in our view, again, because it uses the phrase “ judicially reviewable action ” under 7702 and that phrase “ judicially reviewable action ” in the whole U.S. Code is only ever used when you are talking about 7702, that -- in our view that's the signal that that's a term of art in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.250" offset="7110967">So although dismissal on procedural grounds is a board action subject to judicial review, in our view it's not a judicially reviewable action under 7702.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.769" offset="7661001">But the second answer is, even for that brief window after the CSRA was enacted before the Federal Circuit was created, Congress still had taken away jurisdiction from district courts over board decisions and had directed them to the courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.112" offset="7722337">And this Court recognized in Fausto that that -- Congress specifically had that intent when it enacted the CSRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.765" offset="7745011">It was tired of this concurrent jurisdiction in all the district courts throughout the country over Federal employment actions and it wanted to reduce a layer of review and direct them to fewer courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2071.788" offset="8393057">The one that's relevant in this case is in subsection (a)(3), which is on page 9a in the middle of the page there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.975" offset="11349804">But I think Congress did accomplish in a pretty simple way what you suggest, which is directing that procedural rules should be reviewed in the Federal circuit, and it did that by making that the background rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.932" offset="11393690">In 7703(a) and (b)(1), it says, final decisions of the board are reviewed in the Federal circuit, full stop only, except as provided in (b)(2).</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.451" offset="11831711">As suggested here, the only reason -- the only way it would come up is as part of an affirmative defense by the agency, a defense of exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.989" offset="11865880">But then generally speaking it would have to be a procedural issue that the Government, that the agency raised before the board and the board rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.429" offset="11895659">Now, the board's own regulations allow the board to waive any of its -- any of its regulatory requirements, including timeliness, for good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.518" offset="11932022">And so the Government would have to argue in the district court that essentially the board abused its discretion by not waiving a procedural objection, and that's a very high hurdle and I think it's really hard to imagine very many cases in which that's going to come up, where the Government's going to make that kind of argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="3111.518" offset="12551960">Under your reading both should be given identical meaning, because they both cross-reference 7702; and yet your brief says, no, we shouldn't have that absurd result.</text>

            <text syncTime="3274.790" offset="13205125">In our view she is seeking review over the board decision, the board decision decided that her appeal was untimely, that there wasn't good cause to excuse the untimeliness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.498" offset="13375862">--I -- I am happy to do so, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.948" offset="13381713">You pointed out that -- that where subject matter jurisdiction is concerned, is it important that rules be clear?</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.520" offset="13408044">And you asked counsel for Respondent, why was Respondent's rule clearer than the Petitioner's rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.758" offset="13432913">In this case our rule is demonstrably clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.327" offset="13455274">The question is which mixed cases go to the district court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.113" offset="13466350">Our answer is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.729" offset="13472828">The Government's answer, the rule that is derived from Ballentine, has confounded the lower courts since Ballentine and those problems are reflected in the divergent accounts of the rule in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.087" offset="13518281">There are more than half a dozen of these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.123" offset="13526431">First, the courts are divided below, as is the Government's brief, about whether the Government's rule applies to all procedural issues or only to procedural issues that arise before the court reaches the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.347" offset="13575333">For example, in -- in Hopkins v. MSPB, after the court had resolved the merits, there was a dispute about counsel fees and an argument that the counsel fee application was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.787" offset="13613053">The Government took the position that that timeliness issue belonged in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.356" offset="13631339">Secondly, the lower courts are divided as is the Government's brief about whether a procedural issue that is related to or intertwined with the merits goes to the district court or the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.181" offset="13686614">There is a line of cases holding that a -- a -- when the MSPB holds there is no jurisdiction because the discrimination claim is frivolous, that's a procedural jurisdiction issue, it's not a merits issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.008" offset="13737919">And if you look at the opinion in Hill v. Department of the Air Force, you see a lengthy description of Title VII law, in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, in the course of a decision by the Federal Circuit holding there is no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.581" offset="13792253">Third, it is unclear what constitutes the line between a merits decision and a procedural decision issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.187" offset="13822660">Some things are really neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.303" offset="13831124">For example, there are recurring disputes about whether a settlement was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.691" offset="13852649">Well, it's not the merits of the discrimination case, but it's not procedural in any normal sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.178" offset="13878667">Fourth, there are cases which involve several claims resolved on several different bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.165" offset="13902595">We noted some of them in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.851" offset="13909282">One -- one claim was rejected on jurisdictional grounds; one claim was rejected on res judicata and one claim was decided by the board on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.456" offset="13943764">Unclear how that would go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.658" offset="13952541">There are also situations in which two cases get filed, one of which -- and they are related cases, and they go to the same judge, and one -- one involved an MSPB decision on procedural grounds, one on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.966" offset="14001755">The court in that case just thought it ought to just keep them both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.168" offset="14014608">It's not clear how that comes out.</text>
