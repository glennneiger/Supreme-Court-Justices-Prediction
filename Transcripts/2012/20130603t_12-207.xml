            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">I'll describe that dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.862" offset="132848">The Court's opinion barely mentions the crucial fact about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.047" offset="153642">The search here was entirely suspicionless.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.053" offset="169629">The police had no reason at all to believe that King's DNA would link him to any crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.124" offset="197945">In approving that suspicion a search, the Court has cast aside a bedrock rule of our Fourth Amendment law that the government may not search its citizens for evidence of crime unless there is reasonable cause to believe that such evidence will be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.485" offset="275372">The men who wrote and ratified that amendment had come to know well what it was like to live under a regime that did not obey this principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.845" offset="312780">Whenever we have allowed suspicionless searches, we have insisted upon a justifying motive apart from mere investigation of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.583" offset="355725">Our cases call those exceptional searches special needs searches, an example being the drug testing of train engineers for public safety purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.986" offset="405358">It is perfectly obvious that no special need, no non-investigative motive justified the swabbing of King's cheek.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.220" offset="442347">The purpose was to learn whether King had committed an unsolved crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.702" offset="468261">A fact the Court does mention often is that King was under arrest when his DNA was taken, but that is quite irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.467" offset="503265">The state's accusations do not suddenly render a man stranger to the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.967" offset="529283">And the limited circumstances in which we have permitted searches of arrestees do not support what the Court does today.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.165" offset="562092">The fact of an arrest will allow a brief search for weapons, but that is a type of a special need search, a matter of officer's safety, not crime solving.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.937" offset="609217">And if the police believe that an arrestee has evidence relevant to his crime of arrest, they may search him for it, but that is not a suspicionless search.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.099" offset="649864">We have never held, however, that arrestees maybe subjected to general suspicionless searches simply because that would be useful to solve unrelated crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.369" offset="698870">That is a terrifying principle, too much in the end even for today's majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.184" offset="726141">So after genuflecting to King's arrestee status, the Court dedicates nearly all of its opinion to a different argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.940" offset="761145">King's DNA was taken, we are told, to identify him.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.276" offset="786536">That assertion taxes the credulity of the credulous unless what the Court means is that taking King's DNA identified him in the sense of enabling the police to learn what crimes he had committed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.625" offset="843901">But that sort of identification is just another way of describing the police's ordinary interest in solving crimes which is never enough to permit a suspicionless search.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.013" offset="889459">We would never, for example, permit the police to search every lawfully stopped car in hopes of turning up evidence of unrelated crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.418" offset="927075">But doing so, would identify the driver in the question-begging sense the Court uses the word today, that is in the sense that it would tell whether he was committing or had committed some other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.149" offset="982037">In the ordinary sense of the term identification, the sense in which we all use it, the DNA search here did not and could not have identified King for a host of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.583" offset="1043790">First, the Maryland statute forbids it.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.322" offset="1058732">It sets forth several permissible purposes for DNA testing, chief among them being investigation of crime, but while it permits DNA testing to identify missing persons and to identity human remains, it nowhere mentions identification of arrestees.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.065" offset="1137727">Moreover, under Maryland law, the DNA testing cannot even begin until the arrestees' first appearance in court which makes a hash out of the Court's theory that DNA could be used to set bail and once the testing does begin it is far too slow to be used for identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.873" offset="1220901">It took months to process King's DNA sample.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.094" offset="1237828">By the time, and not because of some mistake, it typically takes months in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.959" offset="1261234">By the time it was done, his first trial was nearly over and the case was titled State versus King, not State versus John Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.950" offset="1305224">And when the sample was finally processed, it was not used to confirm King's identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.291" offset="1334585">Instead of being checked against the DNA samples of known convicts and arrestees which would have identified him, King's sample was compared against DNA of unknown individuals, taken from unsolved crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.065" offset="1409714">That is perfectly sensible if one wants to solve those crimes, but it is baffling if one wants to identify someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.011" offset="1445449">In fact, when King's DNA was entered into the collection of arrestee DNA samples, it was entered along with information identifying him.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.325" offset="1494768">So, that if the DNA matched that from an unsolved crime, they would know whom to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.278" offset="1518488">In other words, the entire design of the database assumes that the identity of arrestees will already be known.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.882" offset="1560910">The Court's comparisons to fingerprinting and other booking procedures can see that only if the reader knows no more than today's opinion chooses to tell him about how these DNA searches really work.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.450" offset="1619216">An arrestee can be fingerprinted in moments and results come back virtually instantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.390" offset="1642935">The fingerprint database, unlike the DNA database for unsolved crimes, contains detailed identification information.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.982" offset="1677312">And while Maryland waited three days after his arrest as its law required to begin testing King's DNA, I doubt very much that they waited that long to ask his name or to take his fingerprints.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.405" offset="1734990">Fingerprinting in short really is used to identify arrestees.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.860" offset="1756829">It does the job so well, in fact, that there would be no need for a separate wholly redundant confirmation of the same information using DNA. What DNA adds is the ability to solve crimes, nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.971" offset="1821299">That is certainly a noble objective, but not one that can justify a suspicionless search.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.425" offset="1851079">The Court's opinion minimizes the seriousness of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.941" offset="1865185">It is not as intrusive, the opinion says as would be a suspicionless search of the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.088" offset="1893815">That is a curious view of the Fourth Amendment which lists the entities protected against unreasonable searches in the following order; persons, houses, papers, and effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.821" offset="1948672">A search of the person is the most offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.459" offset="1963301">I would not want to have been the royal officer charged with swabbing the cheek of Patrick Henry and while minimizing the intrusiveness of the search, the Court's opinion exaggerates its benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.014" offset="2025472">The DNA testing, the Court tells us, “May have the salutary effect of freeing a person wrongfully imprisoned for the same effect -- for the same offense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="491.987" offset="2073328">That is quite impossible since the DNA database with which King's DNA was compared contains DNA connected from unsolved crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.133" offset="2117945">Persons are wrongfully imprisoned only for solved crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.939" offset="2141142">To assess the benefits of this search, one also must realize that there is no problem once the individual has been convicted of then taking his DNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.816" offset="2200701">The Fourth Amendment rights of that person convicted are less.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.640" offset="2220032">That is one of the consequences of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.775" offset="2232571">So, what that means is that the only thing achieved by today's opinion is that people who are wrongfully arrested or at least arrested for a crime that they are not convicted of will be subject to DNA testing.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.798" offset="2312610">If they're convicted, there's no problem about using it.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.617" offset="2327865">It's only the innocent arrestees.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.212" offset="2346256">The Court attempts to disguise the vast scope of today's holding by promising to limit it to those who have been arrested for what it calls serious offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.602" offset="2399859">That line lacks any principle basis and will not last.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.602" offset="2419816">If you believe that a DNA search will identify someone arrested for bank robbery, you must believe that it will identify someone arrested for running a red light.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.118" offset="2457851">To decide otherwise would require the sort of senseless distinctions that this Court is not accustomed to make, is not supposed to make if there is any difference between prescribing legal rules willy-nilly and deciding what an existing legal principle requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.011" offset="2529426">In the end, logic will out.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.351" offset="2542801">Make no mistake about it because of today's decision, your DNA can be taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested rightly or wrongly and for whatever reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.645" offset="2599957">This will solve some extra crimes to be sure but so would taking your DNA whenever you fly on an airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.834" offset="2632767">Surely the TSA must know the identity of the flying public. For that matter, so would taking your children's DNA when they start public school.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.415" offset="2675085">It maybe wise as the Court obviously believes to make the leviathan all seeing so that he may protect us all the better, but the proud men who wrote the charter of our liberties would not have been so eager to open their mouths for royal inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.314" offset="2750631">I respectfully dissent.</text>
