            <text syncTime="13.824" offset="161285">Congress's comprehensive program to address the worldwide problem of HIV and AIDS includes a policy of opposing prostitution and sex trafficking because they contribute to the diseases spread.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.298" offset="203186">And correspondingly, Congress determined -- determined that the government should partner with and should grant limited competitive Federal funding to those organizations that agree with the policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking, because organizations that agree with that policy are most likely to carry out the Federal program in conformity with the Federal policy priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.795" offset="289181">Now, no organization that carries out HIV programming is required to subscribe to the Federal government's views, but if an organization wants to partner with the Federal government and get Federal funds to carry out the Federal program, well, that organization--</text>

            <text syncTime="59.636" offset="344456">Well, but I guess the problem is that there are a number of different ways you could carry out the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.005" offset="357935">And let's say you have an organization that focuses on a particular -- you know, the administration of hospitals or whatever it is that's covered by the program, and they regard this issue as collateral to what they're concerned with.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.024" offset="474023">And I think what one can do is look at Respondents' brief, because Respondents encompass a variety of different types of organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.011" offset="497951">But Respondents' brief itself tells you, at pages 11 to 12 and at pages 32 and 33, that there are going to be situations, in their own experience, in which these issues about prostitution and--</text>

            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>
            <text syncTime="130.014" offset="626056">Mr. Chief Justice, I think that would present a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.315" offset="639221">Of course, you know that it presents a different question, but it would be a little bit more difficult for the -- for the following reason: That there is a germaneness component to Congress's -- the constitutionality of Congress's funding decisions in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.523" offset="684048">And the more sweeping and the less germane the condition would be, the more it's open to constitutional attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.508" offset="704005">Now, this condition is very, very germane, because as -- because as Congress found, prostitution and sex trafficking contribute to the spread of the disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.264" offset="735039">And so it makes good sense that Congress would have imposed this condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.216" offset="746846">And I think it's important to understand--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="161.449" offset="751757">Well -- well, it would on that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.101" offset="758340">What should we do -- as far as I can tell from the briefs, the people who work with the prostitutes to try to prevent AIDS uniformly tell us that if you go to those prostitutes and you try to get them to take steps to stop AIDS, it's very hard to do if at the same time you've announced you're against all prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.431" offset="843708">So what they're saying is that the condition imposed will interfere with the objective, and if there is a germaneness requirement -- and nobody says the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.070" offset="890206">I mean, I've noted nobody denies what they're saying in terms of the effectiveness of their work, so -- I don't think.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.843" offset="921344">At least, I didn't read them all with great care; maybe you can point to somebody who does.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.711" offset="936808">But if everyone is telling us that this is counterproductive and the exact opposite, then can we say, well, it isn't germane.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>
            <text syncTime="217.485" offset="975888">--Well, Justice Breyer, I don't think so, and two responses on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.537" offset="988113">First of all, everybody is not telling you that, and I'll tell you who's not telling you that in a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.239" offset="1002950">But the more -- but the overarching point is that this is a policy determination that Congress, of course, took into account when it fashioned the statute, and it concluded that it was important to have an opposition to prostitution and sex trafficking.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.528" offset="1044119">Now, as far as the organizations that aren't telling you that, there is an amicus brief that's filed by 46 organizations that it's in our support--</text>

            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>
            <text syncTime="242.251" offset="1074944">--that's in our support, and the lead organization is the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, and they -- they support us.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.188" offset="1098663">And they think that the best way -- and they -- and they argued this passionately in their brief -- they think that the best way to provide services to the target audience is under a rubric of opposition to prostitution and sex trafficking.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.495" offset="1143907">And I would urge you to take a look at that brief, because it explains why the program should be conducted in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.883" offset="1165537">Now, is there a debate about--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="266.149" offset="1170552">Mr. Srinivasan, there isn't -- at least I'm not familiar with anything quite like this where if you're not told, if you want to run a government program, you have to speak the government's speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.159" offset="1226559">This doesn't require the recipient to speak to anybody at all, except to the government itself, to say, I pledge that my policy is the government's policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.402" offset="1283610">So it's making somebody adopt as her own the government's policy rather than saying, I understand that I get my government money, I have to follow the government's rules about what I can say to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.945" offset="1353723">Here -- and is -- is there anything else quite like this where you make a pledge to the government, but with respect to third parties doesn't apply?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sri_srinivasan" startTime="323.586" stopTime="411.643">
            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>
            <text syncTime="323.586" offset="1400325">--Justice Ginsburg, if I could just fight the premise of your question just very slightly and then explain why I think this kind of requirement makes sense in this particular context.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.341" offset="1431359">The goal of this is not to persuade somebody to change their view.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.460" offset="1443793">The goal of this is to partner with organizations that self-identify as organizations that agree with the government's policy priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.781" offset="1469079">And the reason the government has done that, and the reason why Congress could -- felt that that was a good idea is straightforward, and that is that those organizations that agree with Congress's policy priorities are going to be more likely to be reliable and effective partners in carrying out the government's program.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.457" offset="1523832">And one way to think about it is to envision this: You have a circumstance in which you're down to your last few dollars of a discretionary Federal funding and you're looking at two different organizations that are competing for that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.830" offset="1561239">One of them comes to you and says, we agree with your policy of an opposition to prostitution and sex trafficking, and the other one says, we're not going to tell you whether we agree; we're going to remain studiously neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.120" offset="1606483">But we'll tell you that we'll conduct our affairs in a manner that's not inconsistent with your policy priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.424" offset="1627695">I think it makes all the sense in the world for Congress to decide that the government should preferably partner with the former organization rather than the latter, because they're going to be more reliable and more effective at carrying out the government's program.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.564" offset="1672208">And there's another aspect of this that I think that is important to highlight, and that is that we're not just talking about circumstances in which the conduct is -- is arguably going to be neutral, so that there's going to be no position taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.605" offset="1712332">There's also going to be occasions in which the organizations that are providing services are going to have the opportunity to affirmatively embrace the government's policy in opposition to prostitution and sex trafficking.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.426" offset="1955688">One is that Finley talked about, and I think it captures some other decisions in this -- this respect, disallowing the government from leveraging its control over funding conditions in a manner that services a speech-suppressive objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="726.148" offset="3010513">What Congress wanted to do is secure an ex ante commitment from the organizations with which the government works to assure that they agreed with the government's policy priorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.309" offset="3091179">And that monitoring is made all the more challenging because these issues can come into play through a myriad of interactions between the organizations that are working with the government and local communities and local officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="763.187" offset="3158679">And then it seems to me that the case that Justice Ginsburg was speaking of is pretty relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.393" offset="3195564">Well, that case, Regan and League of Women Voters, all seem quite comparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.798" offset="3225135">They are trying to balance the -- the desire of the government to further a policy objective with the undesirability of the government invading what would otherwise be a constitutional protected right to speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.808" offset="3285217">And the way they have done it is quite technical and narrow, but it may be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.196" offset="3306741">In both, what they said was: Don't worry about your protected speech as much as you are because there is another way you can do it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.335" offset="3351254">You go through a -- an independent structured organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.927" offset="3717700">The point of it is to get to this leveraging purpose that I was talking about earlier, and it's to show that what the government is doing is keeping the condition within its appropriate confines, and it's not allowing that condition to spread beyond that into other realms.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.254" offset="3770990">And that purpose is fully served by the organizational affiliate alternative here.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.541" offset="3808083">Most of those separate affiliates was in Taxation Without Representation and it was the cure for the Legal of Women Voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.199" offset="3858761">But here, as the D.C. district court said in its opinion, which was in your favor: Oh, all you have to do is spin off a subsidiary that gets the government money; it's just a simple matter of corporate reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.928" offset="3937651">But you know that getting an NGO, a new NGO, recognized in dozens of foreign countries is no simple thing to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.753" offset="3988955">I mean, to take a concrete example, look what happened about a year and a half ago in Egypt when the U.S. NGO's were indicted for criminal -- for not complying with the permit requirements of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.864" offset="4049455">So it's one thing to set up a 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) operating in the United States, each does its thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.368" offset="4083414">But to require an NGO to then in the countries where it's operating get the necessary permits is quite an arduous thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1010.647" offset="4148511">I mean, of course, the recipient organization that's been conducting the program to date can continue to conduct the program and the affiliate that's set up could be the alternate channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.353" offset="4187381">And so you could run in the opposite direction and I think you wouldn't run into that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.805" offset="4201174">But I would like to address on this score an important point, which is that I think Respondents have suggested that there is a material distinction between, Justice Breyer, the circumstances in Rust and the circumstances in this case, because Rust involves separate programs within a legal entity, and this case involves separate organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.682" offset="4272645">And I think the point the Respondents are trying to make is that there is a distinction because at least there one legal entity could have multiple programs, some of which are subject to the condition and some of which are not, whereas here there is a difference because this condition applies to an entire organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.255" offset="4410990">Because when A says “ I believe in X ” and then they set up a separate structure -- and every one knows they have set it up; I mean, that's the point of it -- and the structure says, “ just kidding ”, nobody believes them from day one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.585" offset="4492283">And so you can't do it and if the government has its way and has awarded the thing properly, according to your criteria, the part that won't be believed is the “ just kidding ” part.</text>

            <text syncTime="3383.308" offset="13639215">But I don't think that effort is to try to change their viewpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.093" offset="13650291">It's to try to get them to self -- self-identify that they are going to be reliable in carrying out the government program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.981" offset="13669830">Justice Kennedy, you'd asked the question about whether the foreign context matters, and I talked about why it matters in the sense that monitoring can be challenging in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.600" offset="13704312">It also matters in another sense that I should add, which is that when the organizations are doing this work in those areas, they are identified as working with the United States government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.708" offset="13744750">There is a statutory provision at 291(a) of the petition appendix, which is 22 U.S.C. 7611(h), and that requires the global AIDS coordinator to develop a message that enhances awareness by program recipients that the program is an effort on behalf of the citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.552" offset="13804204">So there is a real perception out there that when the organization is carrying out its functions, it's doing so at the behest of the United States citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.722" offset="13832834">And part of what Congress wanted to do was to avoid a misimpression about why -- about what the United States' policy priorities are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.544" offset="13860106">And one way to do that is to assure that the organizations with which the United States works share the United States' policy commitment against prostitution and sex trafficking.</text>
