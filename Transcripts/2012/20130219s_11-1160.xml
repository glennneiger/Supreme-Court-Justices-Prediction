            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Sotomayor has our opinion this morning in case 11-1160, Federal Trade Commission versus Phoebe Putney Health System.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="8.237" offset="139410">This Court has recognized that the federal antitrust laws do not prevent states from imposing market restraints as an act of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.689" offset="185177">This case concerns a scope of that state action immunity doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.346" offset="203880">In Georgia, towns and counties may create special-purpose public entities called hospital authorities to provide hospital services to residents on a non-profit basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.375" offset="251946">Georgia law gives these authorities numerous general powers including the power to acquire in these hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.763" offset="285487">The hospital authority of the city of Albany and Dougherty County owns Memorial Hospital which is one of two hospitals in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.826" offset="325716">The authority leases Memorial to a private non-profit company which manages Memorial's day-to-day operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.753" offset="357480">In 2010, the authority approved a plan to acquire the second hospital in the county until lease it to a corporate affiliate of the company that operates Memorial.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.633" offset="400948">The Federal Trade Commission or FTC filed an administrative complaint and then sought a preliminary injunction arguing that the planned acquisition would substantially reduce competition in the market for hospital services in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act and Sections -- Section -- Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.088" offset="490809">The District Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction and dismissed the FTCs claims on the ground that the authority and the other parties to the transaction were entitled to antitrust immunity under the state action doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.349" offset="555802">The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.381" offset="563952">The Court reasoned that Georgia's legislature must have foreseen that the grant of power to hospital authorities to acquire and lease hospitals would produce anticompetitive effects because acquisitions could consolidate ownership of competing hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.366" offset="635946">We grant a certiorari and now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.834" offset="649738">Under our precedent, a local governmental entity, like the authority is entitled to immunity only if it acts pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy to displace competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.483" offset="716403">We have applied that just practically recognizing that state legislatures do not typically catalogue all of the anticipated effects of a statute delegating authority to a local governmental entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.035" offset="774604">But because state action immunity is disfavored, we have also applied the test rigorously insisting that the challenged anticompetitive effects must have been affirmatively contemplated by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.342" offset="835835">Thus, we have found the state policy to displace federal antitrust laws as sufficiently expressed in cases where the displacement of competition was the inherent logical or ordinary result of the exercise of authority delegated by the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.074" offset="914725">In that scenario, we have concluded that a state must have foreseen an implicitly endorsed the anticompetitive effects as consistent with its policy goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.786" offset="961640">Here, there is no evidence that Georgia affirmatively contemplated that hospital authorities would displace competition by consolidating hospital ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.313" offset="1003645">The acquisition of leasing powers exercised by the authority in the challenge transaction, mirror general powers routinely conferred by state law upon private corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.460" offset="1056308">Such general grants of power should be, can be, and typically are used in ways that raise no federal antitrust concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.916" offset="1098104">In concluding, otherwise, the Court of Appeals applied the concept of foreseeability from our clear articulation test too loosely.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.363" offset="1135929">While it is always possible that a local governmental entity might exercise general powers in anticompetitive ways, a reasonable legislature's ability to foresee that possibility fells -- falls well short of clearly articulating an affirmative state policy to displace competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.603" offset="1224850">Respondents insist that Georgia law does more than give hospital authority's permission to play in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.352" offset="1251809">They contend that because hospital authorities are granted unique powers and responsibilities to fulfill the state's objective of providing residents with the access to adequate and affordable hospital care.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.898" offset="1306039">The State must have anticipated that the authorities would decide to acquire additional local hospitals to increase their capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.008" offset="1346476">But for reasons discussed in the opinion, we find nothing in Georgia law that clearly articulates a state policy to let hospital authorities exercise their acquisition power without regard to negative effects on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.700" offset="1417216">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.651" offset="1433098">The decision of the Court is unanimous.</text>
