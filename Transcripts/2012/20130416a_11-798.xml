            <text syncTime="8.856" offset="143371">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.276" offset="173046">This case is about the plain text of the FAAAA express preemption clause and the continuing vitality of this Court's decision in Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.817" offset="215156">I'd like to start by showing why the Port's requirements here fall within the text of the statute and cannot be saved by any market participant exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.837" offset="247234">The FAAAA provides that no State or political subdivision of a State may enact or enforce any law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to rates, routes, and services of a motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.764" offset="307002">The only statutory language at issue here is the force and effect of law requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.401" offset="325497">And the Port's actions have the force and effect of law under any reasonable interpretation of the phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.389" offset="349425">The Port is imposing binding standards of conduct on motor carriers as a condition of accessing a channel of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.894" offset="379518">The Port is enforcing those requirements through criminal penalties--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="71.179" offset="392579">I thought that the Port said we don't apply criminal penalties which come from the tariff, we don't apply those to licensed motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.502" offset="437928">They made that representation, so I think we have to accept that as being so.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_n_lerman" startTime="87.289" stopTime="140.007">
            <label>Mr. Daniel N. Lerman</label>
            <text syncTime="87.289" offset="457049">--They -- they did make that representation and we could accept that, but it's irrelevant because the Port is still imposing the criminal penalties on the terminal operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.228" offset="488814">And when a State is imposing criminal penalties, that is classic governmental action, the State acting in its sovereign capacity, regardless of whom the penalties are imposed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.767" offset="530924">And in this Court's decision in Roe, it made clear that States could regulate trucking activity through penalties, in that case civil penalties, imposed only on people who do business with truckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.958" offset="571779">Here, the State's requirements are coming at the truckers from both ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.510" offset="585885">On the one end, you have the criminal penalties imposed on the terminal operators to coerce their conduct and exclude truckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.347" offset="613262">On the other hand, you have the tariff which puts conditions on access to the Port of Los Angeles, which is a key channel of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.020" offset="643982">So the Port's requirements here have the force and effect of law in spades, because using--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="140.007" offset="667910">Can I break down your arguments into two components, if you might?</text>
            <text syncTime="144.242" offset="684837">Whether or not the market participant exception exists at all; and if it does, how far does it go?</text>
            <text syncTime="152.814" offset="719110">So, let's get to the first question in my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.552" offset="738127">Seems almost impossible for me to believe that the States couldn't require someone to put a little placard like you get at the -- at almost any building that you go into to park your car.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.578" offset="802179">They ask you to put a little placard in the front of your window so they know who you are and where you're going in the Port, okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="182.351" offset="837288">Why is the placard requirement here any different than that requirement generally?</text>
            <text syncTime="189.856" offset="867276">Because if you enter property, you have -- most people tell you put a placard in the window to tell us you got permission to come in.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.193" offset="896638">--It's -- it's different in this case, Your Honor, because -- in addition to the overlay that 14506 specifically targets identification requirements, and -- and for purposes of this case, it's -- but I understand--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="207.482" offset="937807">But even if that, if we didn't have a market participant, why couldn't the State say: When you come into the terminal, you just got to put a little placard in so we know that you're not parking here overnight when you've already been unloaded or something else?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_n_lerman" startTime="220.222" stopTime="234.399">
            <label>Mr. Daniel N. Lerman</label>
            <text syncTime="220.222" offset="988798">--I think you need to look to the particulars of this case, and the -- and the fact is that the placard requirement here is codified into an ordinance, it's backed by criminal penalties, and it's restricting access to a channel of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.930" offset="1031639">Because we have all those factors here, it has the force and effect of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.399" offset="1045536">Could the terminal say, we have a pollution problem and only modern trucks can come and unload here?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel N. Lerman</label>
            <text syncTime="253.280" offset="1120978">Heavy is a different scenario, Justice Sotomayor, because there's an express exception to the FAAAA for weight and size restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.283" offset="1148981">So Congress carved out a series of exceptions for the FAAAA for safety requirements, which gets to part of your question, for height and weight and size limits, for requirements pertaining to the transport of nonconsensual goods and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.841" offset="1195270">It did not create a proprietary exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.026" offset="1204047">So a lot of Your Honor's concerns may well be covered by one of these other exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.161" offset="1220556">But there is no exception for a proprietary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.130" offset="1236439">If it has the force and effect of law and it does not fall within one of the enumerated exceptions to the statute, then it is preempted under the terms that Congress used.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.259" offset="1316896">Yes, that's quite right, and precisely because that statute contained an exception and this Court has recognized that when Congress enacted the FAAAA, it copied the ADA, and it copied the express preemption clause, but it -- Congress chose not to include that proprietary exception.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="317.219" stopTime="327.344">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="317.219" offset="1376769">Do we know why, why Congress had a different regulation for ports and for airfields?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel N. Lerman</label>
            <text syncTime="327.344" offset="1417311">I don't believe the record -- the legislative history doesn't show why.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.146" offset="1432462">But Congress thought, clearly copied the statute and made the decision not to include it.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.200" offset="1452733">So by the terms of the statute, Congress wrote a statute that preempts any action with the force and effect of law, and it chose not to carve out an exception for proprietary action which, as you say, Your Honor, was included in the Airline Deregulation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.107" offset="1500276">So that just lends added force to the argument that the Act here does not contain an unstated exception, an exception that Congress has created not only for the ADA, which is the express model for this Act, but in a host of other statutes where Congress carved out specific exceptions for proprietary actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.213" offset="1652726">--That's correct, Your Honor, it was implied preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.832" offset="1659205">There was no express preemption clause to construe, and that language is in the context of an implied preemption case.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.053" offset="1680102">Here, as Justice Scalia notes, we have an express preemption clause, and we have a clause that has carveouts for a lot of things, but it does not have a carveout for proprietary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.092" offset="1720227">And that is -- that is the best evidence as Congress has intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.127" offset="1732452">This Court has stated, when there's an express preemption clause, the plain language of the clause defines the scope of Congress's intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.867" offset="1759410">And here the plain meaning of the clause covers actions as here that are backed by criminal penalties and impose conditions of access to a key channel of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.805" offset="1795146">That is the very definition of force and effect of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.674" offset="1806640">The Port is invoking the full coercive power of the State to impose conditions on motor carriers, and that is exactly what Congress sought to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.261" offset="1836942">Congress sought to prevent State actions that impede the free flow of trade or that would result in a patchwork of requirements from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.284" offset="1869020">That is what the Port's doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.967" offset="1875812">It -- it conflicts with Congress's objectives and it falls within the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.271" offset="1892948">And it cannot be saved by virtue of a market participant exception that, by Respondent's own admission, is untethered from the text of the statute itself for the reasons that we've discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.210" offset="1932759">Congress made quite clear what it wanted to except from the broad scope of preemption, and this Court has reinforced the breadth of preemption, and did not include--</text>

            <text syncTime="997.220" offset="4096742">The Port argued for that here and the district court rejected it on the record after hearing testimony about the alleged safety and hazardous cargo justifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.557" offset="4126104">They didn't make an argument under sizes and weights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.259" offset="4136971">Presumably, they could make that record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.611" offset="4146375">You'd have to see about the strength of their justifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.428" offset="4153585">I'd note that I -- it would probably be the case they would have to apply uniformly to trucks of a given size or weights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.548" offset="4178140">Here, they were only going after drayage trucks, which are a particular category of trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.601" offset="4194336">I don't know if they could make that showing with respect to all trucks or if that was their intent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.970" offset="4207815">I would like to turn, if I could, to Justice Ginsburg's question about the criminal penalties in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.691" offset="4226623">We accept the Port's statement in their brief on face value that the criminal penalties would only fall on the marine terminal operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.778" offset="4255045">But, like Petitioner, we don't think that makes a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.397" offset="4265493">If, for example, the State Highway Commission said, okay, certain trucks can't use our roads unless you sign a certain agreement, but don't worry, if you don't agree to abide by that agreement we won't do anything to you, but we will throw every person who does business with you in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.240" offset="4324844">Whatever else you could say about that scheme, I think it would be pretty clear that it would be the act of a sovereign and so it would have the force and effect of law within the meaning of this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.897" offset="4375521">In other words, if the Port did this all through contract, basically said to each terminal operator, look, if you contract with truckers that don't have this concession agreement, we are going to charge you a higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.624" offset="4430378">So -- so if the criminal penalties were not in the case, is there enough here to still make this the force and effect of law?</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.496" offset="4465905">We think not only is there enough here, but there's another sort of a bright-line rationale before you get into the Boston Harbor sort of understanding of if this is regulatory or market participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.435" offset="4501640">And that's the second factor we cite in our brief, which is we don't consider the Port the equivalent of the cement factory in Reeves, like a commercial enterprise that you might see in the private marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.641" offset="4538421">This port authority, like I think virtually all other port authorities in charge of these massive container ports, hold land much like a highway commission in trust for the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1119.531" offset="4586068">If you look at all the different metrics of success the court of appeals pointed to and the district court pointed to and I think the port points to in their brief, they are not bottom line business metrics like shareholder value and dividends and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.006" offset="4635910">It's economic vitality of the region.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.229" offset="4680840">I mean, a commercial enterprise might want to attract customers because of its reputation as a -- as a green company, because of its reputation of hiring local workers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.346" offset="4777285">But I think what this Court said in Boston Harbor was that, yeah, a private business could boycott labor law -- law violators too, and, in a sense, the private business would be engaged in quote-unquote regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.235" offset="4820857">But when the Government does that, when the Government uses its special place in society and its enormous economic power to effectively leverage its power to impose regulation, that's -- that's fundamentally different, and that is not the Government acting in a market capacity even though, sure, Wal-Mart or Starbucks could do a similar thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.658" offset="4958574">I mean, our first order argument is criminal penalties and just the nature of a port and -- the Port doesn't contract with the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.161" offset="4984592">The Port is a department of the city, and its members are appointed by the mayor and its revisions to the tariff are codified in city ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.917" offset="5015521">So it's in every way a part of the city, it's not just a contractual relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.352" offset="5029314">We think just the criminal penalties here and the nature of what a port is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.671" offset="5046555">A port -- a regulatory body that governs a critical part of public infrastructure is enough to resolve this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.741" offset="5070901">If you think no, the criminal penalties don't matter and this Port is more like the cement factory in Reeves, it's really just a plain vanilla commercial enterprise, we do think the fact that it's leveraging significant economic power, that it's the only place in L.A. to do this business, is part of this sort of Gould market participant analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2382.089" offset="9636269">We submit that force and effect of law almost invites a market participant analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.560" offset="9658107">Let me also respond to your point about the ADA, the Airport Deregulation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.564" offset="9686111">The reason there is a limited exception for airport proprietors, as this Court has held, is because there was a longstanding issue about airports being able to impose restrictions about noise pollution on surrounding communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.776" offset="9759045">Congress was well aware back in the 1970s, when this statute was enacted, of that controversy and they wanted to preserve of the existing rights of airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.316" offset="9801154">There is no comparable controversy with respect to truck ports or ports or the Government that was ongoing in 1994 when this particular statute was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.176" offset="9860609">But let me point out that what did -- did occur in 1994 was that Congress was writing against the backdrop of this Court's decision in the Boston Harbor case, in which Congress was told that in the absence of something express, which says that a city or State can't manage its own property when it pursues its proprietary interests, that there would not be inferred -- not be inferred -- a restriction on a State's power to manage its own property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.747" offset="9998849">So, unlike the situation when the ADA was adopted, when the FAAAA was adopted in 1994, there was, we submit, a background principle, which this Court had enunciated earlier, that there was a presumption that our proprietary powers were to be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.430" offset="10085575">If -- if I can, I'd like to go on to the Castle argument as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.201" offset="10116713">Our point -- we make three different points in Castle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.004" offset="10139910">First of all, our position is that the Castle decision was predicated upon a very specific statutory regime that existed in -- under the Federal Motor Carrier Act of 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.484" offset="10213784">Justice Black specifically noted the details of that statutory regime, which included certificates of convenience and necessity, very precise rules under which trucks were to operate within -- within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.631" offset="10294450">That regime has died.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.397" offset="10305526">Died several decades ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.983" offset="10315871">And we would submit that the Castle doctrine as it existed died with that regime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.228" offset="13328834">Secondly, we submit you cannot be the owner-proprietor of property without having some control over the conditions under which owner -- under which invitees, business invitees, come onto your property; that this statute of Congress was not intended to constrain that property interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.684" offset="13982627">Justice Ginsburg, the concession agreements gives the Port unfettered discretion to determine whether or not to suspend or revoke access.</text>
