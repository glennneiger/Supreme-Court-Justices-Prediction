            <text syncTime="153.527" offset="721087">But the two responses this Court has always pointed to is the restraint on resources and the check of community hostility.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.997" offset="746896">Here, the police were combatting a serious epidemic of grow houses, hundreds of houses each year that were a scourge to the community, not only in terms just of the drugs that they were growing--</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.962" offset="4546771">In the brief in opposition to cert, Respondent said that the police could approach the front door for a knock and talk, and made no separate argument about the dog's presence there making it not lawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.480" offset="5292829">So it's not just that you want to keep something private; it's that you need to have a legitimate expectation that you can keep that private.</text>
