            <text syncTime="10.072" offset="145838">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.758" offset="160571">The issue is whether temporary flooding can ever constitute a taking under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.927" offset="185230">The Federal Circuit said, no, never, ruling that the permanent consequences of the Government's actions were not relevant solely because its actions were not permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.610" offset="232042">Respectfully, Your Honors, that cannot be the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.217" offset="246461">There are at least two reasons why.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.514" offset="255656">First, the United States must provide just compensation when its direct physical invasion substantially intrudes upon a landowner's protected property interest, regardless of the particular mode or duration of that invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.899" offset="313126">And, second, the Federal Circuit's decision conflicts with fundamental guarantees that the Takings Clause is intended to preserve, and, therefore, is manifestly unjust.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="63.082" offset="357847">What about this Court's precedent in, what is it, the Sanguinetti case, where the Court said that for there to be government responsibility it is at least necessary that the overflow constitute a permanent invasion of the land amounting to an appropriation, not merely an injury, to property?</text>
            <text syncTime="88.916" offset="461188">We would have to withdraw or modify that statement, would we not, if you -- if your -- your argument prevails?</text>

            <text syncTime="97.815" offset="496819">Justice Ginsburg, we would say that you would not have to overrule Sanguinetti because the language there, “ permanent flooding invasion ”, was -- was not how the case turned on the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.449" offset="555333">The Court there did make an inaccurate summary of the early flood-taking cases -- Pumpelly, Lynah, and Kress.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.838" offset="588874">None of those cases said that flooding had to be permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.476" offset="603503">The facts in those cases did have a permanent condition of flooding, but that was not made a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.240" offset="634536">And none of those cases said that you could not have temporary flood invasions.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.947" offset="741325">If the latter, that dictum if it's dictum or a holding if it was a holding has already been overruled by our later temporary takings cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.802" offset="804750">The Court there didn't have occasion to address temporary flooding, whether that could constitute a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.956" offset="829410">And all of the cases after Sanguinetti that have actually addressed whether a direct temporary invasion will -- that substantially intrudes upon property interests have held that, yes, you can have a temporary--</text>

            <text syncTime="196.761" offset="892626">Because I counted eleven cases which either say, state, some seem to hold or support the proposition that when it's temporary with a flood it's a trespass, and where it's permanent it's a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.331" offset="954902">Okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="213.318" offset="958873">I mean, I have eleven.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.986" offset="997534">You could argue that there were three cases during the war which might be read that way, though they don't quite mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.932" offset="1037240">So which of the cases that you -- rather than list my eleven, I'm more interested in what you think, and so I'd like to know which are the ones you think support -- with something like a flood, which it's not -- you're not physically taking hold of the whole thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.358" offset="6455036">As has been pointed out, this Court has consistently held in its flooding cases and reaffirmed in Loretto that a taking occurs in the context of flooding only if the flooding is the direct result of the structure itself and if it results in a permanent effect on the property such that it's an actual appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.148" offset="6542180">So--</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.601" offset="6543957">So it's -- there is a little confusion about the Government's position, there was in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.287" offset="6566736">Is it -- I'm quoting from your friend's brief, and he says:</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.894" offset="6589096">"The Federal Circuit adopted a categorical rule that temporary government action can never be a taking if the government does not intend to create a permanent flooding condition. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.187" offset="6634340">Is that an accurate statement of your understanding?</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.088" offset="6645939">--I think the intent point, I guess I would modify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.590" offset="6659940">There are some things that -- I think it would have to be an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.930" offset="6677286">In Dickinson, for example, the modification was intrinsically permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.802" offset="6704767">The landowner had corrected for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.490" offset="6711558">But it was intrinsically permanent until the landowner had done something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.362" offset="6727023">So actually Dickinson is consistent with our -- with our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.285" offset="6742696">But I do want -- there is a critical piece about this case that Justice Kennedy's questions have touched upon that I think it's very important for this Court to focus upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.186" offset="6774252">This case is not about flooding by the project itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.075" offset="6793896">The reservoir behind the dam, the easements, the flowing easements there, the spillway, the project is the Government and I think it's fair to say the Government is occupying the land when the Government builds the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.570" offset="6843842">What we have here are incidental consequences downstream from the dam as a result of the flowage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.596" offset="6871950">And there are -- Loretto, when it is summing up this Court's flooding cases, makes two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.859" offset="6897028">One, it says it has to be permanent, not temporary invasion; but it also distinguishes the category of cases in which there is conduct outside the landowner's property that has consequential damages within the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.934" offset="7109247">Bedford was a situation in which a revetment, as counsel pointed out, a revetment was constructed in the -- in the Mississippi River to protect erosion and access to the City of Vicksburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.444" offset="7159297">It was -- it was clearly shown in that case that over time, over a period of 6 years, as in this case, downstream by 6 miles it resulted in permanent flooding of land as a consequence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.986" offset="7217498">But what the Court said is that is consequential injury downstream; it is not occupation by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.483" offset="7387503">What we're talking about here is the Corps of Engineers operating a dam from which it has to take into account multiple considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.660" offset="7484156">This is why the Federal Government was invited in to construct these projects because along the river there was very serious flooding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.952" offset="7513413">So the Government puts in a dam to control the flooding, it has to release the flood waters, and the timing of the release of the flood waters is something that you have to take into account--</text>
