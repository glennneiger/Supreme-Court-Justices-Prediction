            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">Justice Kagan has our opinion this morning in case 11-798, American Trucking Associations versus The City of Los Angeles.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="9.038" stopTime="268.728">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="9.038" offset="143569">This case concerns the preemption of trucking regulations at the port of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.868" offset="166975">It's our second case this term about the preemptive scope of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act or FAAAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.401" offset="213055">That's quite a lot of A's, so I'm going to call it F4A for short.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.532" offset="233639">The Los Angeles Port is the largest port in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.248" offset="248477">It's run by a Board of Harbor Commissioners under a city ordinance known as a tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.941" offset="271256">The port owns marine terminal facilities which at leases the terminal operators that load and unload cargo from docking ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.366" offset="304901">Short-haul trucks called drayage trucks assist in those operations by moving cargo into and out of the port.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.284" offset="340637">In 2007 and response to neighbors concerns about traffic pollution and safety, the port implemented a clean truck program.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.353" offset="376895">As part of that program, the port developed the standard form agreement containing a number of requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.024" offset="403540">Two of those requirements are important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.856" offset="414929">One requires trucking companies to display a placard on each truck with a phone number for reporting concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.897" offset="443037">The other requires companies to submit an off-street parking plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.532" offset="461636">The other provisions of the agreement deal with things like a company's financial capacity, truck maintenance, and employment of drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.939" offset="495177">To make sure the drayage companies enter into the agreement, the poor amended it's tariff which again, that's municipal law to make it a criminal offense for a terminal operator to grant access to any company that didn't sign the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.562" offset="557767">Each violation is punishable by up to six months in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.470" offset="577306">The petitioner here, American Trucking Association or ATA is a trade group that represents most of the trucking companies at the port.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.924" offset="615131">ATA filed suit arguing primarily that the F4A preempts that is invalidates the placard and parking requirements in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.181" offset="660167">The District Court found out that neither provision was preempted and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.951" offset="683259">Today we reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision and hold that the placard and parking provisions of the agreement are preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.717" offset="714292">The F4A preempts any state or local provision having the force and effect of law that deals with trucking prices, routes, or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.353" offset="752849">That's so those matters are the special providence of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.610" offset="773956">We've held in the past that language of that kind, the force and effect of law language, draws a line between a government's exercise of regulatory authority and its own proprietary participation in a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.317" offset="828709">Actions that fall on the regulatory side of the line are preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.139" offset="848039">The Congress has made a decision that states and localities are not to be involved in those matters, but those on the proprietary side of the line where the state or locality is operating just as a commercial actor would or not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.597" offset="913868">Now, the boundaries of that line might sometimes be fuzzy, but the outcome here is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.254" offset="940513">The port exercise classic regulatory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.167" offset="956186">It forced terminal operators and through them trucking companies to alter their conduct by means of a criminal prohibition backed by the treat of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.274" offset="996519">That counts as action having the force and effect of law if anything does.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.661" offset="1018149">There is also another question in this case whether our decision in a -- in a case called Castle versus Hayes Freight Lines, prevents the port from enforcing other none preemptive provisions of the agreement by borrowing trucks from the port.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.784" offset="1082619">But we decide not to decide that question today.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.200" offset="1096307">The case comes to us in a pre-enforcement posture and on the current record, we cannot tell what the ports enforcement scam really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.471" offset="1133401">We will address that question if and when we have to after the port begins to enforce its agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.472" offset="1161404">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.346" offset="1168823">Justice Thomas has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
