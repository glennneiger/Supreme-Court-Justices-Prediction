            <text syncTime="6.154" offset="130134">Mr. Rothfeld?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="7.237" offset="134523">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.022" offset="145599">In the Red River Compact, Oklahoma agreed that Texas would be allowed to use a specified quantity of water that is located in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.212" offset="182379">Oklahoma is now trying to back out of that bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.263" offset="194604">What its argument to this Court in support of its position is essentially that the Court should disregard language that appears in the Red River Compact because that language is superfluous, that the Court should read into the Compact language that does not appear there, and that the Court should not give the text of the Compact what Oklahoma in its brief describes as talismanic significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.260" offset="278614">Our very different view is that the plain text of the Compact must control.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.647" offset="296064">Now, in the Red River Compact, Texas and Oklahoma, along with Louisiana and Arkansas, agreed to allocate among themselves the waters of the Red River Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.253" offset="334516">The Compact divides that basin into large areas called reaches and subdivides the reaches into subbasins.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.108" offset="365968">As to some of those areas, the Compact expressly allocates entitlement to water by State line.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.179" offset="390209">It says that the States may use the water within their boundaries exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.564" offset="407763">But in the section of the Compact which is at issue here, Reach 2, Subbasin 5, the Compact uses a very different and unique language.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.237" offset="442454">That section -- that subbasin includes the territory of three of the four compacting States.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.093" offset="473906">The boundaries of that subbasin are drawn not by State lines, but by reference to the -- the last downside dam sites before tributaries to the Red River Basin -- Red River flow into the river itself.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="103.900" offset="521135">Mr. Rothfeld, we are told that in other compacts when they really mean to give one State the right to take another State's water, the provision in the compact is much clearer, much more definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.099" offset="621968">This clause, the one that you rely on, is kind of sketchy, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="138.472" offset="659375">Doesn't say how they're going to get it, if they're going to pay for it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="148.696" offset="700335">Well, the provision that we are relying on, I would say is not sketchy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.250" offset="726562">It is quite clear that all four of the compacting States are in the language of the Compact, have equal rights to the use of water, defined water in a defined area of the subbasin, so long as no State uses more than 25 percent of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.343" offset="782882">That -- that is quite express as to what is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.128" offset="794062">In -- it's difficult to read that language to mean anything other than that the States can take--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="179.716" offset="824364">What is the exact language?</text>

            <text syncTime="270.808" offset="1188720">I mean, I would have thought, if that was their intent, there would be a mechanism for doing it; that you'd have some authority set up by the Compact that would decide where, whether it's really true, and how are we supposed to do it, and there is no such mechanism, rather if there is such a right, which it doesn't say anything about, it's left to the State courts in different States to try to do what is an extremely complex and controversial administrative job.</text>

            <text syncTime="907.788" offset="3736704">Whoever makes the first application will get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.573" offset="3747780">However, Oklahoma can only get -- use 25 percent of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.410" offset="3767215">And therefore, Texas has the right, so long as there is water available and Texas has not used its 25 percent of the subbasin water, Texas has the right to seek that anywhere it can get it in the subbasin.</text>

            <text syncTime="943.727" offset="3880482">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="945.763" offset="3888528">The court of appeals concluded that Oklahoma may categorically foreclose Texas water users from accessing Reach II Subbasin 5 water in Oklahoma, and the court reached that conclusion for reasons that in the view of the United States are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.089" offset="3941922">First, the court of appeals erred in applying a presumption against preemption to determine whether the challenged Oklahoma laws conflict with the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.427" offset="3971283">The rationale for that presumption where it has been applied is one of federalism, but the States themselves created the terms of the interstate Compact, and respect for the States as sovereigns in that context requires enforcement of the Compact according to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.669" offset="4024155">Second, the court of appeals relied on general Compact provisions to conclude that the Compact gives States unrestricted authority to regulate the water within their boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.875" offset="4061040">But the general provisions of the Compact make clear that a State's regulation of water has to be consistent with the allocations made under the Compact, and each State's obligations under the Compact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.157" offset="4162186">And it seems to me that you may be right that the Compact either says you get the water or you don't, and the dormant Commerce Clause is just irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.865" offset="4200952">But I read the opinion of the court of appeals as being quite consistent with that proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1059.621" offset="4343999">And we don't disagree with that, that the -- that the commerce clause shouldn't come into play here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.923" offset="4361239">Where we disagree with the Court of Appeals is with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that, regardless of whether a State law would frustrate the purpose or pose an obstacle to a State obtaining its share of water under the Compact, that that State law should prevail under the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.766" offset="4424560">So the Compact makes clear that those general provisions preserving State water law need to be consistent with each State's obligations under the Compact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.910" offset="4589132">Section 2.01 says that,</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.112" offset="4598013">"Each State may freely administer water rights and uses in accordance with the laws of that State, but that such -- such uses shall be subject to the availability of water in accordance with the Compact. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1221.375" offset="4990999">That -- that -- you know, and it -- it suggests how difficult the process is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.612" offset="5012002">And then you look at this provision, and maybe this provision can be read as an entitlement, but it can just as easily, as -- as Justice Breyer suggested, be read as a cap, “ no more than 25 percent ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.337" offset="5058918">So as between those two possible readings, the complexity of your way of reading this, which would have -- why?</text>

            <text syncTime="1246.693" offset="5092250">--Justice Kagan, I'd like to, if I could, go to the second point, which is on the -- the -- whether you read this as a 25 percent entitlement or a cap, and I would like to point the Court, not just to the language of the Compact, which we think weighs in favor of the idea that each right -- each State has an equal right and that the -- the equal right to use the water in the subbasin implies an equal right, not just an opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.339" offset="5178872">But the interpretive comments that follow Section 5.05(b) -- this is at page 30 of the is Joint Appendix -- refer to a “ right ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.112" offset="5213981">The first full paragraph there says, “ When the flows ” -- I'm sorry; it's the -- the second line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.433" offset="5239267">"If the States have competing uses and the amount of water available in excess of 3,000 cubic feet per second cannot satisfy all such uses, each State will honor the other State's right to 25 percent of the excess flow. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.174" offset="5286183">The Red River Compact Commission also approved rules and regulations, and those say -- they're on page, I think, 19 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.798" offset="5328710">I might have that page -- yeah, I have that page wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.666" offset="5336234">But the -- the Red River Compact Commission's rules and regulations say that when the flow is above 12,000 cubic feet per second, so that Louisiana could get its 3,000 cubic feet per second,</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.456" offset="5379388">"each of the signatory States shall be entitled to 25 percent of the total runoff in undesignated flow. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.426" offset="5403212">So I think it -- it's pretty clear that based on the -- both the text of the Compact and the interpretive comments in the rules that the Red River Compact Commission came up with, that there is not just that you can take whatever is in your borders even if that doesn't amount to 25 percent, but -- but that each State is entitled to 25 percent of the water, and that if that involves going into another State within this geographic area that's not defined with respect to State boundaries, then that is permissible under the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.779" offset="5520658">And as the Petitioner pointed out, when the States wanted to impose a State boundary restriction in the Compact, they did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.849" offset="5544900">There are several subbasins that span more than one geographic -- or more than one State, and the Compact in those provisions says that you can take whatever you want within your boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.824" offset="5584815">And I also don't think that this is going to be particularly troublesome to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.911" offset="5609161">I mean, there may need to be some further proceedings on that, but Oklahoma law provides the backdrop for what would happen when a Texas water user goes in to -- to ask for a permit to appropriate and divert water from within Oklahoma.</text>

            <text syncTime="2318.006" offset="9377586">What they would have to do, which no one else -- no one has done -- and I think the drafters thought it was ultimately impossible because of Arkansas and Louisiana, is call for an accounting and actually figure out what the total was, figure out what the excess was, divvy up the 4 shares, do exactly what Tarrant wants I guess to happen, which has never happened, and it's not clear to the drafters of the compliance rules that it could in fact ever happen because of the riparian laws of Arkansas and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.942" offset="9497331">But -- so in other words, if we lost this case, which is probably why Tarrant is disavowing the United States' view, is Texas would be in quite of a pickle trying to prove they couldn't get their 25 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.500" offset="9543515">And so I read Tarrant as saying, don't you dare send us back to try to prove that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.385" offset="9563055">We want to be able to go whole hog into Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.587" offset="9575907">And if I could get to the point that Justice Kagan was talking about, what's on the ground happening, and why Oklahoma would have never agreed to this type of cross-border right, because what Tarrant is doing is exploiting Oklahoma's law, which proceeds on the assumption that water in Oklahoma is a public trust that's held for the exclusive benefits of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.500" offset="9655528">And there are three ways where Oklahoma would not have agreed to this, and it would have been carefully articulated in a Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.340" offset="9686875">The first is prior appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.490" offset="9695443">There are 4 Texas entities that have signed up for permits: The Upper Trinity, the North Texas Municipal Water District, Irving and Tarrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.529" offset="9727626">And poor Oklahoma City got sandwiched in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.164" offset="9738180">It beat -- it beat Trinity to the permit office by 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.718" offset="9756361">And so, not surprisingly, it's open season for Oklahoma water, all of north Texas has come in and sought a permit and there's priority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2420.889" offset="9789066">Even if you take within State, all of these people, if they were applying for water in Texas as well, there'd be the same issue there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.131" offset="9846013">Well, I have two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.083" offset="9849879">First, had -- had Oklahoma seen this coming, since they hadn't heard about this until Tarrant filed its application, Oklahoma City certainly would have gotten in line faster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.421" offset="9883212">And second of all, the whole point of this Compact -- and if you think about your equitable apportionment doctrines, which whoever gets to the water first gets a prior -- gets a priority permanently -- this was the point of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.081" offset="9933889">Louisiana and Arkansas wouldn't have to develop their water, Texas and Oklahoma were much more economically developed States, and the equal rights prevented a race to the permit office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.603" offset="9971923">Let me get to the second aspect what's a problem, and that is, compacts usually spell out the points of diversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.840" offset="9992926">The last place Oklahoma would have picked as the point of diversion is the Kiamichi River, and Tarrant is saying, not surprisingly, it's the most desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.196" offset="10026363">And the third is the eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.529" offset="10035662">Eminent domain law in Oklahoma proceeds on the assumption that those are Oklahomans who got the permit, and thus can exercise a core sovereign power, and Tarrant, not surprisingly, would like to come in and do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.270" offset="10082578">And none of this is happening with the normal political checks in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.241" offset="10098461">Oklahoma can't vote out of office the Tarrant officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.526" offset="10111626">It cannot vote out of office the Upper Trinity or the North Texas Municipal Water District.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.670" offset="10692172">And I -- you don't have time now to ask the United States' view, but I think the United States would agree with us that if you give this border thing kind of the magical meaning, borders kind of appear and disappear with the water flow, which is very strange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.930" offset="10753298">Tarrant thinks that there's some heretofore unheard of crediting system, but they don't have an explanation on how (b)(2) and (c) -- but more importantly, if you could just turn to 9A for just a minute, which is 402, I want to walk you through this -- I'm sorry, 401(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.677" offset="10832188">This is a provision that -- this is water wholly within Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2691.799" offset="10872730">So you have a big chunk of Texas, and Texas is allocated 60 and Oklahoma is allocated 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.437" offset="10895300">Now, under Tarrant's view, because this is silent as to borders and because Oklahoma is not in this reach, it's not actually located within the subbasin, Oklahoma either is entitled to or has to go get all of its water from Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.613" offset="10956008">And this pattern repeats itself -- this is on page 41 of our brief -- throughout the Compact, where the Compact is silent as to borders, and under their view -- and their Louisiana view is somewhat entertaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.622" offset="11012015">I can't tell if they think Louisiana can go into Oklahoma or has to move one inch up to the border to take it out as opposed to just waiting, but under this view -- and again, it repeats itself throughout the contract -- the State that's not in the basin, because there are no borders and because, I guess under their view, the only way that Oklahoma to get its water would be to go into Texas, and that's why they're sort of taking this bit about, oh, this Russello principle, if it's here, it must mean -- it must have had significance, would make a complete mess of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.927" offset="11137194">If I could also just turn to the remand of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2765.431" offset="11167287">And that is, I do think it is significant that it's pointed -- it is addressed to a problem that Texas itself has never asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.187" offset="11198320">They're saying well, poor Texas can't get its water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.303" offset="11206784">And remember, Texas is upstream, so this sort of poor Texas is only to Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.841" offset="11228936">No other State is going to have this problem because the rest are downstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.328" offset="11242833">So this you have to be able to get to your 25 percent is a uniquely pro-Texas provision that apparently at the same time for 20 years of drafting history when Texas was trying to buy this water, and the three States were saying “ no way, no how ”, they either subconsciously or unconsciously or unintentionally enacted this provision for Texas's benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3096.797" offset="12492740">Well, that's not what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.649" offset="12496083">It just says equal rights to the use subject to a cap, and we think a cap by limiting the use is not a guarantee that you can reach the cap, much less that you can cross borders to reach the cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.457" offset="12543313">And if I could just make one more sense--</text>

            <text syncTime="3112.492" offset="12555538">Ms. Blatt, the solicitor general here today spoke of lots of different examples where the language of entitlement and rights was used.</text>

            <label>Ms. Lisa S. Blatt</label>
            <text syncTime="3122.614" offset="12595976">--So they -- you mean the two compliance rules they cited?</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.566" offset="12607783">They cited -- so they say -- that's what I was saying that was sort of sad is because what they cited disproved what they were trying to assert it for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.422" offset="12639235">So if you -- you don't even have to read the -- you don't even have to read the compliance rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.190" offset="12654281">Just read page 19 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.809" offset="12660759">They say in the same sentence that we have an equal -- there's an equal right to one-fourth of an excess above 3,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.730" offset="12688449">So that means you take whatever is above 3,000 and divide by four equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.998" offset="12705481">And then they cite a provision that only divides by 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.319" offset="12718751">And then the next provision they cite didn't divide the excess, it divided the total water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.038" offset="12741635">I don't know why they -- it's inexplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.757" offset="12756577">I can't tell you why they did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.793" offset="12768697">And the only other thing I want to say on the extrinsic evidence, and I do think -- if you think there's any ambiguity in here, which I think there clearly is, you have 30 years of post ratification, which the States immediately did long-term water planning without so mentioning of this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.355" offset="12842990">And Tarrant actually offered to buy the same water for $1.7 billion in 2002, which is a little bit inconsistent with the notion that they had this right all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.211" offset="12882382">They just, in 18 months of negotiating history, never mentioned that they thought they owned the water, they were actually offering to pay 1.7 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.084" offset="12921879">And the amicus brief filed by the Tribes, on page 4, says we were at the negotiating table and we never heard Tarrant mention this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.540" offset="12959705">And the other thing, I do think the water planning documents are highly significant because not so much Louisiana and Arkansas, but Oklahoma and Texas take water planning very seriously because of their prior appropriation systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.082" offset="13009860">There are hundreds of thousands of pages on the Internet and none of them mention this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.402" offset="13027101">Again, they cited something in their reply brief, but if you go look at it, it doesn't come close to mentioning a right of Subbasin 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.056" offset="13057716">Again, ironically it mentioned a portion of Oklahoma where Texas would have to actually buy the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.876" offset="13077047">We'd ask you to affirm.</text>

            <text syncTime="3251.399" offset="13111110">A couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.549" offset="13115708">First, my friend, Ms. Blatt, said that it would make mincemeat and a complete mess out of the Compact to apply its terms as they were written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.088" offset="13153847">We think that this Compact was negotiated over a period of 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.159" offset="13170147">If you look at the Joint Appendix, you will very painfully see that there are reams and reams of commentary on the -- on the negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.265" offset="13206614">I think the Court has to assume that when the drafters of the Compact used language and referred to State lines in one place and not in another place, they had some idea of what they were doing and they made these different choices intentionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.970" offset="13249455">So I think the Court simply should read the terms of the Compact--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="3288.305" offset="13258755">So how do you deal with all the provisions she was mentioning with respect to the 60/40 division?</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.844" offset="13288952">I can't make rhyme or reason of those provisions that don't use within State boundaries, but it has to mean that.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_a_rothfeld" startTime="3305.300" stopTime="3492.538">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="3305.300" offset="13326777">--Well, I don't think that it has to mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.684" offset="13332315">If Oklahoma wants to enter Texas to take -- if it makes more sense for them to do it, they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.723" offset="13356452">If not, they can just wait for the water to flow down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.406" offset="13363140">I think one thing which -- which Ms. Blatt did not address is the practicalities of how Subbasin 5 operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.210" offset="13386337">If you look at the map that was pointed out to you, Subbasin 5, which is what we're talking about here, is a very wide -- hundreds of miles wide, but extremely narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.982" offset="13417475">It's 10 to 20 miles wide -- north to south for most of its length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.451" offset="13431372">The reason the drafters drew this is because the States all take -- the assumption was all of the water in this Subbasin was going to be surplus water, literally excess water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.623" offset="13468048">The States all take the water that they want to use outside of Subbasin 5, and so the -- the allocations that Ms. Blatt was referring to by Oklahoma are all in Subbasin 1; they are not in Subbasin 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.663" offset="13504201">The water that flows into Subbasin 5 is water that the States assumed was going to be surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.650" offset="13524159">And so it would make no sense, having divided this water evenly between the compacting States, to think that the drafters would have required a water user in Texas at the far west end, which would get its portion of the 25 percent share two miles across the border in Oklahoma, instead to have to go 200 miles to the east to get it out of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.296" offset="13606706">That is not what the drafters intended to accomplish by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.332" offset="13618826">They created, by the plain terms of the -- of the language, a common pool of water defined by dam site, not by State line, and gave each State equal rights to access that water so long as they did not use more than 25 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.890" offset="13673057">Your response to a question which was raised by Justice Kagan both to me and Ms. Blatt, I think the practical application of this is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.531" offset="13715688">One simply has to apply to the permitting authorities, wherever you're submitting your application from, they will apply their ordinary standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.303" offset="13746722">Oklahoma Water Resources Board does that now for applications from within Oklahoma; it can do it just as well for applications from Texas or other from other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.890" offset="13777128">And, again, the practicality of this is, water users are going to want to use water as close to where they are located as they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.611" offset="13803982">They're going to go right across the State line within Subbasin 5 if that's the place to get the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.198" offset="13822268">It makes no sense to require them to go hundreds of miles distant to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.169" offset="13842226">Ms. Blatt suggested that we are reading the 25 percent limitation out of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.858" offset="13876916">I think her reading reads the equal rights language out of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.476" offset="13887470">They read the Subbasin 5 language as being all capped and no entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.778" offset="13904606">It does two things: It gives equal rights to the water, and then says that you can't take more than 25 percent within your State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.165" offset="13934177">So it's designed to do two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.984" offset="13941491">It's designed to give you an entitlement and to say you can only use 25 percent of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.986" offset="13953507">And finally, Ms. Blatt raised questions of sovereignty and political concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.390" offset="13975137">As the Chief Justice suggested, this is a Compact that's an agreement between coordinate sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.608" offset="13991959">They have decided what they want to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.710" offset="14000319">And the thing that gives respect to sovereignty is to read the plain language of the Compact as the framers wrote it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.150" offset="14030098">Again, they spent 25 years writing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.733" offset="14036472">They took considerable care, as you can tell if you look at the negotiating history, in using the words for each provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.803" offset="14060714">Those words should be given meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.188" offset="14066252">If there are no further questions.</text>
