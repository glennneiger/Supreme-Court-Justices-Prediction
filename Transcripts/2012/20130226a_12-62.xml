            <text syncTime="1543.660" offset="6280235">And the district court sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines range, agreeing with the policy of increasing sentences with the amount of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.015" offset="6317642">That same policy was present, but not the same level of increase, in the 1998 guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.621" offset="6344078">So I think there's clearly, as applied to his sentence, the significant risk he would not have gotten 70 months, which would have been an upward variance of 50 -- of 50 percent from the old guidelines range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.696" offset="6396323">But I think if the Court does wish to consider the broader ruling, I think it's also true that it is inherent in this system, in the Rita and Gall framework, which provide for a mandatory benchmark, which provide for the substantive reasonableness review, that you're going to have some significant risk of some increased quantum of punishment as a result of this change in law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.469" offset="8187487">If you won the case on that ground, I would say that what the guidelines and the Sentencing Commission are best at, gathering information from across the country and saying a typical person who commits this crime in a typical way should be sentenced to the typical range that applies, let's say 18 to 24 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.834" offset="8276930">That would be down the drain.</text>

            <text syncTime="2076.288" offset="8410677">The commission has the expertise in the first, the judge in the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.626" offset="8428022">And so there is at least a question as to whether the court of appeals should give more leeway to the guidelines in the first and more leeway to the judge in the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.517" offset="8475670">Now, I think Rita is consistent with that, and I think every opinion we have written is consistent with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.392" offset="8631150">Now, I didn't know that issue was in this case and that changes the case dramatically for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.313" offset="8658840">And I thought we could decide this just on the ground that this is a law that changes punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.972" offset="8709413">The question is whether it inflicts greater punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.674" offset="8724251">And there is a test on that and the controlling inquiry is whether retroactive application of a change in a law that affects punishment created a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached.</text>

            <text syncTime="3035.363" offset="12247020">Now, the defendant would have a very good argument in that case that the current guidelines range would simply not be appropriate for him, and I think a district court would do well to listen to that argument in that particular case if it thought that the sentences that the new guidelines range was suggesting were out of whack with the statute at the time the offense was committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3331.417" offset="13431203">And if the Court found it necessary to look at that here, in -- the post-Booker report makes clear that sentencing practices vary over the districts, over the circuits, and with respect to particular guidelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.782" offset="13836728">Five quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.250" offset="13846550">First, the Government says this must be an overt legal restraint to be within the Ex Post Facto Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.554" offset="13871732">This Court has repeatedly, in Weaver and other cases, said it's the effect of the change of law, not its form, that matters for ex post facto purposes, the effect on punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.594" offset="13911960">And what this revision and amendment of the mandatory benchmark did was to alter the legal framework in a way that channelled and redefined the exercise of discretion in the direction of greater punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.254" offset="13962533">Secondly, what range is the -- is the mandatory benchmark under the statute matters greatly, as Justice Kennedy alluded to, to appellate review for substantive reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.561" offset="14011852">You have -- it's the key factor in determining whether a sentence is reasonable, and it's the standard to which a presumption of reasonableness may attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.433" offset="14051350">Third, as far as the record, there's -- there's no analysis in the record of the 1998 guidelines other than to -- to set them aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.539" offset="14087712">And -- and what you have to have under the Constitution is, he has to actually apply those as the statute required at the time of the offense, as the mandatory benchmark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.479" offset="14127523">Instead, he's quite clear, he's applying the '98 guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.948" offset="14145390">He's deferring to the -- to the policy judgments there, and to the loss calculations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.186" offset="14170363">So it had a clear substantive effect on his risk of greater punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.138" offset="14186141">The post-Booker report does have those line -- those charts that show that for all offenses and for fraud offenses, when the guidelines' minimum goes up, the average sentences go up, and that's a very compelling point of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.766" offset="14252597">And finally, I would point out here that one of the amendments here was actually a response of the commission to a congressional directive in the wake of the Enron scandal and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, where there was great public and legislative outrage over light fraud sentences, to reconsider the fraud guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.113" offset="14333995">And that puts this in the core of the Ex Post Facto Clause, that it violates fundamental notions of retroactivity for a legislature to be able to alter the law of punishment after the offense.</text>
