            <text syncTime="8.404" offset="138513">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.022" offset="148962">From the first Congress in 1790, Congress has made the decision that all Federal statutes which are, of course, creatures that are created by Congress in statutes, should be subject to a statute of limitations; in this particular case, 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.614" offset="215418">When it comes to conspiracy cases, as this Court said in Hyde, the statute of limitations is treated a little differently, because conspiracy statutes are -- excuse me, conspiracy crimes -- are continuing offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.874" offset="268394">So the Court said the way we determine -- one way to determine whether a particular defendant's involvement in a conspiracy has ended -- in other words, his membership has ended -- is by the doctrine of withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.265" offset="318027">It's the statute of limitations that is the defense in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.317" offset="334223">It's the doctrine of withdrawal that triggers -- that is the triggering event for the statute of limitations, which sets the date for when the statute of limitations starts to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.441" offset="374660">Withdrawal in and of itself is not a defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="90.704" offset="467761">Now, how can something that goes to the existence or non-existence of an affirmative defense be an element?</text>

            <text syncTime="100.746" offset="507885">--Well, I don't -- it is not an element, I agree with that; but it is -- I would say that it's engrafted onto every Federal criminal statute by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.017" offset="548949">This is not the common law, but by Congress's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.803" offset="560130">I would also say that even though it's not an element of defense -- of the offense, in Winship, this Court referred to the fact that the government must prove every fact necessary to prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.211" offset="609762">It's a fact necessary--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="127.979" offset="616868">But you could prove the crime without a reasonable -- beyond a reasonable doubt if you never raised the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.300" offset="646125">And statutes of limitations exist for civil claims as well as criminal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.406" offset="678516">And in -- on the civil side, the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, and it's up to the plaintiff to plead and prove -- both plead and prove it, both the burden of production and persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.498" offset="742882">Why should it be different on the criminal side?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. A. J. Kramer</label>
            <text syncTime="163.152" offset="757511">--I think several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.736" offset="763885">First of all, obviously, the burden of proof is different in criminal cases as the court said in Mullaney v. Wilbur.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.140" offset="789485">It has been suggested that because of the difficulties in negating an argument that a homicide was committed in the heat of passion, the burden of proof should rest on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.031" offset="829086">And they said the same may be said of the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of many controverted facts, but this is the traditional burden which our criminal justice system applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.820" offset="872241">I also thin k that the Court has distinguished on some grounds and is the civil statute of limitations from the criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.509" offset="906931">In fact, in the number of cases, this Court has talked about the criminal statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.181" offset="933681">It has never referred to it as an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.698" offset="943712">It has said it's a defense, but it has never said that the defendant is required to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.335" offset="966281">In fact, the Quick case said it's part of the merits of the case; although it doesn't have to be pleaded in the indictment, and the -- that it has to be -- the Government has to present evidence of it and proof of it.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="228.262" offset="1018004">But you -- I think you -- you recognized that -- that the defendant has the burden of production, not the Government, the burden -- burden of coming forward with this defense and producing some evidence of the withdrawal.</text>

          <turn speaker="a_j_kramer" startTime="247.223" stopTime="264.785">

            <text syncTime="247.223" offset="1093863">Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do accept that there is a burden of production as with several other things that are not affirmative defenses like entrapment or alibi, also have a burden of production before the Government has to prove the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.673" offset="1291663">So, it's not -- it doesn't reach back to negate that there was membership at some time, it just says: After withdrawal we no longer prosecute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2932.488" offset="11834892">And generally, in proving that a crime actually happened beyond a reasonable doubt, you also prove when the crime actually happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.241" offset="11857880">And so it doesn't really add very much to what the government's burden already is in proving the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2961.154" offset="11949517">The person -- the defendant will almost always be in a better position to have the information about whether he withdrew except in cases where he withdraws by making a clean rest with the government, in which case it's hard to imagine he's going to be indicted for -- for the indictment past that period, except in those cases he will know what he said in secret to his coconspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.699" offset="12019734">Second, the government will also be prevented from bringing up evidence to rebut an assertion of withdrawal, because it can't make a defendant testify and it often won't be able to make his coconspirators testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.638" offset="12059441">Third, a defendant doesn't have to give any advanced notice of his intention to rely on a withdrawal defense and so often, he can scuttle the defendant's -- the government's ability to procure any other evidence it may be able to procure relevant to the issue of -- of withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.065" offset="12113148">And fourth, Petitioner's rule would encourage spurious assertions of withdrawal, because it has -- it could have the effect of essentially making the government prove something extra.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.921" offset="12148570">It already has to prove that he joined the conspiracy willingly, that the conspiracy existed in the limitations period, but under the government's -- under the Petitioner's rule -- excuse me -- the government would also have to prove that the defendant essentially took some other act to show his membership or somehow re-agreed to the conspiracy--</text>
