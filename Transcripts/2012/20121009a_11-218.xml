            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106990">We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-218, Tibbals v. Carter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.154" offset="131545">Ms. Schimmer.</text>

            <label>Ms. Alexandra T. Schimmer</label>
            <text syncTime="7.420" offset="136665">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.606" offset="149413">This case is here from the Sixth Circuit, which held that habeas claims can be stayed indefinitely because prisoners have a statutory right to competence to assist in their case, but even Mr. Carter now disowns the circuit's rationale, and the court's indefinite stay order was wrong for two other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.667" offset="221615">First, habeas claims cannot be stayed indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="237498">Doing so is fundamentally incompatible with the timeliness concerns underlying AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.189" offset="259650">Second, while we readily acknowledge that limited stays will be appropriate in some situations, this is not one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.362" offset="288384">All of Mr. Carter's claims are record based and, therefore, resolvable without his assistance.</text>

          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="51.099" stopTime="53.385">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="51.099" offset="311372">What situations would they be appropriate in?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alexandra_t_schimmer" startTime="53.385" stopTime="104.650">
            <label>Ms. Alexandra T. Schimmer</label>
            <text syncTime="53.385" offset="320463">Limited stays, we think, Your Honor, would be appropriate in situations where the prisoner's ability to effectively communicate with his counsel or to disclose evidence would be necessary to his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.525" offset="369050">And we think that would be true in a case, potentially, where AEDPA does not restrict Federal review to the state court record.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.029" offset="399039">So here, for instance, we think that the prisoner's assistance would not be necessary, and, therefore, even a limited stay would not be appropriate, because all of Mr. Carter's claims were vetted before the state courts and decided on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.706" offset="453792">And therefore, under 2254(d) in this Court's decision in Pinholster, the Federal court is limited to reviewing the state court record.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.795" offset="486079">We don't think that the prisoner's assistance in that case is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.514" offset="501021">We don't think Mr. Carter has made a case for why his assistance would be necessary in this specific case.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="104.650" stopTime="125.147">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="104.650" offset="525576">Well, why -- why shouldn't the rule be that an indefinite stay is never necessary; you just proceed based on the evidence you have?</text>
            <text syncTime="113.756" offset="561939">Sometimes we have evidence where a witness is missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.958" offset="570820">We have to go on with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.125" offset="575418">Then it could be open to argue in a later case that there was new evidence that was not available.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alexandra_t_schimmer" startTime="125.147" stopTime="160.987">
            <label>Ms. Alexandra T. Schimmer</label>
            <text syncTime="125.147" offset="607496">Well, we absolutely agree, Justice Kennedy, that indefinite stays are never appropriate, regardless of the circumstances; that indefinite stays contravene AEDPA's timeliness concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.603" offset="649397">And to the extent that all of the parties in this case agree now that, to the extent district courts have some power to issue stays -- we say only limited stays -- in these cases, that power is grounded in equitable discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.696" offset="701746">And we do not think that it comports with equitable discretion to allow a prisoner essentially to win his case, to obtain a suspension of his capital sentence, the ultimate end relief that he seeks--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="160.987" stopTime="176.014">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="160.987" offset="750856">What about the second part of the equation?</text>
            <text syncTime="163.522" offset="760992">Suppose that there's no stay, that the habeas proceeding is adjudicated against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.443" offset="784711">He then becomes competent and claims there's new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.545" offset="801116">Would that be grounds to reopen, you think?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alexandra_t_schimmer" startTime="176.014" stopTime="206.033">
            <label>Ms. Alexandra T. Schimmer</label>
            <text syncTime="176.014" offset="811042">--We think in those situations, certainly the State of Ohio wouldn't contest, for instance, under 2254(b), that if you were incompetent before, that that would be a legitimate basis potentially for not having been able to reasonably discover a new claim, if one had a new claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.558" offset="881155">So we do think that moving forward, that no indefinite stay should be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.927" offset="894634">And when the courts move forward, yes, if someone's competency is later restored, there are backstops.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.064" offset="919189">The person, certainly in Ohio, can always go back to state court--</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="212.153" offset="955552">Ms. Schimmer, if you are right that no stay was appropriate in these circumstances, we would never reach the question of how much of a stay is appropriate in other circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.978" offset="998810">Isn't that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alexandra_t_schimmer" startTime="223.728" stopTime="240.689">
            <label>Ms. Alexandra T. Schimmer</label>
            <text syncTime="223.728" offset="1001841">--I think that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.929" offset="1006647">Because I think, to the extent that using this case as a springboard, the Court could draw the boundary line -- could draw one bright boundary line and say indefinite stays are never permitted, but limited stays might be permitted in cases where the claims are not record based.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="240.689" stopTime="242.308">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="240.689" offset="1069654">I'm saying the exact opposite.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="242.608" offset="1077387">In other words, if there was one bright line which says that stays are not appropriate in a record-based claim because there's really nothing that the client can contribute, then we'd have no need or cause to reach the second question of what happens, in a case where a stay might be appropriate, how long that stay should be.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.138" offset="1159516">I agree with you that the Court could rule on that ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.218" offset="1551770">That, of course, was a case where a prisoner was seeking to abandon his further appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.372" offset="1572459">There are multiple reasons why we think that Rees does not endorse the power of Federal courts to indefinitely stay habeas proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.228" offset="1607881">One is the fact that the Court's stay order was completely unexplained and very terse, didn't announce any rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.815" offset="1638183">Second, the historical record shows that the Court's stay in Rees was, at most, a judicially negotiated settlement, meaning far from a demonstration of the Court's inherent power.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.522" offset="1681024">It seemed to be a very carefully orchestrated exercise of consented-to power.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.343" offset="1704326">I could take objection to that characterization, because the clerk of the Court told the Court that neither party was happy with what was happening, and the Court still entered the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.574" offset="7469237">So it's because of the rarity of these claims, because they are not going to come up every day, and because district courts exist as strong checkpoints to prevent non-genuine claims of competence or not potentially meritorious claims for which the petitioner's assistance is necessary, a narrow stay authority should be preserved and should be applied to Mr. Carter's case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1912.967" offset="7758778">And it's a measure of the Sixth Circuit's moderation and discretion that they held that only the claims that genuinely require his assistance should be stayed; the others may go forward with the help of the next friend.</text>
