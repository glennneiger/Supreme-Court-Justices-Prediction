            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">I have the opinion of the Court this morning in case 11-1347, Chafin against Chafin.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.215" offset="135335">This case involves an international child custody dispute, but the question we resolve today is not which parent gets custody of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.717" offset="169294">It is instead whether an American court still has jurisdiction in the case when the child in question has been taken out of this country and it is not clear whether the Court could do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.452" offset="220285">The United States has signed a treaty known as the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.249" offset="243482">If there is a custody dispute between parents in different countries, that treaty generally provides that the custody will be determined in the child's -- and this is a term of art, country of habitual residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.147" offset="294996">If one of the parents has taken the child away from that country or prevented the child from returning to it, the other parent can get an order directing that the child be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.251" offset="339404">Jeffery Chafin is a member of the U.S. Military.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.069" offset="350689">When he was stationed in Germany in 2006, he married a Scottish woman by the name of Lynne Hales.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.798" offset="377647">Together, they had a daughter whom we will call E.C. Short time later, Mr. Chafin was sent to Afghanistan and Ms. Chafin took E.C. to Scotland.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.594" offset="420801">When Mr. Chafin came back to the United States, specifically Alabama, Ms. Chafin and E.C. eventually came to join him, but the marriage degenerated and Mr. Chafin filed for divorce in Alabama Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.206" offset="479316">As those proceedings went on, Ms. Chafin was deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.899" offset="494049">She'd overstayed her visa and E.C. remained in Alabama with Mr. Chafin.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.256" offset="519440">But then Ms. Chafin filed suit in federal court asking the judge to order that E.C. be returned to Scotland pursuant to the Hague Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.900" offset="557996">Ms. Chafin came back to the United States for a hearing, at the end of which, the District Court ruled that E.C.'s country of habitual residence was indeed Scotland and that Ms. Chafin could take her back.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.837" offset="609823">Ms. Chafin and E.C. got on a plane headed to Scotland within hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.124" offset="630930">Mr. Chafin appealed, but the Court of Appeals dismissed his case as moot because E.C. was in Scotland, the Court of Appeals thought that it was powerless to grant Mr. Chafin any remedy even if he were to win.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.266" offset="691534">The District Court then ordered Mr. Chafin to reimburse Ms. Chafin for her attorney's fees and travel expenses to the tune of $94,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.760" offset="733435">Now, the Constitution tells us that federal courts may only adjudicate real cases or controversies.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.308" offset="759662">Federal courts do not engage in empty gestures, but so long as it's possible for a court to grant some effectual relief, there is still a case or controversy and the case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.337" offset="811802">Here, it is possible for courts to grant effectual relief to the winner.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.264" offset="831551">Mr. Chafin seeks an order that E.C. be return to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.988" offset="850359">Ms. Chafin argues that he will not win on that claim, but that argument goes to who is right on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.491" offset="880452">The mootness issue is whether if Mr. Chafin is right, any court order remedy would be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.411" offset="908037">Now, on that point, Ms. Chafin argues that Mr. Chafin's requested remedy would not be effective because Scotland would ignore any U.S. order that E.C. be sent back, maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.296" offset="959655">But U.S. courts have the power to order people who have appeared before them to take certain actions even if they are outside the country and courts can back up those commands with sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.192" offset="1011169">So, an order that E.C. be return to the U.S. would bind Ms. Chafin and she might decide for a variety of reasons to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.998" offset="1046486">She might refuse to comply of course, but that does not make this case moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.415" offset="1068116">Courts can issue orders even though it is unclear whether they will result in actual relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.740" offset="1093402">For example, a court can order a person to pay damages of $100,000 even though that person is broke.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.030" offset="1122555">As long a decision could have some impact, as long as the person might be able to pay something someday, the case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.095" offset="1158813">Now, Mr. Chafin also wants the order that he pay Ms. Chafin $94,000 overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.647" offset="1189010">Again, Ms. Chafin argues that Mr. Chafin will not succeed because he did not separately appeal that order, but that's beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.910" offset="1226104">Remember, for mootness purposes, we ask whether if Mr. Chafin succeeds, the relief ordered will be effectual, it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.738" offset="1261422">Relief in the form of not having to pay $94,000 would not be entirely satisfactory to Mr. Chafin.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.636" offset="1289007">His daughter would remain in Scotland.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.003" offset="1298411">But $94,000 is $94,000 and it's enough to keep the case alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.657" offset="1321085">For these reasons, the Court of Appeals should not have dismissed this case as moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.810" offset="1337699">Instead, it should have decided it.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.086" offset="1346790">We send the case back to the court below to do just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.137" offset="1366956">Our opinion ends by noting how important it is that these cases be decided as quickly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.071" offset="1390780">The best interest of the child demand that custody proceedings begin promptly and nothing about our ruling today prevents that, quite the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.085" offset="1426829">We think that if these cases did become moot between trial and appeal, courts might grant stays in virtually every case holding up the effectiveness of their opinion to prevent parties from loosing any right to appeal, but then children would loose precious months when they could've been readjusting to life in their country of habitual residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.705" offset="1509272">Instead, we think courts should carefully balance several factors, including the best interest of the child in deciding whether or not the grant stays pending appeal and courts should take every effort to decide these cases as quickly as possible so that stability can be returned to the lives of these children and their parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.567" offset="1588684">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.335" offset="1595789">Justice Ginsburg has filed a concurring opinion in which Justices Scalia and Breyer joined.</text>
