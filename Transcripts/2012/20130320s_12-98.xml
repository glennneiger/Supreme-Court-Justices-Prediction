            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">The second case is No. 12-98, WOS versus EMA.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.647" offset="138031">When a Medicaid beneficiary is injured and later receives a tort judgment or settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.914" offset="163109">The Federal Medicaid statute requires states to seek reimbursement for the amount of the money the states expended for the beneficiary's medical care, at the same time, the Federal Medicaid statute prohibits states from placing a lien on any portion of the tort recovery not designated as payments for medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.246" offset="252447">A North Carolina law says that one third of any beneficiary's tort recovery represents payment for medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.708" offset="282331">Of course the state's share is capped so its recovery is the lesser, the full amount of its expenditure or one third of the beneficiary's tort recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.729" offset="330397">The question is whether this law is consistent with the anti-lien provision in the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.026" offset="351608">Respondent, E. M. A. and her parents sued her physician in a hospital where she was born after she suffered multiple serious birth injuries that left her deaf, blind and with little mobility.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.968" offset="403331">She requires between 12 and 18 hours of skilled nursing care per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.772" offset="422557">The lawsuit sought damages for E. M. A. and for her parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.211" offset="440320">Though the damages sought were over $42 million, the suit was settled with the assistance of a mediator for $2.8 million and this amount apparently was driven in large part by the amount of insurance coverage that was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.596" offset="493819">Under the statute here at issue, the state statute, North Carolina demanded one third of this amount as reimbursement for its expenses. E. M. A. and her parents argued that the state's one third rule violates the Medicaid anti-lien provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.062" offset="551706">The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that this North Carolina's law is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.052" offset="571664">This Court agrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.687" offset="578247">In the opinion filed today, the Court concludes that the federal anti-lien provision does preempt North Carolina's irrebuttable statutory presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.095" offset="615863">In an earlier case from this court called Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services versus Ahlborn, the Court held that the Federal Medicaid statutes says both the floor and the ceiling on a state's potential share of the beneficiary's tort recovery through federal law that requires an assignment to the state the right to recover the portion of a settlement that represents payments for medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.952" offset="711262">But that same federal law also prohibits the state from taking any part of the remainder of the settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.958" offset="731324">Under North Carolina statute however, when the state's Medicaid expenditures exceed one third of the beneficiary's tort recovery, the statute establishes a conclusive presumption that the one third of the recovery represents compensation for medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.672" offset="794122">North Carolina's law in some circumstances would permit the state to take a portion of the Medicaid beneficiary's tort judgment or settlement not designated for medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.312" offset="832679">The law sets forth no process for determining what portion of the beneficiary tort recovery is attributable to medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.087" offset="863817">Instead, the state has picked arbitrary percentage, and by statutory command labeled that portion of the beneficiary's tort recovery is representing payment for medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.667" offset="902165">The state may evade preemption through creative statutory interpretation or description.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.505" offset="921496">The Court's opinion in Ahlborn contemplated the possibility of an allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.950" offset="943229">It envisage that a judicial or administrative proceeding would be necessary where a beneficiary and the state cannot agree on what portion of the settlement represents compensation for medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.165" offset="988160">North Carolina's irrebuttable one size fits all presumption is incompatible with the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.644" offset="1014073">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.846" offset="1022851">Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.176" offset="1032150">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas joined.</text>
