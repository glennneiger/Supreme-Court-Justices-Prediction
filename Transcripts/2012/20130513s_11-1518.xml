            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">Justice Breyer has our opinion this morning in case 11-1518, Bullock v. BankChampaign.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="8.253" stopTime="343.584">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="8.253" offset="140434">In 1978, the father of the petitioner, the petitioner Mr. Randy Bullock, but his father created a family trust that had a single asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.983" offset="179409">A life insurance policy on the father's life, Randy was the trustee and Randy and his four siblings were the beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.983" offset="215353">Now, the policy and the trust instrument permitted the trustee, namely Randy, to borrow money against the policy's value and Randy did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.480" offset="253388">Once he did it because his father asked him to get some money to give it to his mother who used it for the family business, once he did it to help his mother and Randy himself by a mill and once he did it to allow his mother and again Randy himself to buy other real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.283" offset="320575">Now, Randy saw that all of the money was eventually paid back to the trust along with 6% interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.600" offset="349832">In 1999, Randy's brothers claimed that Randy had violated his fiduciary obligations and they sued him in state court and the state court said, “Randy does not appear to have had a malicious motive in borrowing funds from the trust, but given self-dealing, which it certainly was, nonetheless, the Court required him to pay the trust back money that he had made from his borrowings.”</text>
            <text syncTime="85.849" offset="450873">The Court imposed constructive trust on various assets to make sure Randy did pay those debts to the trust, the money he made out of to borrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.031" offset="483579">Randy asked the new trustee, there was a new trustee by then, the BankChampaign to allow him to liquidate some of the assets so he would have money to pay back.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.174" offset="524121">BankChampaign inexplicably wouldn't let him do that and Randy then said, “I'm bankrupt,” then he went into federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.622" offset="554005">Now with all that, it sort of been interesting story, we're now at the legal issue in the case, a question of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.026" offset="583576">Can Randy discharge in bankruptcy his debts to the trust?</text>
            <text syncTime="124.349" offset="604891">Why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="125.453" offset="609280">Well, the Bankruptcy Code says that an individual cannot obtain a discharge in bankruptcy from a debt “for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity embezzlement or larceny.”</text>
            <text syncTime="142.923" offset="679184">Are the underlying debts here debts for defalcation?</text>
            <text syncTime="147.303" offset="696633">Oh, that's the question and that depends upon the meaning of defalcation.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.079" offset="715755">In here, in particular, it depends upon we think that the state of mind that accompanied Randy, the trustees' actions, that gave rise to the debt for his breach of fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.828" offset="762776">What is the state of mind that's necessary?</text>
            <text syncTime="166.706" offset="774269">Ever since 1867 when the word defalcation first found its way into the Bankruptcy Codes exception from discharge provision, dictionary, editors, treatise writers, and judges have disagreed about the state of mind question.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.786" offset="842606">Many years ago, for example, Judge Augustus Hand wrote that the relevant “misappropriation must be due to a known breach of the duty and not mere negligence or a mistake.”</text>
            <text syncTime="194.049" offset="883670">The judge learned at hand suggested the terms “may have included innocent default.”</text>
            <text syncTime="200.220" offset="908330">Some modern courts have included innocent acts within the scope of the term, other insisted on conduct that is objectively reckless, still others have said there has to be extreme recklessness, when treatise ends its discussion of the topic with a question mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.506" offset="969456">Now, we have to answer the question mark and we base our answer in an old case called Neal versus Clark written for the Court by the first Justice Harlan in 1878.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.566" offset="1009685">He was thinking about the meaning of the word fraud and he said, “That's created by fraud,” or those who are reading the statute, they're right next to embezzlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.943" offset="1047197">And such association, he said, “Justifies, although it doesn't imperatively require, the conclusion that the fraud means positive fraud or fraud in fact involving moral turpitude, that's a little easier to understand, or intentional wrong as does embezzlement and not implied fraud or fraud in law which may exist without bad faith or immorality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="256.761" offset="1134550">We think the statutory term defalcation should be treated exactly really pretty much the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.434" offset="1157224">So, if the conduct that issued does not involve bad faith, moral turpitude or immoral conduct, then it requires an intentional wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.605" offset="1197871">Justices require for the statutory neighbors, embezzlement, larceny, and fiduciary fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.453" offset="1221277">We include its intentional here, not only conduct that fiduciary knows is wrong, but also reckless conduct of the kind the criminal law often treats as the equivalent of intentional conduct or actual knowledge of wrong doing is missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.784" offset="1278642">The conduct is still the same if a fiduciary can consciously disregard or is willfully belong to a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his conduct will turn out to violate a fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.838" offset="1326811">And that risk has to be of such in nature and degree is considering the nature and purpose of his act -- of his conduct and all of his circumstances its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law abiding person would observe in his situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.224" offset="1388356">Security's law is somewhat similar, so a fairly simple answer to a long-lined up question.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.994" offset="1411448">In our view, this interpretation maintains linguistic harmony.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.370" offset="1428898">It provides each word in the statute with a distinct meaning and it is consistent with the statute's purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.087" offset="1455856">We explained all that further in our opinion, if you want to read it, and the decision is unanimous.</text>
