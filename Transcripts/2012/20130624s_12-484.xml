            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">Justice Kennedy also has our opinion this morning in Case 12-484, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center versus Nassar.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="8.996" stopTime="371.040">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="8.996" offset="143464">When the law grants persons the right to compensation for injury from wrongful conduct, there must be some demonstrated connection, some link between the injury sustained and the wrong that's alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.762" offset="194560">And that connection between wrong and the injury is governed principles of causation and this case requires the Court to define those causation rules and the context of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, particularly with reference to employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.133" offset="259971">That Act provides remedies to employees who are injured by employment discrimination and in this case, the Court discusses the causation rules for two categories of employer conduct that's prohibited by Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.044" offset="311693">The first is what we call “status-based discrimination,” that is discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.238" offset="356415">That discrimination is made unlawful by what we can call here Section 2 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="67.315" offset="376686">The second type of unlawful conduct is under the Act, is employer retaliation for employee's opposition to or an employee's complaints about workplace discrimination and retaliation is prohibited by Section 3 (a), so there's 2 (a) and 3 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="86.809" offset="454740">The petitioner here is the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, respondent, Dr. Nassar is a medical doctor of Middle Eastern descent.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.146" offset="492042">Until July 2006, he was a member of the University faculty and he was also a staff physician at one of its affiliated hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.557" offset="533734">Now, one of respondent's university supervisors was a Dr. Beth Levine.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.644" offset="554005">And Levine expressed the view that Middle Easterners are lazy and she gave particularly close scrutiny to the respondent's billing practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.029" offset="599562">Desiring to escape Levine's oversight, respondent sought an arrangement where he could work at the hospital but not at the university and he reached a tentative deal with the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.381" offset="657032">Then he quit his teaching job and he sent various administrators a letter describing Levine's alleged harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.035" offset="687647">One of these administrators then contacted the hospital to oppose respondent's hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.129" offset="719935">And he asserted that the institutions affiliation agreement reserved staff physician post for faculty members and the doctor was no longer a member of the faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.812" offset="758700">So, the hospital withdrew its offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.588" offset="769776">Respondent then filed suit in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.714" offset="782315">He alleged the university's opposition was retaliation for his having complained about Levine.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.734" offset="806452">There were other claims as well, but the retaliation claim was the relevant one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.557" offset="821708">And on that claim, the jury was instructed that but for causation was not required and applying that standard, the jury found for the respondent and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.186" offset="880222">This Court addressed that issue of causation and employment discrimination in a 1989 case, called Price Waterhouse versus Hopkins, and that case allowed recovery on status-based claims under a lessened causation standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.474" offset="945319">Congress then amended the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.676" offset="954201">That amendment allowed recovery based on lessened causation, but it did limit the remedies that are available when that test was applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.793" offset="990668">Then in the case of Gross versus FBL Financial Services in 2009, this Court considered a different statue that age discrimination in Employment Act and in Gross, the Court held that but for causation, not lessened causation was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.442" offset="1061198">Today, the Court again interprets Title VII and the question is whether the provision that Congress amended, a provision that applies but its terms only to status-based discrimination, should be extended so that it also includes retaliation claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.524" offset="1125564">And today, the Court holds, it should not be extended to those claims and this holding is consistent with the reasoning of Gross and the analysis is based on an interpretation of the text and structure of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.521" offset="1173525">Title VII's retaliation provision makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees because he has opposed or supported a complaint that alleges unlawful employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.097" offset="1231830">And in general, requiring proof that a certain effect occurred because of a ceratin action, means that the effect would not have happened absent that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.457" offset="1269342">In the context of this statute, there is no persuasive reason not to give the word “because” the standard meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.248" offset="1296509">It is true, as respondent argues that the 1991 Amendment provides for the lessened causation standard for some Title VII claims, but that provision applies by its own terms only to claims alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin, the status-based claims that were noted here at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.599" offset="1381878">It says nothing about retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.865" offset="1390968">When Congress created that lessened causation standard in 1991, it added this as a part of Section 2, which is Title VII's bar on status-based discrimination, rather than in a statutory section dealing with retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.798" offset="1446661">These textural and structural clues as well as others discussed in greater detail in the opinion show that retaliation claims must be proved according to the normal rule of but for causation and these requires proof that allegedly unlawful action would not have occurred in the absence of a motive to retaliate.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.428" offset="1517192">Because the Court of Appeals applied the lessened causation standard rather than the “but for standard” the statute requires, its judgment is vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.809" offset="1546658">The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.394" offset="1561078">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Bryer, Sotomayor, and Kagan join.</text>
