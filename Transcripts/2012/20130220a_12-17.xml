            <text syncTime="301.624" offset="1312400">The purpose of it was not to enable people to get information per se, it was to enable people to see how their government is working, so that they could attend to any malfeasance that is occurring in the process of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.151" offset="1378542">It seems to me entirely in accord with that purpose of these laws to say it's only Virginia citizens who -- who are concerned about the functioning of Virginia government, and ought to be able to get whatever records Virginia agencies have.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.145" offset="1450536">First, transparency was one purpose, but as I said, these laws also carried forward the much more longstanding rights to access based on personal interests and property interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.365" offset="1559414">It -- it can't be based on -- on the traditional property interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.859" offset="1841328">But what the State can't say is simply because one purpose of this law is that we want to constitute ourselves as a political community, that we can exclude activities that have a big commercial effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.231" offset="13394869">So he is a creditor seeking to pursue a debt on equal terms with people in the state of Virginia, and the State set up a process: As one step along the way to court, you go to the agency; you ask the agency to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.391" offset="13447427">The agency has unique enforcement tools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.641" offset="13456518">It can suspend someone's driver's license, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.629" offset="13468430">It can -- it can intercept income tax refunds, and it can go to court on your behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.913" offset="13485566">And all he's asking for is the rules of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.198" offset="13494657">He wants to know what procedures apply to that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.167" offset="13510539">And at least where a -- an agency has a process that directly affects a non-stater in the pocketbook, all we are saying is that equal access to the proceedings means equal access to the information governing those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.094" offset="13566337">And, finally, I would just like to close by saying that, you know, what I don't think we heard on the justification side from the State was really any justification, because the State can recoup its costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.950" offset="13609700">And so they are not saying that this will cost them anything more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.752" offset="13620880">Which was the only justification they pressed in -- in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.456" offset="13635718">And so they are left with the position that they can discriminate simply because they think they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.408" offset="13655571">And if you look at the Privileges and Immunities clause, it sits right next to the Full Faith and Credit clause, which indicates, if anything, that the Framers thought that the movement of public records across state lines was important to interstate comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.251" offset="13710950">They changed the Articles of Confederation version, which did not include public records; it only referred to judicial records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.821" offset="13737177">They added a mention of judicial records -- nonjudicial records and saw that that was important to -- to comity across state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.860" offset="13769360">But -- but their position is about the step before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.379" offset="13783466">It's about whether you get the records in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.581" offset="13792243">Thank you.</text>
