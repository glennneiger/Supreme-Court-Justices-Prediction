            <text syncTime="10.389" offset="148914">This is a classic case of impossibility preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.110" offset="167827">Federal law required generic sulindac to have the same ingredients, the same warning and the same safety profile as the branded version, but a New Hampshire jury imposed liability because sulindac didn't have a different safety profile, meaning a different ingredient or a different warning.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.271" offset="248493">And as Mensing recognized, that's an impossibility conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.641" offset="265943">And there is no principle basis for treating design defect claims any differently from failure to warn claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="46.562" offset="293633">Mr. Lefkowitz, could I understand something just about the scope of your argument?</text>
            <text syncTime="50.349" offset="308784">It -- it seems to me that in this case we are not really dealing with generics; we are also dealing with brand-named drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.139" offset="347968">And I guess the -- the thought there would be, in -- with -- with -- in this respect, as to design, as compared to warnings, but as to design, they're really all in the same boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.446" offset="397182">In other words, you know, they have a design; that it is only that design that's approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.366" offset="420797">If they change their design there's no authority to continue marketing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.354" offset="444830">They have to go back to square one.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.122" offset="451830">And that's just as true of brand names as it is of generics.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.408" offset="468967">So am I right about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="92.093" offset="475759">That -- that if we're just looking at a pure design defect claim, putting the warning card aside, where you are in a different position from the brand-name drugs, but as to design, don't the brand-name and the generics go hand in hand?</text>

            <text syncTime="111.154" offset="552036">I'm sure Plaintiff's lawyers would find arguments to differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.956" offset="567187">But the important thing is that it's really a distinction without a difference in real life, because in light of this Court's decision in the Wyeth case, what happens across the board is that design defect claims are brought either as they are in nearly every State where there is a warning component, or--</text>

            <text syncTime="140.857" offset="670841">But let's just assume that there was a design defect claim that didn't have to do with warnings, where you are in a different position.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.308" offset="880656">My point is simply that in the real world, the cases are going to be brought as failure to warn claims, or as design defect claims with warnings component.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="202.681" offset="918064">But, you -- but again, and I know that this is a big part of your argument, but to the extent that a warning was not involved in the claim, and it was just about the design of a drug, I guess I'm asking you, is there any possible way to distinguish between generics and brand-name manufacturers?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay P. Lefkowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="220.976" offset="991311">I'm not sure, Your Honor, that there is a way to distinguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.078" offset="999670">If you were dealing in a regime in a State statute or a State tort regime where the only issue was design, unlike in the New Hampshire design defect, where as we know from PA 18 where the First Circuit made clear that it in fact was the lack of an adequate warning that in fact made the drug more dangerous under the design defect case, the Supreme Court's case Vautour, which is the leading New Hampshire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.162" offset="1108026">And in fact the jury instruction in this case was a binary choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.799" offset="1126625">It specifically said, if you find that the drug is unreasonably dangerous, then you have to take a look at was the warning sufficient or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.888" offset="1158913">We have a case here that is directly controlled by Mensing, because the warning was critical to the design defect case.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.908" offset="1190991">We also have a case here that even if it were just purely a design defect case, at least with respect to a generic drug company, the Federal sameness mandate, the same Federal sameness mandate that applied in Mensing to warnings, applies in design defect cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.953" offset="1263194">And therefore it is a classic impossibility case, just as the Court found in Mensing.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.489" offset="1381372">And Justice Sotomayor, as this Court made clear in Mensing -- in Wyeth -- and as Justice Thomas made clear in his concurring opinion in that case, just because a drug is granted an approval by the FDA does not mean that it's entitled to have the same label for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.933" offset="1451066">The distinction, though, that the Court articulated was that in Wyeth a brand company has the authority, and indeed as this Court found, the obligation to update its warnings.</text>

            <text syncTime="864.334" offset="3564686">The first as to the impossibility, for over 50 -- 50 years exactly now, this Court has been articulating as the paradigmatic example of impossibility preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.623" offset="3605855">The example from Florida Lime and Avocado Growers where the Federal government said you can't sell an avocado with less than 7 percent and you can't sell -- and the State said you can't sell the avocado with more than 8 percent oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.799" offset="3662593">Now, clearly, there is no Federal obligation to sell avocados.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.584" offset="3677744">I would submit that Congress is not agnostic about the sale drugs, but the key is that the quintessential example of impossibility has nothing to do with a Federal right at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="932.061" offset="3835628">And moreover, Congress has -- as I said, is not agnostic here.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.280" offset="3852451">Congress had established a regime where in order to take a drug off the market, Congress had said the FDA has to provide the company with all sorts of due process protection, direct appeal to the Federal court, and in fact, Congress, in 1997, specified that any people at the FDA involved in the drug approval process at all, withdrawing drugs or approving drugs, has to have special technical, scientific expertise, very different from what we have in lay jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.649" offset="3973972">But simply stated, Your Honor, from a impossibility perspective, this is not only the Florida Lime example, this is the Mensing case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.422" offset="4009081">Now, you know, the -- the Respondent doesn't really take issue with either the sameness requirement of design or the sameness requirement of warning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.137" offset="4107928">Instead, what the Respondent does is he tries to carve out a distinction between strict liability and negligence claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.976" offset="4139275">And all I will say before reserving my time is there's simply no basis in the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.493" offset="4757332">And what that means is that a manufacturer will have to pay money in the liability suit if he doesn't meet that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.499" offset="4789411">And as this Court recognized in Riegel and in earlier -- in Cipollone, that this type of tort obligation, when you contingent -- make an obligation to pay tort liability based on meeting a standard under State law, that is a duty that could conflict with a Federal duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.326" offset="5068712">It's not clear to me, first, that Respondent is in fact adopting the Government's position, because in our view, the obligation to change the labeling to make it safer and therefore escape liability under design-defect law in New Hampshire falls within the Court's decision in PLIVA v. Mensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.287" offset="5140496">The only distinguishing factor we think that is material here would be whether the ability to stop selling mean that there's really not a conflicting obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.727" offset="5174247">And as that would have been true in Mensing, it would have been true also in Levine, and would not have necessitated any impossibility analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.435" offset="5217088">And I think this, as my brother was just explaining, traces back to Florida Lime and Avocado Growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.755" offset="5242374">The court framed the impossibility preemption inquiry there -- and I think this is important -- at the top of page 143.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.009" offset="5271422">It says, the question is whether compliance with Federal and State regulation is a physical impossibility for one engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.948" offset="5307158">That was the -- the formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.002" offset="5323354">So the idea is if you are an avocado grower in Florida and the Federal government said you have to pick your avocados before they're at 7 percent oil and then California says, you can't sell in our State unless it's 8 percent oil, it's impossible to be a person engaged in interstate commerce there unless you violate one of those obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.400" offset="5828980">Not simply because the FDA has set the standard, but the FDCA also has within it the judgment that safety is best effectuated not only by having the FDA set the standard, but by forbidding any manufacturer from deviating from that once it's been approved by the FDA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1694.949" offset="6887148">What the State law is seeking to do here, Mr. Chief Justice, is to impose liability where there is proof of an unreasonably dangerous product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.638" offset="6921943">That unreasonable danger entails evidence of a risk/benefit analysis that looks at the overall risks to the population against the overall benefits that are provided for the drug.</text>

            <text syncTime="1919.792" offset="7786596">Let me address that, because I think that's the hardest part of this case to understand, and why this is different from Mensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.279" offset="7812510">In a strict liability case in New Hampshire, the warning is not relevant as a -- as an element of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.471" offset="7849290">What the jury is required as an element of the claim is to prove unreasonable dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.039" offset="7871546">And District Judge La Plant, who presided over this very complex and difficult trial with a lot of skill, understood the difference between the concept of adequacy of a warning which describes the risks and efficacy of the warning which limits or minimizes the risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.452" offset="7953153">And all over the pretrial instructions, he made very clear to the counsel, you are not to argue about adequacy of the warning, because that goes to the comment k defense that they waived on the eve of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.046" offset="8011563">Instead, once the jury finds that the drug is unreasonably dangerous, it may use the warning as a way to limit or minimize the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.603" offset="8057747">In other words, the warning could only benefit Mutual, because liability was going to be found in spite of the warning and not because of the warning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2677.908" offset="10818994">The adequacy of the warning under a strict liability law simply goes to did the manufacturer adequately describe the risks that the patient might incur.</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.299" offset="11292542">There is a difference between the application of impossibility preemption, which I don't think anybody here can argue with a straight face that simply paying a judgment in strict liability is impossible in light of the Federal regime, an obstacle preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.242" offset="11352310">Now, it may well be that there could be cases out there like your life-saving type drug, which by the way has a special regulation under a special statute to ensure that that is on the market, and some other drug where the risk/benefit equation is -- is such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.435" offset="11417094">But surely in our system we have to trust district judges to be able to grant or deny judgments as a matter of law, where they conclude that the evidence would not be sufficient to show that the risk outweighed the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.409" offset="11465055">And here, the judge made very clear that because Mutual had not put in any evidence of the benefit of its drug at all and arguably couldn't have done so because this drug is like aspirin -- except that it causes these horrific injuries -- it's reasonable to suppose that a jury which can decide misbranding actions under the FDCA, and that has been acknowledged by the majority in Wyeth v. Levine, can make the very same risk/benefit safety determination that Justice Thomas in his concurring opinion said also is -- enabled the States to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.732" offset="11602354">The States are not precluded under the FDCA from making that kind of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.636" offset="11621894">So in the hard case, Justice Breyer, there is a mechanism for preemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.786" offset="11842576">So Justice Kagan, that's why it's perfectly reasonable for the trial lawyers here to think that the warning is an appropriate thing because this Court's case that had just been decided made that perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.176" offset="11888134">But what was interesting here was that Judge Laplante made a very clear distinction between the role that the warning would play, appropriately so, under a strict liability regime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3281.555" offset="13233649">Because the premise of their argument is that simply because the FDA approved the drug and there would need to be some State law claim that would give rise to some alteration, that that necessarily would mean that it would be impossible to comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.934" offset="13303135">And so that applies to brand name drugs as well as generic drugs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.054" offset="13339602">I don't want to speak for all 50 States, but the basic gist of their argument is FDA approval over olives.</text>

            <text syncTime="3343.227" offset="13480245">I want to make one other point, which is that strict liability applies to distributors as well as to manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.500" offset="13517339">And so here it seems obvious that a distributor can't change the design and it cannot change the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.323" offset="13544715">But under normal principles of strict liability, the idea is that if you are a seller of the product in your normal course and it is a dangerous product that causes somebody to be injured, you can be held liable in strict liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.214" offset="13592258">That principle is very well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.597" offset="13601767">And so it would seem odd to suppose that the distributor who has no power to make any change in conduct that would make the product any safer also gets to be immunized from suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3530.879" offset="14230900">And, in fact, as the First Circuit made very, very clear at PA 18A, it said, the label was relevant to the design defect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3552.776" offset="14318462">We objected at the very beginning of this case, we said this is all preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3609.246" offset="14544369">I want to just finish with two brief points, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.681" offset="14554087">On impossibility, look, this impossibility doctrine under preemption is premised on the fact that parties will engage in conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.436" offset="14585120">As Justice Breyer made clear in his opinion in the Geier case, he said, under ordinary obstacle principles, a State might be able to make you liable for using the Federally required windshield retention requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.696" offset="14646142">Obviously, there is no Federal requirement to sell cars.</text>
