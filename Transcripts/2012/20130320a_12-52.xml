            <text syncTime="12.323" offset="155390">The issue in this case is whether Section 14501 of the United States Transportation Code expressly preempts the Respondent's State law consumer protection in tort claims for damages against a tow trucker who towed his vehicle lawfully and then, several months later, disposed of the vehicle after the fees for towing and storage had not been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.481" offset="276075">Both of these claims are preempted because they are directed at the conduct -- the type of conduct that tow truck companies all over this country every day engage in, in dealing with a particular type of tow that's referred to in the business as nonconsensual tows.</text>

            <text syncTime="70.795" offset="389342">Is this a law that applies only to the towing companies who tow the automobile and then store it, or does the law apply, say, to a garage, say, someone brings a car to a garage for repairs, and does this storage law regulate garage operations as well as towing operations?</text>

            <text syncTime="107.689" offset="536882">Well, if a garage operator came into possession of an abandoned motor vehicle, then I suppose it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.576" offset="564467">If -- if you look at the -- at the title to this subchapter of this New Hampshire statute, the title is abandoned vehicles, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="121.622" offset="592575">Yes, but what made it abandoned was that they tried to locate the owner, couldn't and so -- this same thing could happen with a garage owner as happened to the towing truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.383" offset="639700">So there's nothing peculiar about being in the towing business that makes this storage application -- storage statute apply.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andre D. Bouffard</label>
            <text syncTime="141.926" offset="673868">Well, let me be clear about this statute, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.266" offset="691213">It's an abandoned vehicle statute, and what's really important to understand with this case is that none of the Plaintiff's claims rely on this abandoned vehicle statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.195" offset="738861">The Plaintiff has pled in his complaint a couple of allegations of violations of this abandoned vehicle law, but the substantive rights that were sued upon by the Plaintiff in this case do not live in the abandoned motor vehicle law.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.251" offset="815138">The substantive rights that were sued upon by the Plaintiff live in the State's consumer protection law, which is a separate New Hampshire statute, unrelated to the abandoned vehicle law.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.512" offset="864144">And secondly, the claim that the -- the common law negligence claim in this case arises out of the common law of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.401" offset="903746">It doesn't arise out of the abandoned motor vehicle law.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.024" offset="918270">One of the sources of confusion, I would submit, in the New Hampshire Supreme Court's decision is that it did not adequately deal with the -- the role of the abandoned vehicle law in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.702" offset="984934">The abandoned vehicle law actually plays a relatively minor role as it relates to the causes of action that were pled in this case and the causes of action that the preemption defense is directed to in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.057" offset="1058391">The reason -- the reason why these claims are preempted, Your Honor, is because they all stem from the towing of the vehicle, which was followed by the storage of the vehicle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2094.939" offset="8485839">So there was a tension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.691" offset="8488869">So in Travelers we went to, well, we have to take a look at what the manifest intent of Congress was for the regulatory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="2552.810" offset="10317336">So, what the Supreme Court of New Hampshire said is,</text>

"</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.815" offset="10421408">I also believe that the Petitioner has basically given up the case and conceded the case in several places in their brief and in here in oral argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.342" offset="10459442">If you look at page 34 of the Petitioner's brief, it says that most -- that</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.043" offset="10482325">"The most that Dan's City really can say is that the services within the meaning of Section 14501(c)(1) includes activities that are incidental and distinct from the actual transportation services. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.037" offset="10530286">So, the Petitioner's brief is calling the storage afterwards, after the transportation has stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.692" offset="10552856">And -- and they call it incidental and distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.692" offset="10560902">In the reply brief at page 21, they say,</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.330" offset="10575426">"Moreover, criminal laws prohibiting theft are not the kind of burdensome State economic regulation Congress sought to prevent with the FAAAA, nor are abandoned vehicle laws such as New Hampshire Chapter 262 in its regulations which do not hamper the operations of tow truckers; instead, they establish procedures for the efficient handling and disposition of abandoned vehicles. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.370" offset="10659644">So they're conceding that RSA 262 in this case, the statute does not have a specific impact, so this is not a clear case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2664.702" offset="10764970">Congress deregulated the trucking industry to eliminate undue interference with market forces and consumer choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.277" offset="10791197">But market forces and consumer choice cannot operate on the sale of nonconsensually towed cars, and there's little reason to think that Congress intended to preempt State laws that regulate that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.678" offset="10840830">This Court in this case, as in many preemption cases involving the phrase “ related to ”, must engage in a -- in a process of sensible line drawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.034" offset="10882208">Everything is related to everything else in the literal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.688" offset="10896836">And the Court in Travelers suggested that the Court should not -- courts should not use uncritical literalism in determining the scope of a preemption provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.591" offset="10932467">I think that this Court does have some work to do in this case, but a lot of the groundwork has already been laid in the Rowe case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.259" offset="10959112">In Rowe, this Court held that a State law is related to a motor carrier service if the State law either directly regulates the service or if it has an indirect connection with the service and a significant -- forbidden significant effect on Congress's deregulatory and preemptive objectives.</text>

            <text syncTime="2766.050" offset="11170286">I mean, why isn't that fairly directly related to the service they provide?</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.868" offset="11413643">And the reasons for that are as follows: First, let me start with the statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.133" offset="11430675">The statute defines “ transportation ” as</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.945" offset="11441855">"services related to the transportation of property. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.020" offset="11458155">And storage has been in the Interstate Commerce Act for over 100 years, the term “ storage ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.203" offset="11486890">And for over 100 years this Court has construed disputes concerning storage and considered whether or not Federal law governed or State law governed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.094" offset="11522521">When the storage was before delivery of a package, for example, the storage was considered to be storage in transit and it was part of the transportation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.056" offset="11566302">But if the storage occurred after delivery, that was a separate service not connected with the transportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2871.555" offset="11592320">Mr. Yelin, I gave Mr. Shaughnessy a couple of hypotheticals about very onerous regulations involving storage after the towing that might very conceivably have an effect on the tower, drive up the tower's prices, conceivably even drive the tower out of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.749" offset="11661075">So how do we draw the line as between this and those kinds of things?</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.905" offset="11689705">The first is that I think the hypotheticals you gave are much more difficult cases and could very well cross the line if a State tried to indirectly influence towers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.041" offset="11734322">For example, let's assume, if I may elaborate on your hypothetical, that a State really disliked the practice of nonconsensual towing, and really wanted to try and reign it in and so imposed certain conditions on towers that would discourage them from engaging in this particular type of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.628" offset="11796598">I think that would be an indirect type of regulation, but it would, as a matter of fact, it really would impair the ability or the interest of towers to provide this service to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.331" offset="12411416">When you are talking about indirect regulation, however, that perhaps is where I think one needs to consider it on an as-applied basis, because indirect regulation by definition is not going to have an obvious direct limit on towing services and the question the Court will have to consider is whether the indirect regulation is sufficiently onerous that it does impair the provision of towing services.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.480" offset="13380036">Let me take a couple of moments to try to address some of the questions that seem to be troubling some of the Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.695" offset="13408875">Justice Breyer, the simple answer to why local traffic safety laws wouldn't be preempted is that there's an exemption for the safety regulatory authority of States in the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andre D. Bouffard</label>
            <text syncTime="3342.282" offset="13475226">And, Justice Kagan, the reason why this -- this case goes over the line and is preempted is because what the Plaintiff's damages claims in this case seek to do is they seek to enforce duties that go well beyond what even the New Hampshire abandoned vehicle law requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.644" offset="13576686">They seek to impose duties of reasonable care to seek out the owner of the vehicle; they -- the -- the -- the negligence claim seeks to impose a duty to act -- a duty of reasonable care in disposing of the vehicle; and -- and a duty of reasonable care to return the vehicle to Mr. Pelkey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.871" offset="13657561">And those duties and what has been a breach of those duties will be determined by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.887" offset="13677623">And so when tow truckers are faced in the future with having to live up to those sets of duties, they will never know whether or not, in any given situation, their conduct will be second-guessed as having been not reasonable by a jury and they will be subjected to damages claims by plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.235" offset="13775112">Under the -- the abandoned vehicle law, the rule is very simple in New Hampshire and under -- and in many other jurisdictions -- pay, or your vehicle can be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.668" offset="13820774">It's a very simple rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.860" offset="14089522">And the Department of Motor Vehicles then looks at the information that's provided and then instructs the tower about the process of whether or not the vehicle can -- can be sold without notice, or if it -- if notice is required, what notice is required.</text>
