            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="108544">Justice Scalia has the opinion of the Court in our first case this term, No. 11-192, United States versus Bormes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="9.379" stopTime="293.064">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="9.379" offset="146056">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.460" offset="166327">Respondent, James Bormes, is an attorney who filed a putative class action against the United States in District Court, seeking damages under the Fair Credit Reporting Act of FCRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.403" offset="230066">Bormes alleged that he paid a $350 federal court filing fee for a client using his own credit card on pay.gov, the email thing, which is an interest-based system used by federal courts to process online payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.263" offset="313553">According to Bormes, his pay.gov electronic receipt included the last four digits of his credit card in addition to its expiration date, which he says is in willful violation of FCRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.064" offset="376769">FCRA provides among other things that receipt can have “no more than the last five digits of the card number or the expiration date.”</text>
            <text syncTime="77.979" offset="420446">Bormes sought damages under the Act which imposes civil liability on “any person who willfully fails to comply with its requirements and defines any person to include any government or governmental subdivision or agency.”</text>
            <text syncTime="95.451" offset="490245">FCRA contains its own jurisdictional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.057" offset="504769">Section 1681(p) of Title 15 authorizes suit to enforce liability “in any United States District Court without regard to the amount of controversy or in any other court of competent jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="114.590" offset="566836">Bormes asserted jurisdiction under this provision, as well as under the Little Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C Section 1346(a)(2), which grants District Court's original jurisdiction concurrent with the Court of Federal Claims of “any civil action or claim against the United States not exceeding $10,000 in amount founded upon any Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.763" offset="679581">The District Court dismissed the suit holding that FCRA does not contain the explicit waiver of sovereign immunity necessary to permit damages action against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.979" offset="720436">But the Federal Circuit vacated the District Court's decision without deciding whether FCRA itself contained the necessary immunity waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.518" offset="758575">The Court held that Little Tucker Act provided the Government's consent to suit for violation of FCRA because FCRA “can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained.”</text>
            <text syncTime="178.453" offset="822314">We granted certiorari and today vacate the federal court's -- the Federal Circuit's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.024" offset="848541">The Little Tucker Act is one statute that provides the Federal Government's consent to suit for certain money damages claims premised on other sources of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.716" offset="891382">The Tucker Act's jurisdictional grant and the company immunity waiver supplies the missing ingredient for an action against the United States for the breach of monetary obligations that would not otherwise be enforceable in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.978" offset="956374">But a detailed remedial scheme supercedes the gap-filling role and general terms of the -- of the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.937" offset="988244">FCRA's provision set out a cause of action for damages liability and defines the appropriate form for judicial enforcement, whereas in FCRA, a statute contains its own self-executing remedial scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.217" offset="1045400">We look only to that statute to determine whether Congress intended to subject the United States to damages liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.706" offset="1075284">We do not decide today whether FCRA itself waives the Federal Government's immunity to damages actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.587" offset="1102869">That is a question to be considered on remand, but whether or not FCRA contains the necessary waiver, any attempt to append a Tucker Act remedy to the statute's existing remedial scheme interferes with the scope of liability Congress intended under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.782" offset="1171623">The Federal Circuit was therefore wrong to conclude that the Tucker Act justified applying a more relaxed sovereign immunity analysis to FCRA than our cases required.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.880" offset="1212061">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion which -- which would include transfer of the case to the appropriate federal court other than the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.341" offset="1269844">The Court's decision is unanimous.</text>
