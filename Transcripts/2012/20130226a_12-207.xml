            <text syncTime="2616.136" offset="10570240">So the search incident to arrest doctrine permits searches for officer safety, to prevent destruction of evidence, and at least in the vehicular context, to search for evidence related to the offense of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.694" offset="10620500">Now, none of those rationales apply here, and I would note parenthetically that in Schmerber v. California, this Court suggested that the search incident to arrest doctrine would not permit searches into the body.</text>

            <text syncTime="3163.489" offset="12759719">On the privacy side of the ledger, we certainly believe that there are profound privacy concerns associated with the government's collection of an individual's DNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.745" offset="12796709">And leaving aside the question of how much personal information is contained in the 13 loci -- and we certainly think that there is significant personal information even as to those loci -- I don't think there can be any dispute that when you evaluate the entirety of an individual's DNA, there is a great deal of personal information contained there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.092" offset="12878106">And in our view, that has to be taken into account when engaging in balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.896" offset="12897332">Now, the government's response to that is essentially the “ just trust us ” defense; namely that the government is not looking at all that information, it is only looking at a certain subset of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.287" offset="12942890">But that has never been how this Court has analyzed privacy interests, at least outside the special needs context.</text>

            <text syncTime="3411.565" offset="13751954">--I would not say that that person has a reduced expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.850" offset="13765120">What I would say is that there are certain intrusions on privacy, some of which are quite substantial, that are permissible because there are justifications unique to the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.789" offset="13804931">So in Florence, this Court permitted the strip search of an individual who is being admitted into the general jail population based on the special need of ensuring prison safety and preventing contraband from being introduced into the prison.</text>

            <text syncTime="3441.850" offset="13873163">On the question of rapid DNA, the FBI estimates that we're about 18 to 24 months away from that world, and I would cite the National District Attorneys Association's amicus brief on page 20 where it discusses the -- that this is not science fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.748" offset="13956754">So we are very, very close to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.033" offset="13961874">And I wanted to just address a couple of the questions that arose during Respondent's presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.805" offset="13996983">Justice Kennedy, the State does have a compelling need and a compelling interest in knowing who is in its custody, and arrestees do not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.629" offset="14052258">We have a legitimate and compelling need to identify suspects and to aid in solving crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.802" offset="14080993">And our -- and our definition of what identification is, is somewhat broader than Respondent's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.539" offset="14103876">It's not just what his name is and what his face is and what his fingerprints show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.907" offset="14121326">It is that CODIS DNA profile, those 26 numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.608" offset="14136163">So in our view that's a broader definition of identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.714" offset="14164585">And I wanted also just finally to address Justice Alito's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.333" offset="14183079">This is the fingerprinting of the 21st century, but it's better.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.487" offset="14199693">Typically DNA evidence is used to identify rapes and murderers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.058" offset="14226025">Fingerprints typically do not solve those kinds of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.010" offset="14241803">And if the primary purpose of fingerprinting is just to identify, it also is used -- fingerprinting now is used, the prints are compared against the latent database in IAFIS and they are used to solve crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.154" offset="14310348">But they typically don't solve the kind of crimes that we are talking about here, and it wouldn't have been solved in Mr. -- in Mr. King's case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3557.458" offset="14335530">How can I base a decision today on what you tell me is going to happen in 2 years?</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.879" offset="14357264">You say, in 2 years we will have this rapid DNA available, but we don't now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.683" offset="14380460">Don't I have to base a decision on what we have today?</text>

            <text syncTime="3572.068" offset="14394044">Well, that's really only one component of our argument, Mr. Chief Justice, that certainly with respect to a bail determination we will be able to make it more rapidly at the time that rapid DNA comes into effect.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3584.026" offset="14441900">Yes, but if we believe that the purpose of it has much to do with whether it's legitimate or not, you can't demonstrate that the purpose is immediate identification of the people coming into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.904" offset="14505326">You just can't demonstrate that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.854" offset="14513163">Maybe you can in 2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.272" offset="14518805">The purpose now is -- is the purpose you began your presentation with, to catch the bad guys, which is a good thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.843" offset="14549107">But you know, the Fourth Amendment sometimes stands in the way.</text>

            <label>Ms. Katherine Winfree</label>
            <text syncTime="3614.914" offset="14565407">It has a corollary purpose, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.032" offset="14577842">What we are suggesting and arguing is that solving crimes, to be sure, is the key component, but in solving crimes and connecting an arrestee to a crime that's unsolved informs a judge's determination about whether to release that individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.458" offset="14639595">And as Mr. Dreeben said, bail modifications can happen, they do happen all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.195" offset="14662478">And in Maryland, it's going to have -- it's going to be happening before rapid DNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.397" offset="14679301">Right now we are able to make that determination in a period between 11 and 17 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.635" offset="14696333">So we are not asking you to base your decision on the futuristic world, which is really only 2 years out with rapid DNA anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.122" offset="14726217">But we can make those bail determinations now and in fact they are important for where we house prisoners and how we supervise them in custody.</text>
