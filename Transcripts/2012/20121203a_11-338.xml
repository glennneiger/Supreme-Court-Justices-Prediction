            <text syncTime="1535.175" offset="6246894">But with respect to the other two elements of relief, I think those can be easily dealt with as a matter of law; that is, to the extent that they are seeking an injunction ordering that no further discharges occur without a permit, then clearly the propriety of that sort of injunction would be determined under the new rule, and it wouldn't be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.338" offset="6323590">And I think Laidlaw is clear that the only basis that a citizen has for seeking civil penalties is to deter future violations, not to punish prior violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.367" offset="6503626">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.735" offset="6513134">It seems to me, in light of the recent events, that the most appropriate course for this Court is to just simply dismiss this case as improvidently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.906" offset="6545840">If this Court had reached its -- had gotten a cert petition under the circumstances present right now, it seems to me there'd be three very strong reasons simply just to deny the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.114" offset="6582620">First of all, because EPA, in its rulemaking on Friday afternoon, itself says that the Ninth Circuit decision has -- cancels out any impact of the Ninth Circuit decision on the ground moving forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.320" offset="6627446">Second of all, the case is interlocutory in posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.086" offset="6638522">Remember, we are just on a reversal of a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.405" offset="6647822">So every argument that's left in the case, in addition to whatever mootness arguments anyone wants to make, which I'll explain why in a moment we would disagree with, can all be made on remand to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.495" offset="6692125">And if people are unhappy -- or not on remand, but just simply when the case returns -- if people are unhappy with those results, they can bring the case back up to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.051" offset="7430346">But if I can finish my question -- or my answer to Justice Sotomayor, the reason why that regulation doesn't require us to go to court of appeals in the first instance and actually lets us proceed on a citizen suit is because the only two subsections of 1369(b)(1) that they have mentioned are subsections (E) and (F).</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.528" offset="7512266">Subsection (F) deals with EPA decisions, quote, “ issuing or denying a permit ”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2003.875" offset="8121650">And so under this -- the facts of this case, remember, we're on a motion to dismiss, so when Mr. Bishop says 1 or 2 weeks out of whatever, we would like to have a record on that because we don't think that's reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.331" offset="8163551">But what the case -- what we say in our complaint is that they have a contract with the State of Oregon to harvest particular areas and use particular roads to access that timber and to take it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.306" offset="8211407">And the -- and the contract actually requires them to use those roads and to maintain their drainage systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.309" offset="8231469">And so our claim -- again, just to remind you what our claim is under the statute -- is that that harvesting activity can't be thought of in any other way than industrial in nature, and that these roads are associated with that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.784" offset="8277340">They are designed for that purpose, and they're indispensable to the activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.338" offset="8295521">Now, we have a second argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.354" offset="8303567">Even if the Court thought that we couldn't win -- or a -- whatever court looks at this, thought we couldn't win on the statute, we have a Chevron step II argument that we will make, and have every right to make, because if -- I'll beg this Court's indulgence -- if -- this rule that they have just announced on Friday afternoon is not as clear as you might think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.502" offset="8384233">So if you start with the language of the rule, which is on page 18, what they have done is they have amended -- they have amended the stormwater rules to -- to provide that the only industrial activities associated with logging are sawmills, which are covered elsewhere, and then these four categories of things: Rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log storage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2124.671" offset="8604916">So they are saying those are the only industrial activities that are associated with logging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.242" offset="8627172">But that doesn't answer our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.360" offset="8639606">Our claim isn't that logging roads themselves are industrial activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.912" offset="8657787">Our claim is that logging roads are associated with industrial activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.050" offset="8674401">And so we still have a claim that, under that -- even if those are the only four industrial activities -- or, sorry, five, those four things plus sawmills -- we still have a claim that logging roads are, quote, “ immediate access roads ” to those activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.409" offset="8739812">And the definition of “ immediate access roads ”, which is unchanged by the new regulation, is at Pet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.479" offset="8764054">App. 40a -- the Ninth Circuit quoted it, and I think it was described earlier by my friend --</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.867" offset="8781608">"Roads which are exclusively or primarily dedicated for the use by the industrial facility. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.771" offset="8805222">So it's still a mystery to us how logging roads are not primarily for use by even sawmills or these other four things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.210" offset="8839077">And, indeed, if you look very carefully at EPA's new regulation in the preamble on page 6, about two-thirds of the way down the middle of the page, the only sentence here that EPA gives us that even suggests a possible response to the argument I just described is the one that begins with the word “ unlike ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.206" offset="8931028">They say:</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.992" offset="8934163">"Unlike immediate access roads associated with industrial activities, many logging roads -- many logging roads have multiple uses, including recreation and general transportation, and commonly extend over long distance, i.e., may not provide immediate access to an industrial site. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.018" offset="8998215">So EPA is leaving open our argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2381.239" offset="9631110">One is if we want to press a claim for any kind of civil penalties or remediation, the backward-looking thing would matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.160" offset="9662875">We have to decide whether we would want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.178" offset="9670920">The second way it would matter would be it would provide a helpful baseline for judging the new rule in the totality of EPA action, which brings me to my -- which brings me back to the argument I was describing, which would be our Chevron step II argument, that EPA has simply either left this argument open -- I still -- it is still a mystery to us what EPA thinks about our real argument, which is that active hauling logging roads, when they are being used for active harvesting and hauling, are subject to the Act because they are plainly associated with industrial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.149" offset="9798816">And if EPA later on came out and said, no, no, no, we mean to exclude that, too, then, we respectfully submit, EPA would still have a lot of explaining to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.791" offset="9841343">First of all, we would very much wonder why log sorting, log storage, gravel washing and rock crushing are industrial activities, but mechanized timber harvesting with 20-ton pieces of machinery is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.014" offset="9898290">We'd also wonder why this stuff isn't industrial activity where construction activity, landfill operations, surface mining operations that have all the same attributes of being done out in the field, extraction of resources, heavy machinery, etcetera, are, as the EPA itself admits, industrial activity; but, somehow, somehow, logging, which has all the same attributes, isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.016" offset="10006228">And so that's what our claim is going forward now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.051" offset="10014378">I'm not asking this Court to address that because I'm not sure this Court wants to get into all of this stuff yet; but, what I am telling this Court is, there is no basis whatsoever to find this case is moot, or I don't think this Court would want to touch any of the arguments being made here without further briefing, at least as to the new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.131" offset="10098702">We do think it's absolutely clear we are dealing with point sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.685" offset="10112912">We do think it's absolutely clear, based on the language of 1369(b)(1), that there just can't be any way that there is a jurisdictional or whatever other kind of problem you want to label it with us bringing a claim based on the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.528" offset="10180308">The new regulation just simply doesn't fall into those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.312" offset="10191384">So if this Court dismisses the case, we'll go to the Ninth Circuit and tell them we want to go forward for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.585" offset="10224507">And if anybody is unhappy with what happens in the Ninth Circuit, obviously, we can file or they can file petitions for cert in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.274" offset="10259302">Let me just say one last thing to this Court about what we view as really the arbitrary and capricious nature of EPA's new rule and why you shouldn't touch it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.916" offset="10305800">Remember, I said -- and this is in EPA's regulations themselves -- that construction activity, any construction activity in a site five acres or more is industrial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.806" offset="10353448">So if a developer buys a parcel of forested land and wants to build a subdivision there, and the first thing the developer does is punch in some roads and drainage systems and cut some trees down to make room for the houses, that is covered by the EPA's stormwater rules; but, if a logging company does precisely the same thing, EPA's position seems to be it's not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.820" offset="10441428">And not only is it not covered if it happens on public land, but I think at least the implication of my friend's position is that for logging companies, of which there are many in the northwest, that own their own land, own their own giant pieces of forest land, and that are not open to the public, that are not open to hunters, that are not open to recreation, but they have their own logging roads on their own private lands that nobody can use but them, I still think his position is that's not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.637" offset="10548739">And finally, EPA has one other thing that I want to point out to the Court about this new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.393" offset="10575802">And it's, again, got our heads -- it gets our heads scratching as to what EPA is really doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.047" offset="10602342">EPA says twice in the preamble to their new rule, once on page 7 and also on page 12, that it, quote, retains the authority to designate at least some logging roads as covered by its so-called point -- Phase II system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.877" offset="10681650">What the Phase II system is, is under Section 1342(p), which is the stormwater amendments to the Act, it's the category of point source discharges that EPA says are not a covered -- are not industrial activity, associated industrial activity, but we nonetheless are going to require certain things of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.557" offset="10772452">This is the critical point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.909" offset="10781856">EPA says this twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.778" offset="10789275">Well, the only authority EPA would have to regulate any logging roads, discharges from logging roads, is if they are point sources, because you don't get into the Phase II program, you don't get into the stormwater amendments unless you have a point source.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.156" offset="10858760">If it's a non-point source, then, as my friend has pointed out quite at length in his brief, it's entirely up to the State and EPA has nothing to say about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2744.676" offset="11084876">I don't know if it's walking away from that or is planning on walking away from that, but again there is a variety of questions I think that EPA should have to address and answer -- Did you have one?</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.032" offset="11122284">I'm sorry -- that EPA should have to address and answer before any court does anything based on this new rule.</text>
