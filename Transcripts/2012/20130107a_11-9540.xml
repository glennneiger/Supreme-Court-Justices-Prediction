            <text syncTime="118.390" offset="579559">But assuming for the sake of argument that that is an element, one way for the California court to express that is to say simply, as it has, that an element is the violation of the possessory interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.965" offset="633789">Another way of saying exactly the same thing would be to say that the term “ enters ” under the California burglary statute means either breaking into a structure or the violation of the possessory interest in some other way.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.326" offset="1007235">In California you don't have to have a trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.560" offset="1016222">And as the Court indicated in the Taylor decision, it talked about shoplifting in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.163" offset="1038582">So is a shoplifter someone who should be subject to an Armed Career Criminal Act enhancement?</text>

            <text syncTime="291.686" offset="1272744">But I don't believe California burglary does that, because the entry with intent to commit a crime is burglary in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.242" offset="1310883">Is there a difference -- what the California court has said is that an element is the violation of a possessory interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.063" offset="1342230">Assuming for the sake of argument that is correct, that is a correct statement of California law, is there any substantive difference between saying that and saying the element is breaking or, in the alternative, the violation of a possessory interest in some other way?</text>

            <text syncTime="335.465" offset="1447869">It's not an element of the crime.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="336.865" offset="1453407">Mr. Johnson, can I try what Justice Alito is getting at maybe in a slightly a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.285" offset="1471066">And it's really the argument that the Ninth Circuit made, which is that you can take any indivisible statute, indivisible statute, and you can reimagine it as a statute with divisible elements, and Justice Alito gave one example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.096" offset="1542328">And the question to the Ninth Circuit says, is, once we've said that we can look to Shepard documents when we have a divisible statute, why not apply the same reasoning when we have an indivisible statute, given that any indivisible statute can kind of be reframed in our heads as a divisible one?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dan B. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="381.946" offset="1633756">Well, because in that case, the jury -- if a statute is made where the question is, is a weapon involved, and you can commit that with an ax, a gun, or a knife, but the element is weapon, the jury is only required to find weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.375" offset="1719438">And if gun is -- is the fact that needs to be shown for an active predicate, you don't get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.179" offset="1746710">Again, you go back to the element, what's the person convicted of.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.465" offset="1759771">They would be convicted of a weapon violation, not a gun violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.424" offset="6479680">I would like to start maybe at a point in a colloquy that my friend was having with Justice Breyer, which brought out the point that Petitioner's position here is that there's a difference between alternative elements in State crimes and alternative means; and from the point of view of a guilty plea, which is what we're dealing with here, I don't see how you're going to make that sort of distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.790" offset="6577169">It's an unworkable distinction, because, from -- from the point of view of the defendant pleading guilty, whether it's an alternative element or an alternative means, it's just an alternative way of offering the factual basis for the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.514" offset="6623980">And the sentencing court ought to look, as the Court, as this Court said in Shepard, to the factual basis that's offered for pleading guilty.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="1637.203" offset="6654804">But you're not -- but you're not looking at the factual basis for the purpose of deciding the manner in which the defendant committed the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.142" offset="6686569">You're looking to the factual basis or you look to these other documents in order to decide which crime it was that the offender committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.248" offset="6726902">And the reason that you have to sometimes do that is because there are many State statutes which under a single section number list several different crimes, where “ crime ” here does not refer to a thing that happened at a particular day at a particular time, but refers to the kind of thing that a statute defines; i.e., a general category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.815" offset="6829198">Now, every case that we've written it seems to me says that or is consistent with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.719" offset="6856783">And that is certainly consistent with the idea of the crimes being burglary, arson, explosives, or other dangerous crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.694" offset="6904744">So the guilty plea is beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.646" offset="6916551">It may just say: Guilty of 828 376 Section 42-BC, end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.018" offset="6954063">And we don't know which of those three things: House, car, boat, which are there in that section, was the crime committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.224" offset="12150863">It's because at common law, of course, there was a strict breaking requirement, and as this Court recognized in Taylor, and in going back to the LaFave treatise in -- in Taylor, that requirement had over the years and into modern statutes been relaxed to include not only strict breakings, but also entries by fraud, entries by threat and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.339" offset="12243337">Gauze -- and the reasoning in Gauze explains that the California legislature's codification of burglary simply does that relaxation a little bit better, by adding essentially one more category of Gauze -- taken with subsequent decisions about shoplifting and such -- explains California just did that one better by adding another category, which is entries that exceed the implied consent to enter public places for lawful purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.688" offset="12344692">So what you're left with here is, this case exists at the common law core that both California and generic burglary retain, which is an entry by break -- an entry by breaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.797" offset="12401116">And it is true that both generic burglary is dispensed with that requirement, in the sense that it allows other thing to qualify, and so, too, California has dispensed with that requirement, but it hasn't completely eliminated the relevance entirely of the lawfulness of the entry.</text>
