            <text syncTime="21.629" offset="191877">The Florida supreme court answered that question by erecting what we think is an extraordinary set of evidentiary requirements that, in effect, puts the dog on trial in any suppression hearing in which defendant chooses to challenge the reliability of the dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.173" offset="254153">I think, most fundamentally, the problem with the court of appeals' -- the Supreme Court's decision -- is that it misconceives what this Court's cases conceive of the probable cause requirement, converting probable cause, which this Court has referred to as a substantial chance or fair probability of the detection of contraband or evidence of a crime, into what amounts to a continuously updated batting average and a requirement that dogs be virtually infallible.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.843" offset="584759">And Aldo, the dog in this case, clearly was.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.795" offset="596566">He'd received a 120-hour training program with the police department in Apopka, Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.920" offset="637108">And he was subjected to continuous weekly training, in which part of that training consisted of taking him out, walking him by some vehicles that contained cars, some vehicles that didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.709" offset="676292">And the testimony of Officer Wheetley was that Aldo's performance was really good.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.227" offset="694368">And what he meant by that was that if there were eight cars with drugs.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.570" offset="743688">The dog subsequently was recertified.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.554" offset="751629">Our position is that the Fourth Amendment doesn't impose an annual certification requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.924" offset="777124">I think, more important in this case was the fact that the dog was continuously trained, continuously evaluated and trained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.815" offset="5484703">The kind of burden that that might impose on law enforcement we don't think is justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.184" offset="5502153">That's a separate question from whether the defendant can ask the handler, if the handler is on the stand, about field performance, and then the court can give that answer whatever weight is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.509" offset="5547397">We think, typically, an answer on field performance is not going to be material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.646" offset="5564011">It's not going to be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.063" offset="5569653">Because the problem is in the field, when a dog alerts, the dog is trained to alert to the odor of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.882" offset="5596925">It's like a -- what the -- Florida supreme court wanted a batting average, a batting average that would be calculated when we know the number of at bats, but we don't know in many cases whether there was a hit or an out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.559" offset="5647603">So we had a fraction where we know the denominator but not the numerator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.928" offset="5661082">The answer to the Florida supreme court's question and concern about reliability, again, is to go back to the controlled setting, where we know what's a hit and what's an out, and we can calculate a reliable batting average.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.319" offset="5710715">That needs to be where the focus should be in determining the reliability of a dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.640" offset="5731926">And there should -- there's no reason to constitutionalize the process or the training methodologies that get you to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.376" offset="5758884">What matters is, is this dog successful in a setting in which we can measure success.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.447" offset="5779155">And I think that it's also important to point out that the Florida court was basically alone in establishing these unprecedented and inflexible sets of evidentiary requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.040" offset="5837565">There is a large body of case law in the lower courts on the reliability of drug detection dogs going back 30 or 40 years, and there are no other courts, no other appellate courts to be sure, that have imposed these kinds of requirements on law enforcement when it seeks to establish probable cause for a detection -- for after a detection dog alerts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1496.663" offset="6092102">But I think it's critical, as Mr. Garre pointed out, that the courts not constitutionalize dog training methodologies or hold mini trials with expert witnesses on what makes for a successful dog training program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.837" offset="6136720">Because, as Mr. Garre said, the Government has critical interests, life and death interests, that it stakes on the reliability of these dogs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.158" offset="6166081">So the U.S. Marshals use dogs to protect Federal judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.777" offset="6180501">The Federal Protective Services use dogs to keep bombs out of Federal buildings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.004" offset="6245389">So, in situation after situation, the government has in a sense put its money where its mouth is, and it believes at an institutional level that these dogs are quite reliable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.057" offset="10597598">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.040" offset="10601568">And -- and the difference is that -- that the police officer can describe what he has smelled and can say, I smell marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.978" offset="10629363">All the dog tells the police officer is, I smell something I was trained to detect, perhaps, if I'm operating correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.917" offset="10661128">But getting to this -- this issue of residual odor, our position is that an alert where no drugs are found means that the dog -- that -- it detracts from probable cause in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.160" offset="10718075">But that's not the only rule available to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.696" offset="10728210">Residual odor, whether an alert was to residual odor and is therefore correct and accurate, is something that can be litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.015" offset="10757467">In one of the lower courts that decided the case after the Florida supreme court, the court looked to the field performance records, and it found several of them well supported on the issue of whether the alert was probably to the odor of drugs; several it didn't find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.894" offset="10820997">So that is an issue that can be litigated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2760.013" offset="11145438">I'd like to talk briefly about the Oregon supreme court and what that court did in several cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.404" offset="11195071">Helzer and Foster decided in 2011, independently of the Florida supreme court decision, doesn't cite -- in Foster, the Oregon supreme court had a dog that trained initially with the same handler, unlike here, where the evidence was very strong as to the features of the training and certification program, and where that dog had, I believe, a 66 percent field performance record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.821" offset="11296739">Now, the court in Foster said that the dog's reliability can be established by training, certification, and performance in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.891" offset="11329026">The court added that it didn't think that performance in the field was the most reliable measure, but it's relevant, and the court considered that 66 percent percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.949" offset="11369255">But then, on the same day, in Helzer, there was a dog that trained initially with a different handler, that the handler ultimately testified to very few details of the ongoing training and the certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.375" offset="11426933">In Foster, the certification was with an organization that required a 90 percent success rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.327" offset="11446682">In Helzer, there was no such testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.796" offset="11456608">And this officer, like the officer here, didn't keep field performance records when the dog alerted and no drugs were found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.052" offset="11489627">In Helzer, the court found that there was insufficient evidence of reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.170" offset="11506137">And I believe that those two cases demonstrate what is a -- what is a correct line to draw in navigating what is reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.776" offset="11540514">On several arguments made by the State, the argument was that the maintenance training included blanks, and that the dog did not alert to blanks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.167" offset="11590042">The record, we believe, supports the Florida supreme court's conclusion that blanks were tested -- the dog was tested on blanks, but there was no testimony as to whether the dog didn't alert on those blanks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.510" offset="11639466">The State has said that the dog was subsequently recertified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.312" offset="11658692">I don't find support in the record for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.181" offset="11670186">At a suppression hearing, the State argued -- the officer testified that the dog was scheduled for another certification, but we don't know whether the dog was ever recertified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.770" offset="11708533">The Court can affirm the Florida supreme court simply on the failure to produce adequate documentation of certification and initial training, and on the fact that this dog was never certified with this trainer -- with this handler and didn't initially work with this handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.516" offset="11783453">You don't have a dog here who was reliable enough to demonstrate probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.802" offset="11800589">The Florida supreme court so concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.104" offset="11809784">I believe its conclusion was correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.482" offset="12695335">First, probable cause in this Court's precedents looks not only to the likelihood that contraband would be present, but the likelihood that there would be evidence of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.421" offset="12731071">And that would include the so-called residual odor, evidence that drug paraphernalia, someone had recently smoked illegal narcotics in the vehicle, or the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.276" offset="12770568">So the alert to the so-called residual odor of drugs is just as probative to the question of probable cause as an alert to drugs themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.232" offset="12806303">The fact that Aldo alerted to the door handle area of the car doesn't negate in any way the probable cause that Officer Wheetley had to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.988" offset="12841412">What it means is that the door handle area was where the scent of the illegal narcotics was the strongest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.059" offset="12861683">It could have been narcotics coming out of that area, or coming out of the door seam, or could have been the fact that someone who had used narcotics was using the door handle to get in and out of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.515" offset="12903479">Second, courts can determine reliability in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.985" offset="12917376">They would look to the performance in the controlled training environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.853" offset="12932840">There is a real danger with suggesting that field performance records are -- are a permissible foray for defendants in suppression hearings to challenge the reliability of dogs because, one, as Justice Alito pointed out, it's not a controlled setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.398" offset="12998982">We don't know whether the dog did alert to residual odors of narcotics that had been in the car, drugs that were hidden and simply not found during the relatively--</text>

            <text syncTime="3238.742" offset="13060422">And that would be a huge deterrent to law enforcement, even maintaining those records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.877" offset="13076932">Third, Officer Wheetley and Aldo did train together for nearly a year before the search in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.180" offset="13102114">They did complete the 40-hour drug detection seminar at the Dothan, Alabama, police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.953" offset="13129177">And that certificate's at page 105 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.536" offset="13139521">And second, as Justice Scalia pointed out, all the incentives in this area are aligned with ensuring the reliability of drug detection dogs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.511" offset="13179436">It's not in the police interest to have a dog that is inaccurate in finding contraband or that is inaccurate and putting an officer in harm's way.</text>
