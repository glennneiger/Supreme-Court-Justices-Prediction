            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">In case 12-307, United States verus Windsor, Justice Kennedy has the opinion of the Court.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.027" offset="134604">Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer were married in a lawful ceremony in Ontario, Canada in 2007.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.371" offset="167936">They returned to their home in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.021" offset="178489">Their same-sex marriage is recognized as lawful under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.696" offset="201268">When Spyer died in 2009, she left her entire estate to Windsor.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.756" offset="221435">Windsor sought to claim the federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.776" offset="245572">She was barred from doing so, however, by a federal law, the Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.507" offset="276501">Section 3 of DOMA excludes the same-sex partner from the definition of spouse as that term is used in federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.412" offset="312132">Section 3 does not expressly forbid states from permitting same-sex marriages or civil unions or providing state benefits to residents in that status.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.615" offset="352883">But Section 3's comprehensive definition of marriage controls over 1,000 federal laws in which marital status is addressed including the estate tax exemption law of spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.288" offset="407636">Windsor paid the estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.591" offset="412860">She then filed a suit for a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.522" offset="420488">The basis for refund claim is that Section 3 of DOMA, depriving her of spousal status, is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.372" offset="447969">While the refund suit was pending, the Attorney General of the United States notified the Speaker of the House of Representatives that the Department of Justice would no longer defend the constitutionality of Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.371" offset="499900">The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the House of Representatives, as BLAG, Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group voted to intervene in the litigation to defend the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.197" offset="551205">The District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Section 3 is unconstitutional and ordered the United States to pay Windsor a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.996" offset="590388">The first issue to be addressed in the case that is here is whether a justiciable case or controversy still remains once the executive branch decides it no longer will defend the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.277" offset="639603">Today, the court concludes that a controversy does remain so there is jurisdiction to review the District Court ruling and the ruling of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.399" offset="680040">The United States retains a stake in the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.973" offset="694356">The refund still is not been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.689" offset="701252">There will be a legal injury to the government if the refund is ordered or legal injury to the taxpayer if it's not, that the executive may welcome a constitutional ruling invalidating the statute does not eliminate the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.126" offset="754960">The government has standing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.414" offset="764050">The Court need not decide whether BLAG has independent standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.840" offset="781814">The capable defense of the law by BLAG in this Court does ensure that there is and was a full argument on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.891" offset="826013">This case is of immediate importance to the federal government and to hundred of thousands of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.606" offset="844821">So the Court's conclusion that this case maybe heard on the merits does not imply that no difficulties would ensue if the executive were to decline to defend statute in a more ordinary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.220" offset="895289">As there is jurisdiction, the substantive issue of the validity of DOMA's Section 3 must be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.304" offset="931652">In recent years, the limitation of lawful marriage to heterosexual couples, a limitation which for centuries had been deemed both necessary and fundamental, came to be seen in New York and certain other states as an unjust exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.781" offset="1001556">These states have decided that same-sex couple should have the right to marry and so live with pride in themselves and in their union, in a status of equality with all other married persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.236" offset="1059338">State laws defining and regulating marriage must respect the constitutional rights of persons, but subject to those constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.004" offset="1090476">Regulation of domestic relations is around that has long been recognized as a virtually exclusive province of the states and the recognition of civil marriages is central to state domestic relations law applicable to its residents and citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.185" offset="1159231">Against this background of lawful same-sex marriage in some states, the design, purpose, and effect of DOMA should be considered in determining whether it is valid under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.314" offset="1211685">Section 3 of DOMA rejects the long established preset that the incidents, benefits, and obligations of marriages are uniform for all married couples within each state.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.551" offset="1260690">Limited federal laws that define the meaning of marriage in order to further federal policy can be constitutional, but DOMA has a far greater reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.619" offset="1300919">Its operation is directed to a class of persons that the laws of 12 states have sought to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.934" offset="1326205">It is unnecessary, however, to decide whether this federal intrusion on state power is a violation of the Constitution because it disrupts the federal balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.763" offset="1361523">A different constitutional principle does control.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.769" offset="1377510">When the State of New York used its historic and essential authority to define the marital relation to include same-sex couples, the state's role and the state's power in making a decision enhanced the recognition, dignity, and protection of the class of married same-sex couples in their own community.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.869" offset="1453892">The federal government uses the state defined class for the opposite purpose, to impose restrictions and disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.180" offset="1483149">What the State of New York treats as alike, the federal law deems unlike.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.166" offset="1499136">It does so by a federal law designed to injure the same class the state seeks to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.348" offset="1519825">In doing so, the federal law violates basic Due Process and Equal Protection principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.992" offset="1542395">The avowed purpose and practical effect of the law or to impose a disadvantage, a separate status and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.346" offset="1607805">The history of DOMA's enactment in its own text demonstrate that interference with the equal dignity of the same-sex marriages, the dignity conferred by the states in the exercise of their sovereign power was more than an incidental effect of the federal statute, it was its essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.907" offset="1678023">The stated purpose of the law was to promote an interest in protecting the traditional moral teachings reflected in heterosexual only marriage laws, where there any doubt of this far-reaching purpose, the title of the act confirms at the defense of marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.793" offset="1733611">In short, the act's demonstrated purpose is to ensure that if any state decides to recognize same-sex marriages, those unions will be treated as second class marriages for purposes of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.368" offset="1775929">By creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same state, Section 3 of DOMA forces same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose of state law, but unmarried for the purpose of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.551" offset="1820651">This diminishes the stability and predictability of basic personal relations the state has found it proper to acknowledge and protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.298" offset="1851685">No legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the state by its marriage laws sought to protect in personhood and dignity.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.749" offset="1889405">By seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriage as less respected than others, Section 3 of DOMA is in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.643" offset="1929007">This opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful marriages.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.904" offset="1946039">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.452" offset="1960249">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.965" offset="1970280">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas joins and in which the Chief Justice joins in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.291" offset="1995567">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas joins in part.</text>
