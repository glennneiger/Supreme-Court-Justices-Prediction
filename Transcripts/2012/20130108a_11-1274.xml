            <text syncTime="9.939" offset="146004">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.574" offset="164499">This case concerns the statute dealing exclusively with penalty claims brought by government agencies to punish conduct made unlawful by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.083" offset="214549">Congress provided a clear and easily administered statutory time limitation on the Government's power to punish: 5 years, except as otherwise provided by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.743" offset="273168">The case does not concern -- the statute does not concern the Government's power to seek remedial remedies such as disgorgement and injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.049" offset="314442">Consistent with Congress's normal approach in penal situations, Congress fixed a statute of limitations for penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.005" offset="350282">The court below, for the first time over the century the statute has been in existence, sweepingly concluded that unless Congress clearly directed otherwise, the statute and the 5 years did not begin to run from the time the defendant violated the law, the ordinary rule for statutes providing for accrual, but instead--</text>

            <text syncTime="90.324" offset="467519">Mr. Liman, you -- you are typing this a penalty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.414" offset="495940">The government says the accrual is the ordinary rule, but discovery is the rule in this Court, and so it is alleged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.685" offset="533034">So how does the Court decide whether to type this case a penalty case, as you urge, or a fraud case, as the government urged -- urges, when both captions fit?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lewis J. Liman</label>
            <text syncTime="121.778" offset="593325">--Your Honor, I think there are two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.747" offset="609207">First is that the Court doesn't need to decide, Congress has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.781" offset="629374">Congress made it quite clear that the rule of accrual applied to all penalty claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.202" offset="655078">And as this Court held in Clark v. Martinez, the same word in a statute cannot be given different interpretations depending on the underlying statute to which it is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.362" offset="703666">The second reason, though, Justice Ginsburg, is that it is not correct to say -- and this Court has never said -- that either the Bailey rule or the injury accrual rule applies to a statutory fraud claim where the government is seeking to punish.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.574" offset="780571">That would--</text>

            <text syncTime="170.456" offset="788094">Justice Ginsburg points out that you're talking about the statute, but the statute uses the term “ accrual ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.746" offset="821217">Is it correct to say the term “ accrual ” is not used in statute of limitations for crimes -- generally -- for crimes?</text>

            <text syncTime="190.953" offset="870014">--For -- for crimes, the general word that is used is time period from the violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.425" offset="903973">And this -- and this talks about accrual.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.159" offset="910869">So that is indicative -- is indicative of the fact that Congress is using a civil analogue in the drafting of this statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lewis J. Liman</label>
            <text syncTime="209.681" offset="944933">Your Honor, it indicates that Congress is using accrual as it is understood at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.854" offset="977638">Common law, it means when the claim becomes ripe and the plaintiff has the ability to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.710" offset="1009090">What that means is, as the D.C. Circuit said in 3M -- and we think the D.C. Circuit got it right on this -- that you look to the underlying statute pursuant to which the government is seeking a penalty to see when the claim became ripe.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.171" offset="1082964">In a penalty situation, and under the IAA, which is what this concerns -- it doesn't concern a common law fraud claim; it doesn't concern a claim where there's even any element of deception that's required.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.348" offset="1143673">It's a breach of fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.883" offset="1149733">What the IAA says is that the government can sue when the violation occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.554" offset="1184424">Now--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="270.721" offset="1189126">Mr. Liman, I understand your argument, but I have a fundamental difficulty, okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="277.742" offset="1217234">Bailey and Exploration Company, with statutes not too dissimilar from this one, who read the discovery rule into a fraud claim, both were a civil litigant and for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.819" offset="1277524">The only way that I can tease out a potential difference between Exploration and this case is somehow that the penalty in this case is not for injury but for punishment, as you called it.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.148" offset="1358817">Government as enforcer, rather than government as victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.219" offset="1375118">Some of us would say that the common wheel is injured whenever someone breaks a law, so that that distinction between enforcer and victim makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.746" offset="1433214">How do you answer that point?</text>

            <text syncTime="334.681" offset="1445021">--Justice Sotomayor, let me give you the precise answer to that, which is that in this case where the government is seeking a penalty, it is not acting on behalf of underlying investors, and the recovery is not one that is brought by way of damages or disgorgement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lewis J. Liman</label>
            <text syncTime="364.617" offset="1564662">Your Honor, I think that is the articulation that the government would have to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.021" offset="1586291">I don't think it holds up, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.871" offset="1597681">First of all, it would represent an extreme departure from anything this Court has ever held or, to our knowledge, any court has ever held with respect to the application of the discovery rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.364" offset="1647731">Second, when you're talking about penalty, you're not talking about recovery to victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.868" offset="1677720">Third, when we're talking about implying a rule, which is what the Government's argument is here -- it's not an argument to follow the plain language, it's an argument to depart from the plain language -- you should look at, and the cases direct you to look at the policy concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.062" offset="1746474">And when you're talking about discover -- a discovery rule with respect to the government as enforcer, the rules don't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.287" offset="1787434">They don't work for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.054" offset="1794435">First of all, when you've got an injury, a party who is injured, the statute of limitations has a natural start date that is not in control of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.896" offset="1853785">There is a relationship to the underlying violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.985" offset="1882207">And that can be readily measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.271" offset="1895372">None of that is true when you're talking about the government in a law enforcement capacity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="453.758" stopTime="493.716">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="453.758" offset="1921286">Mr. Liman, what you suggested, when we talked about the discovery rule, is that it has a basis in the notion that a defendant with unclean hands who has committed deceptive conduct preventing the plaintiff from understanding that he or it has a cause of action, you know, shouldn't be entitled to the benefit of a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.290" offset="2015431">And if that's the understanding that lies behind the discovery rule, I guess the question for you is, why doesn't it apply in this case as well as in the case where the person bringing the action has himself suffered a harm?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lewis_j_liman" startTime="493.716" stopTime="583.560">
            <label>Mr. Lewis J. Liman</label>
            <text syncTime="493.716" offset="2081155">Justice Kagan, I've got two answers to that question as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.335" offset="2095575">The first is that -- that I don't think is the basis for -- for the discovery rule at bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.208" offset="2131101">The basis for the discovery rule -- if you look at this Court's opinion in Rotella, if you look at the Seventh Circuit in Cada, the D.C. Circuit in Connor -- is the notion that when the plaintiff cannot discover the injury, doesn't know that it's been injured and cannot reasonably know that the plaintiff's been injured, the plaintiff cannot take the steps that other plaintiffs would take to investigate and determine whether they've got a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.381" offset="2271745">That's not applicable in a government enforcement context, because you're not talking about there the government as a victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.422" offset="2311973">The government may not know of the underlying transaction, will not know of the underlying transaction, unless the government asks.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.842" offset="2345619">The second reason is that there is a strain that -- in the Bailey line of cases -- that really speaks in terms of equitable tolling and fraudulent concealment, that sort of a notion of unclean hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.537" offset="2412388">That's not in this case, because the government affirmatively took it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.958" offset="2434122">But we would submit--</text>

            <text syncTime="586.443" offset="2451989">I mean, the point here is that there was a concealment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.014" offset="6702321">And until 2004 I haven't found a single case in which the government ever tried to assert the discovery rule where what they were seeking was a civil penalty, not to try to make themselves whole where they are a victim, with one exception, a case called Maillard in the 19th century where they did make that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.498" offset="6808274">They were struck down by the district court, and the attorney general in his opinion said: The district court's absolutely right; of course, the government cannot effectively abolish the statute of limitations where what they're trying to do is to gather something that's so close to a criminal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.944" offset="13570017">What case?</text>

          <turn speaker="lewis_j_liman" startTime="3366.461" stopTime="3651.248">
            <label>Mr. Lewis J. Liman</label>
            <text syncTime="3366.461" offset="13572107">--I believe it's Commissioner against Ackerly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.729" offset="13581198">It's cited in one of the amicus briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.300" offset="13599483">Second, the concession that you just heard a moment ago, that the statute would not apply as the government says it should apply if this was deemed to be a criminal penalty, we submit under this Court's reasoning in Clark v. Martinez, it just gave away the store in the government's case, because if it is possible -- if the government has now admitted it's possible -- and I don't want to get into all of the permutations of Hudson -- but if it is possible that the label of civil penalty does not -- is not dispositive as to whether a penalty is civil or criminal, then, as the Court held in Clark v. Martinez, the lowest common denominator applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.900" offset="13801880">One has to interpret this statute so that it is applicable across the range of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.820" offset="13829570">And if that's so, then it follows, it runs from accrual as that word is commonly understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.159" offset="13858931">Next point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.859" offset="13865723">The Government said that there are no cases where the Court considered the claim that it is making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.717" offset="13905116">We would point the Court's attention to the Rotella case, in which in the context of a private plaintiff who did not have the resources of the government, the argument was made that the RICO statute should have a discovery of the violation type principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.797" offset="13993410">And the argument was made there that RICO can encompass a pattern of fraudulent acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.217" offset="14023085">And the plaintiff in that case said, as the government says here, fraud can be concealed, can be complex, can be difficult to discover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.275" offset="14067389">And the Court unanimously had a response to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.710" offset="14081077">The response was that, at least as soon as you know the injury, where there is an injury element, the difficulty of discovery of the actual violation doesn't defer the running of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.422" offset="14147950">It would defeat the purposes of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.458" offset="14160071">The Government also argued that the problems of privilege are not significant ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.694" offset="14185044">We would point the Court's attention to the Joint Appendix in the Second Circuit, where the Government asserted privilege with respect to our questions about its investigations of the counterparty to this alleged quid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.906" offset="14253903">The Court also asked a question of whether there are any cases in which courts have dealt with government agencies being diligent, and the claim being the government agency was not diligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.583" offset="14312626">The Court has dealt with that in a related context, in the Heckler v. Cheney context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.402" offset="14335823">And in the Heckler v. Cheney context the Court held that that type of issue, how an administrative agency treats facts that are -- that it discovers and whether it chooses to bring a claim or not, whether it chooses to believe that they are in violation of a statute, the agency is charged with administering is not fit for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.435" offset="14427983">No different result should apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.554" offset="14436447">Just two more points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.104" offset="14446687">The False Claims Act has a -- which has an explicit discovery rule, also has a statute of repose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.010" offset="14478242">It would be very odd, indeed, if the one circumstance where Congress, one of the few circumstances where Congress chose to use the word “ discovery ”, was where the government was injured, and Congress chose to impose a statute of repose, where, as they say in the 100 or other statutes that use language, fraud-like language, Congress intended there to be discovery and no repose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.143" offset="14582837">And that really ties into the last point, which is that there are by our count if you look at fraud, misleading, false statement-type statutes, there are somewhere like 80 or 100-type statutes that use that kind of language that would be applicable if this Court affirms the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.008" offset="14674265">This case was in -- the government says this case was an outlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.496" offset="14696208">There is no reason to believe this case will remain an outlier.</text>
