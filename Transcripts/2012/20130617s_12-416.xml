            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="8.064" offset="139703">This is a pretty complex antitrust patent case and it's about what's called the reverse payment settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.566" offset="181708">A drug company that has government approval to sell its drug called AndroGel sues for patent infringement generic drug makers who want government approval to sell their chemically similar drugs in competition with AndroGel.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.033" offset="251611">The company is all settled and the terms in effect the generics pharmacies will stay out of the market for a certain period of time and the patent owner, AndroGel's maker in return pays them many millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.191" offset="320261">The Federal Trade Commission sued the settling party claiming that this reverse payment, it's called a reverse payment because normally, if you sue an infringer, you would expect maybe the infringer would pay something to the guy who's suing you, but this versus the other way, it's the patent holder, you can skip that.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.075" offset="395807">In any case, the Federal Trade Commission sued the settling parties claiming that this reverse payment settlement agreement violates the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.023" offset="439589">Now, the Court of Appeals held that the settlement agreement couldn't violate the antitrust laws because it falls within the scope of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.591" offset="469786">That is the patent allowed the maker of the drug to monopolize the market anyway and the settlement agreement didn't really do anymore than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.052" offset="511687">Now, we do not agree with the circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.145" offset="524016">We find that the party's contested behavior does not fall within the scope of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.881" offset="547004">A valid patent of course would've permitted the patent holder to keep everybody else namely the generics out of the market, but an invalid patent would have not permitted the patent holder to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.641" offset="597995">And here, the validity of the patent is not -- made -- is being challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.606" offset="613878">You don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.274" offset="616594">It could be the one, it could be the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.025" offset="627566">So, as our precedent suggests in order to analyze this case correctly we have to go beyond the statement it's within the scope of the patent and we have to look at the competing aims of patent law and antitrust law and determine here which predominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.695" offset="698201">Doing that, we first conclude that the reverse payments settlements at least sometimes pose a risk of adverse effects on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.770" offset="738534">They threaten to allow patent holders and potential competitors to split and thereby maintain super competitive patent related profits even where the patent would end up being held invalid or would it be infringed or the generic to enter the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.411" offset="809064">Suppose, for example, the patent has ten years to run and earns its holder $50 million dollars per year of extra profits because the patent gives that holder an exclusive right to make him sell the drug, a finding of invalidity or entry by a generic might reduce that 500 million, maybe all the way to zero, but a settlement agreement removes that threat in return for a payment of say $100 million, keeps out of the marketplace for that hundred million, the patent challenging generic and the consumer pays more than if the generic have not received the $100 million payment and had consequently continued it's efforts to enter or maybe it's settled in other ways and it ended up by entering thereby producing a more competitive marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.493" offset="1001430">Second and on the other hand, we concede that a reverse payment of this type may sometimes prove justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.614" offset="1033927">Suppose it simply reflects savings in litigation costs or the fair value paid for other services that the generic promises to perform, but then there are other times the reverse payment may serve no such purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.721" offset="1090351">It may simply lead the generic to agree it will not enter the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.829" offset="1106756">Delayed market entry considered in and off itself alone is an antitrust law and typically, not justified or it could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.966" offset="1147298">Third, the patent holder might have power perhaps conferred by the patent itself to charge prices above the competitive level, so the agreement could have a significant anticompetitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.328" offset="1196826">Fourth, the Court should be able to administer this kind of antitrust case normally without too much difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.137" offset="1232039">Suppose the payment is large and it serves no legitimate purpose, at that point a Court may well be able to assume without getting into the complex business of trying to relitigate the patent's validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.606" offset="1285851">It may simply assume because it has no reason to think the contrary that the patentee is worried about the strength of the patent, maybe it's too weak, and though he is seeking to split and thereby to maintain the super competitive profits in order to avoid that new competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.150" offset="1352098">And finally, the patent -- the parties, of course, remain free to settle their patent litigation in other ways that do not pose similar risks of significant unjustified anticompetitive harm, say, by agreeing that the generic can just enter earlier, then it otherwise would seem to be able to enter under the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.694" offset="1430256">So, we consequently conclude that the Eleventh Circuit's near automatic rule of antitrust immunity is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.802" offset="1462648">We also reject the FTC's claim that reverse payment settlements are near automatically unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.581" offset="1489816">Rather we conclude that the FTC should apply a rule of reason as we describe it and it may proceed with the case on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.215" offset="1524297">We discuss these matters further in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.698" offset="1538299">The Chief Justice has filed the dissenting opinion in which he is joined by Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.253" offset="1564526">Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
