            <text syncTime="1777.404" offset="7215980">And moreover, they decided something separate, which is at JA-305 they said something different, which is the kind of threshold defect in the takings claim turning on raisins, which is there is a capacity problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.211" offset="7263210">So there are two problems with the raisin claims, a capacity problem and a just compensation problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.444" offset="7284108">The capacity problem is this: In 2002, after having been strictly raisin producers since 1969, entering into a market where there was a reserve requirement from the beginning, they knew what they were getting into, they decided to adopt a new business model, as Petitioner's counsel says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.482" offset="7352235">But, as was found below, they adopted a business model that was an intentional, willful attempt to evade regulatory requirements in order to secure an unfair competitive advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.463" offset="7396225">But what they did was they took on the obligations of a handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.558" offset="7412526">They became raisin handlers in 2002.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.742" offset="7421303">And what came with that status were a series of regulatory obligations that apply only to handlers and under the AMAA can apply only to handlers: The requirement to have raisins inspected, the requirement to file truthful reports, the requirement to make records available, and the requirement to separate out raisins into what's called free tonnage and reserve tonnage, any raisins processed, it doesn't matter who owns them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.420" offset="7524016">Those are handler-specific regulatory obligations that were imposed upon them, and they violated every single one of them willfully and intentionally in order to secure an unfair competitive advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.367" offset="7563827">And what the USDA did was impose penalties on them for the violation of law that attached to them only as raisin handlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.116" offset="7602801">And then they invoked the judicial review proceedings in Section 14 that provides a judicial review mechanism only for handlers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.537" offset="8652506">One was that it thought that in a statute like that, that simply allocated benefits and burdens among private entities, Congress would not have intended there to be compensation available in the event that there were a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.280" offset="8703497">And that was actually the Government's position in that case and the Apfel plurality cited to that portion of the Government's brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2171.301" offset="8791582">And we think that the dollar-for-dollar aspect of that was important to the plurality's analysis because it viewed that as evidence that Congress would not have intended the Tucker Act to be deployed, because it would have been a pointless exercise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.367" offset="13835827">I'd like to make two quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.413" offset="13847948">One is that I believe that the Government has essentially conceded here in this argument and in their brief that the Tucker Act does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.595" offset="13888699">They have told us that the Tucker Act does not apply on page 50 and repeated here when Congress could not have contemplated a compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.934" offset="13926106">Now, in addition -- and their only answer to that is to say, first, that Congress didn't think it would be a taking, which in Regional Rail, this Court said is not the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.757" offset="13973335">And secondly, that if -- if there's one -- we should get paid once, compensation once and then the administrator's going to cancel the program, which is no answer at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.520" offset="14016385">Either the statute contemplates compensation for everybody or it contemplates it for nobody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.299" offset="14039582">I think they have effectively conceded that the Tucker Act does not apply.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael W. McConnell</label>
            <text syncTime="3496.388" offset="14091931">--And the second issue I wanted to talk about so is this capacity issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.059" offset="14102589">Certainly, we have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.649" offset="14112934">When -- it's not third-party standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.617" offset="14124846">All of the money comes out of our pocket, yes, we have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.304" offset="14143549">And secondly, we certainly -- and then that is in our capacity as handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.805" offset="14161521">Essentially, the Department of Agriculture's view is that during those couple of days when the raisins are going through our packing plant, that we acquired them and possessed them during those couple of days and that we should have given them their -- their share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.155" offset="14218991">That's raisins, that's not money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.218" offset="14227246">But by the time they get around to enforcing that and so forth, the raisins are gone and now the money stands in -- stands in for the raisins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.822" offset="14265593">But that is a taking claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.929" offset="14278028">We think it's a -- it's a straightforward taking claim under -- under Norwood and Missouri Pacific Railroad, that's a merits question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.239" offset="14303314">But in any event, it is not a problem of capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.550" offset="14316584">Whatever might be, that taking, that taking is in the capacity as a handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.811" offset="14337587">Those are my two points.</text>
