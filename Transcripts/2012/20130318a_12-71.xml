            <text syncTime="20.913" offset="190426">First, prohibiting a State from effectively enforcing the citizenship requirement is so far-reaching that if Congress had intended that, it would have put the prohibition in the statute expressly, which it did not do.</text>

            <text syncTime="42.427" offset="276525">Second, when Congress wanted to expressly prohibit something, it knew how to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.147" offset="299409">It expressly prohibited notarization and other forms of authentication.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.635" offset="321352">This Court has frequently held that statutory language that indicates -- that prohibits one thing indicates there's no other implicit prohibition: The expressio unius rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.112" offset="703262">Why would you think that Congress, in doing the short form registration, didn't consider the issue of fraud, and decide that it had arrived at the balance it wanted?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Horne</label>
            <text syncTime="161.504" offset="752790">Because, Your Honor, the -- the Congress did not specify what the States could or could not do.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.978" offset="798661">And it was to be an attestation, a signed attestation subject to -- to the penalty of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.418" offset="836486">So it's not as though the Federal form didn't relate to citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.321" offset="860101">It did.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.923" offset="862504">And it said this is the way we deal with citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.939" offset="870550">Then Arizona adds something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.391" offset="884343">So I would like, General Horne, for you to respond to a question that's already been raised in -- by the -- the panel that decided this case originally, which was, the statute said -- says each State must accept and use the Federal form, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.157" offset="979428">That's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.109" offset="983190">And then it says, in addition to that, the State can do other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.346" offset="1008163">The judge who asked that question thought it was perfectly clear, you use the Federal form, and if you want to do something in addition -- but you must use and accept the Federal Form and not add something to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.889" offset="1074305">I think it's very clear that this statute does not say the signature is the only thing that the States can use to verify the eligibility of the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.830" offset="1114116">Now, in -- in using the term “ accept and use ”, Your Honor, accept and use in ordinary language -- we've given lots of examples in our briefs -- one can accept and use a form for a particular purpose without that form being sufficient to accomplish that purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.772" offset="6489907">And the trial court, the district court, had a lot of findings justifying the statement that the burdens are minimal, including the fact, for example, that if all the rejected forms had been accepted, the increase in Hispanic registration would have only have been.1 percent, which is statistically insignificant, including the fact that out of a population of $6 million, the plaintiffs, who have all the resources one can imagine if you look at the list of plaintiffs, could only find one person out of six million people that could not satisfy -- who was entitled to vote, who could not satisfy the requirements of the Act; and a lot of other findings by the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.120" offset="12299226">The National Voter Registration Act aims to streamline the process of registration for applicants, and the provisions that provide for the establishment of a Federal form embody that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.476" offset="12340708">And I'd like to point to three features of the relevant statutory language that I think support our reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.380" offset="12364323">And the particular critical provision is at page 22A of the appendix to the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.217" offset="12391699">And I'm sorry, I know that the provisions are located in a number of areas, but the gray brief at page 22A has the critical provision in our view, which is one that Ms. Millett was pointing to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.126" offset="12443317">Now, what this provision embodies is this understanding: That the EAC is the one who determines what the content of the Federal form is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.649" offset="12481352">Not the States, but the EAC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.851" offset="12490233">The States do have a role in this scheme, and I think it's important to understand what that role is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3724.093" offset="15003108">They admit that we can reject applications by reference to other -- by reference to other documentation but they try to draw a distinction between that and asking the person to write down the driver's license number.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.287" offset="15067892">But there is nothing in the statute that justifies that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.406" offset="15080431">A reference to criminal history has nothing to do with whether or not there is a distinction with respect to citizenship between looking at other documents and asking the person for their driver's license numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.797" offset="15129959">In both cases it's something outside of the form and they have admitted we can go outside the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.951" offset="15150543">With respect to legislative history, Your Honor, I think the key thing -- Mr. Justice Breyer, in your question was, it's only in one place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.824" offset="15190041">There are a lot of other places that go the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.759" offset="15201848">So we cannot conclude from that one place what the majority of Congress expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.663" offset="15221387">With respect to HAVA, in HAVA, the Congress had another opportunity to expressly state that the State could not look to external evidence and ask for additional evidence, and they chose not to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.153" offset="15271438">And so I would say that HAVA is further evidence that Congress was not choosing to prohibit us from asking for additional information to fulfill our function, if it's necessary, of being sure that the applicant is eligible to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.580" offset="15329116">With respect to the Siebold case, the court in Siebold specifically said there will be no preemption unless there is a direct conflict and only to the extent of that conflict, and in that connection -- one last sentence, Your Honor -- if there are two plausible interpretations, ordinary principles of Federalism say one should not choose the interpretation that results in preemption, and the same thing applies with respect to the canon of constitutional accordance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.130" offset="15435278">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
