            <text syncTime="21.663" offset="194124">Myriad unlocked the secrets of two human genes.</text>

            <text syncTime="43.677" offset="282209">Now, Myriad deserves credit for having unlocked these secrets.</text>

            <text syncTime="76.833" offset="414806">And this Court has said repeatedly that just extracting a natural product is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.135" offset="431943">For example, this Court has used the example of gold.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.320" offset="444691">You can't patent gold because it's a natural product.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.856" offset="454826">The examples that you cite all involve further manipulation of a product of nature, so that the product of nature is no longer what it was in nature; it's become something different, and in many instances has taken on a new function.</text>

            <text syncTime="1906.789" offset="7734630">And what the Court said is that -- as Justice Kennedy alluded to earlier, that the Court's not in a position to resolve that dispute conclusively.</text>

            <text syncTime="2929.988" offset="11827391">I had thought -- and you can -- I'd be interested in your view -- that the patent law is filled with uneasy compromises, because on the one hand, we do want people to invent; on the other hand, we're very worried about them tying up some kind of whatever it is, particularly a thing that itself could be used for further advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.271" offset="11916521">And so that the compromise that has been built historically into this area is: Of course, if you get a new satisfying process to extract the sap from the plant in the Amazon, patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.161" offset="11968139">Of course, if you get the sap out and you find that you can use it, you manipulate it, you use it, you figure out a way to use it to treat cancer, wonderful, patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.386" offset="12021011">But what you can't patent is the sap itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.723" offset="12042326">Now, in any individual case that might be unfortunate or fortunate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.210" offset="12064269">But consider it in the mine run of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.396" offset="12077017">It's important to keep products of nature free of the restrictions that patents there are, so when Captain Ferno goes to the Amazon and discovers 50 new types of plants, saps and medicines, discovers them, although that expedition was expensive, although nobody had found it before, he can't get a patent on the thing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.046" offset="12179626">He gets a patent on the process, on the use of the thing, but not the thing itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.293" offset="12264576">First of all, in this Court's decision in Brenner v.

            <text syncTime="3054.802" offset="12326643">What you do have to do is have utility for the invention itself described in the specification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.908" offset="12355064">And that's what the Patent Office looked to in its Utility Guidelines in 2001.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.944" offset="12375231">But ultimately, neither -- I think this case is very -- very easily decided on a straightforward ground that does not require the Court to go making fine distinctions between cDNA and DNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.204" offset="12428312">And that ground is this: The reasoned Utility Guidelines issued in 2001 by the Patent Office, who has not, in a very significant decision, joined the brief of the Solicitor General in this case -- and which they continue to apply under Section 2107 of the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure, these guidelines not only tell examiners what to do, but in the Federal Register they had notice and comment and 23 specific reasoned, supported by case law, supported by science, responses to the objectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.245" offset="12580449">Almost every objection that is made to our patents here was made there and answered there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3735.664" offset="15050065">And drugs are often made by taking one molecule and another molecule, both of which are known, reacting them in a test tube, which is a very common thing, reactions have been around 100 years just like snipping has been, but they make something new and useful and life saving from that.</text>
