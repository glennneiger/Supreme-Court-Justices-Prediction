            <text syncTime="11.891" offset="152746">There are three primary points I would like to focus on this morning during my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.443" offset="174898">First, the question presented by Mr. Henderson involves a very small subset of cases which are -- which come before the Court under Rule 55 -- 52(b) each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.417" offset="222859">These are the cases that were referred to as the special case in the Olano decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.321" offset="246473">They have errors which, at the time of trial, were unsettled or unclear; but, by the time they made it to the appellate court, they had become clear by a clarifying rule or a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.414" offset="302793">Second--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="50.599" offset="307495">What -- what about the time they come up here?</text>
            <text syncTime="54.135" offset="321706">52(b) applies to every court, does it not?</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="58.003" offset="337170">So suppose there's been -- been no objection to a uncertain question of -- on an uncertain question of law until the case gets here.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.929" offset="396834">Can -- can counsel argue that this Court should nonetheless review the case because, if we agree with counsel, thereupon, the law would be clear?</text>
            <text syncTime="85.337" offset="446467">When we issued our decision, the law would be clear.</text>

            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Gilley</label>
            <text syncTime="88.558" offset="459423">I believe that the Court would have the authority to do that because it says if it is on direct appeal or not yet final.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.997" offset="497144">So it would not yet be final unless the time had expired for the petitioner to get to the Supreme Court.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="105.583" offset="527446">I -- I wonder how we would go about deciding whether we would take such a case or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.256" offset="554196">We'd take all -- all those cases where counsel says, I didn't -- we didn't raise any of these objections, neither in the court of appeals nor in the district court; but, if you agree -- if you agree with me, Your Honors, that the law is thus and so, once you say that, that will make the decisions below clear error, and, therefore, you should be able to reverse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.520" offset="647192">Makes sense, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patricia_gilley" startTime="137.455" stopTime="151.631">
            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Gilley</label>
            <text syncTime="137.455" offset="654924">Well, I believe the Supreme Court has, under its own special rules, the -- the ability to take an argument in -- a petition that has not been raised before, but on its own could accept it if it is clear at the time--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="151.631" stopTime="173.045">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="151.631" offset="711662">But then what your -- your first answer was that this is a very small set of cases that you're dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.416" offset="734859">If your answer to Justice Scalia is yes, this Court could take a case that's unsettled and, by settling it, make the error plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.724" offset="776027">That would open the door to a huge number of cases, wouldn't it?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="173.045" offset="797343">--I don't believe so, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.145" offset="805703">I believe that the provisions to get to the Supreme Court -- frankly, I don't know the answer as to if you had skipped the -- the appellate court, and -- and we're still in that window of time, that transition period after the appellate court had ruled, and only then the clarifying error came, I think you could still come to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.945" offset="900893">But the very narrow -- the very narrow--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="201.578" offset="911446">Well, it would be narrow in the sense that substantial rights would have to be affected and the other conditions of Olano on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.670" offset="947809">But I think, consequent on Justice Scalia's question is, that itself would be another issue in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.026" offset="989291">Is this one of those cases: Number one, it was wrong; number two, it's new; number three, is it clear under all the Olano criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.397" offset="1026699">And that would have to be decided in every case.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="233.983" offset="1041118">So at the end of the day, it could be a small subset of cases, but the number that would be presented, both to this Court and the court of appeals, would be quite substantial.</text>

            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Gilley</label>
            <text syncTime="244.974" offset="1085004">--Well, I think there would be very few that would come directly to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.759" offset="1100155">The vast majority of the cases obviously would come through the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.247" offset="1114156">And what I was referring to as a very small subset would be those cases where there is actually an unsettled error -- an unsettled claimed error at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.388" offset="1162744">There are very few cases that would come out of the Supreme Court during the period of time of appeal that would allow for the petitioner to -- to say, well, now it's clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.728" offset="1312060">I think that my -- this case, Mr. Henderson's case, is unusually long.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.132" offset="1329719">In fact, it was a year between the time he was sentenced in June of 2010 until June of 2011, when Tapia was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.939" offset="1372873">So he was actually waiting between the period of the trial stage to -- into the Fifth Circuit for over a year before Tapia was even decided, and then several months after that before the Fifth Circuit ruled on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.782" offset="1440269">So this is an unusually long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.484" offset="1455107">I don't think that that's common.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.786" offset="1464302">I think the vast majority of the cases do not come within that transitional period.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.590" offset="1483528">As -- as the Fifth Circuit noticed after Mr. Henderson's case in Escalante-Reyes, they sua sponte had their own -- they called for an en banc in Escalante-Reyes and changed the position that they had in Mr. Henderson's case.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.420" offset="1566806">Suppose that it was proposed to amend Rule 52(b) to take out the word “ plain ”, so that the rule would read simply,</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.213" offset="7990003">The purpose of that prong is to isolate out one set of errors, obvious errors, from all of the other trial errors that happen every day that are not correctable under Rule 52, debatable errors that even reasonably experienced district court judges and prosecutors might have overlooked in the hustle and bustle of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.222" offset="8054055">That second prong is designed to say, “ We want ”, as the Court said in Frady,</text>

            <text syncTime="2085.219" offset="8445996">Well, what about the -- I mean, that's the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.136" offset="8453729">The word “ plain ” of course refers by and large to an error that the lower court judge should have caught, so you should have objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.694" offset="8495943">But why limit it exclusively to that; that is, you have -- you know, they quote the Schooner, Peggy and Chief Justice Marshall and back to the history of Hammurabi, as far as we know, that sometimes there is a case where just simple fairness, plus the fact that the law is now plain, means that the appellate court should treat this person the same as a thousand others who now will be treated according to the new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.713" offset="8612031">And indeed, you're complicating it even further for the reason that I really meant my question to be aimed at you, you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.367" offset="8638571">I mean, in fact, the reason that I said that you're going to create distinctions, there will be a case, the fellow is going to go to jail for 50 extra years, the law is plain that he shouldn't, that didn't come about until the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.578" offset="8707430">And here we have six identical people in the circuit where the law was clear one way and they get the new rule's advantage, and six identical people in another circuit where the law was clear the other way and they get the advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.719" offset="8759988">But in the one circuit where the law wasn't clear, he doesn't get the advantage of the new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.873" offset="8780677">Now, that seems pretty unfair, and I could at least make up some cases where it's just a horror.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.210" offset="8805964">And if that's so, why don't we leave plain with enough wiggle room so that where it's fair, the judge on the Court of Appeals can say, it is now plain and the other things are satisfied so we apply it to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.953" offset="8860925">That's the whole long question that I've got every part of it in there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.129" offset="8921634">But it is balanced against a very important systemic interest in judicial efficiency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2211.819" offset="8952459">But, Mr. Wall, your whole argument about judicial efficiency is an incentives argument, and it depends upon the notion that a lawyer is going to change their behavior, a lawyer is going to make an objection that he otherwise wouldn't have made if the rule that Ms. Gilley proposes is accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.179" offset="9021840">And this goes back to what Justice Breyer said earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.565" offset="9035423">I don't know of a lawyer who would say the following to himself: I'm not going to make this objection because I'm just going to assume that sometime between now and my direct appeal the law is going to change, and it's going to change in my favor, and when it changes, I'm going to be able to make this objection and get over not only prong two but prong three and four of the test, and life will be grand for my client.</text>

            <text syncTime="2264.954" offset="9164991">Even if I granted that the incentives of defendants would be entirely unchanged no matter what rule this Court adopted, and I don't grant that for all the reasons in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.440" offset="9198950">But even if I thought that were right, every time a Court of Appeals or this Court issued an intervening decision of criminal law or criminal procedure, a set of defendants who had not raised a claim of that error at trial would come in to the Court of Appeals or this Court with a claim of plain error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.652" offset="9259763">And what we would see is a significant shift of judicial resources to plain-error cases, to do fact-intensive third and fourth prong review to consider a set of errors that were never meant to be put on the table under Rule 52(b).</text>
