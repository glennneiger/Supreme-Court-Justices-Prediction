            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Ginsburg has our opinion this morning in case 12-52, Dan's City Used Cars versus Pelkey.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="10.034" stopTime="331.632">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.034" offset="146620">This case concerns the preemptive scope of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994, its acronym F4A, an Act about motor carriers, not airplanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.740" offset="217360">The F4A bar state laws related to a price, route or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.380" offset="267933">The question presented is whether that provision precludes state law claims stemming from the storage and disposal of towed vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.374" offset="315894">We hold it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.006" offset="326447">Respondent Robert Pelkey owned a Honda Civic which he parked in the lot of his apartment complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.179" offset="363123">Tenants were required to remove their cars in the event of a snowstorm so the snow could be cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.510" offset="396455">When it snowed heavily in February 2007 and Pelkey failed to remove his car, his landlord engaged Dan's City Used Cars to tow and store the Honda.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.518" offset="456537">At the time and unknown to Dan's City, Pelkey was suffering from a grave medical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.328" offset="483704">Soon, thereafter, he had surgery, suffered a heart attack, and remained hospitalized for two months.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.657" offset="513066">New Hampshire's Abandoned Motor Vehicle Law allows storage companies to dispose of unclaimed cars if efforts to locate and notify the owner fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.028" offset="566565">Relying on that law, Dan's City set an auction date of Pelkey's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.169" offset="591120">Pelkey learned of the upcoming auction upon his discharge from the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.822" offset="613689">Two days, prior to the schedule of auction, Pelkey's attorney notified Dan's City that Pelkey wished to reclaim the car and would pay charges due for towing and storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.537" offset="668547">Dan's City nevertheless proceeded on its disposal course.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.682" offset="689131">Attracting no bidders at the auction, Dan's City traded the car away.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.377" offset="711910">Receiving no proceeds from the sale, Pelkey sued Dan's City in New Hampshire state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.965" offset="746287">He alleged that in selling his Honda, Dan's City failed to meet requirements of New Hampshire's Abandoned Vehicle Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.632" offset="780978">Consequently, Pelkey sought damages under New Hampshire's Consumer Protection Act and common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.265" offset="811489">The trial court granted summary judgment to Dan's City holding that Pelkey's claims were preempted by the F4A, but the New Hampshire Supreme Court reversed that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.856" offset="861853">The F4A does not preempt Pelkey's suit, the higher court held, because his claims did not relate to the transportation of property or to a motor carrier's service.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.569" offset="920680">We affirm the judgment of the New Hampshire Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.637" offset="936981">The F4A, as I said a moment ago, preempts state laws related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.227" offset="995391">Pelkey's claims are not preempted because they do not concern the transportation of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.604" offset="1024857">He seeks redress for Dan's City's disposal of his vehicle after transportation by towing had ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.932" offset="1062160">Pelkey raises no objection to the manner in which his car was moved, nor does he question the price of the tow.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.507" offset="1092462">He seeks compensation only for what happened once the car ceased moving and was stored.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.957" offset="1130287">Furthermore, Pelkey's claims are unrelated to the service a motor carrier offers its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.237" offset="1155365">The transportation service, Dan's City provided, was the removal of Pelkey's car from his landlord's parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.936" offset="1190160">That service, which did involve the movement of property, ended months before the conduct of which Pelkey complains.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.064" offset="1230702">We note the one-way street on which Dan's City seeks to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.806" offset="1249719">The towing company relies on New Hampshire's Abandoned Vehicle Law to justify selling the Honda, yet it would stop Pelkey from invoking that very same law to demand Dan's City's compliance with owner protective provisions of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.495" offset="1324429">We note finally that via the F4A, Congress sought to prevent states from impeding the free flow of trade and transportation in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.620" offset="1368942">State law claims concerning the disposal of stored vehicles are a long distance from Congress' driving concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.623" offset="1408961">This Court's decision affirming the New Hampshire Supreme Court's judgment is unanimous.</text>
