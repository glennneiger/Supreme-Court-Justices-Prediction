            <text syncTime="12.391" offset="156987">The state action doctrine provides a defense to a Federal antitrust suit when a state has clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed an intent to displace competition with respect to the particular activity at issue in the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.115" offset="211844">Now, in practical terms, what that comes down to is whether application of Federal competition law would somehow subvert a sovereign state policy choice that's clearly evident in state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.273" offset="256461">Now, that policy might be expressed in mandatory or compulsory terms, but, short of that, it would also be enough, if the -- the state had specifically permitted conduct that is inherently anticompetitive.</text>

            <text syncTime="55.901" offset="330963">You don't think that the grant of powers in this case would permit the hospital authorities, the corporation, to set prices for their services that are below the competitive prices in order to serve the needy?</text>

            <text syncTime="77.500" offset="417376">--I think it is, although for reasons that don't affect the analysis of the question about an anticompetitive acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.087" offset="447782">And let me explain why the analysis might be different with respect to prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.974" offset="463351">There is specific authorization in the statute for the hospital authorities, in conjunction with the counties, to partly fund -- or, I guess, entirely, in principle -- fund their services through tax revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.116" offset="515910">So they have another source of funding that would allow them to price in ways that a competitive actor would not necessarily price its services.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.721" offset="550287">So if we're talking about particular pricing decisions -- say -- I guess it would be below cost pricing that is alleged to somehow be anticompetitive -- then there might very well be a state action defense to that because it -- because the state -- the power to price services subsidized in a way that an ordinary actor wouldn't be able to do--</text>

            <text syncTime="146.110" offset="691870">I think -- I think the best example comes from Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.131" offset="715903">So in that case, the issue was a challenge to a practice of minimum fee schedules that were set by -- not by the state, but agreed upon by a bar organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.558" offset="769611">Now, the state in that case of course regulated the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.343" offset="784762">It regulated admission into the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.212" offset="796256">It regulated certain aspects of the conduct of the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.830" offset="814750">And this Court held in Bates v. Arizona State Bar that those sort of regulations do constitute state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.852" offset="846829">But the Court did not accept the submission that the state action defense covered the setting of minimum prices that was at issue in that case, because that was not something that there was state action over.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.279" offset="904507">And as a -- and taking a step back, the justification for the state action doctrine is that the state is trying to pursue some policy that is part of its traditional sovereign prerogatives to regulate its own economy, and that Federal law was not understood to intrude upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.991" offset="975351">But if the state is not actually trying to advance some other policy with respect to the particular conduct at issue, then it can't be said that the state has done something that Federal law should stand aside for.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="230.650" offset="1029999">Mr. Horwich, you said in -- in your reply brief that if the Hospital Authorities Law specifically authorized local hospital authorities to acquire any and all hospitals within their geographic area, then the clear articulation requirement would be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.264" offset="1116412">But the Authorities Law does authorize the acquisition of other hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.888" offset="1158940">And it doesn't say one or two; it says other facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.458" offset="1185271">So why doesn't the hospital laws law do exactly what you said would satisfy the clear articulation requirement?</text>

            <text syncTime="281.933" offset="1235113">--Well, I think the key difference there, Justice Ginsburg, between the hypothetical we offered in the reply brief and the statute here is that the -- the additional words “ any and all ” make it clear that the state is contemplating that there could -- the county might opt for socializing its hospital services, putting all of them under the control of the hospital authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.399" offset="1329049">And by contrast, what we have here is an ordinary corporate power to acquire property.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.468" offset="1353291">And like all of the ordinary corporate powers that the authority possesses that are -- that resemble those that an ordinary business corporation would have, the most natural understanding of them is that the state expects them to be exercised in conformity with the background principles that bind everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.264" offset="1428419">So--</text>

            <text syncTime="330.616" offset="1429882">Just so I understand your answer to Justice Ginsburg, you're saying there would be a difference if the charter said the authority may require -- acquire any properties to fulfill its mission, and if it said the authority may acquire properties to promote its mission?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="357.081" offset="1535730">So you think a general saying they may acquire properties doesn't implicitly say they may acquire all properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.337" offset="1560703">That seems a pretty thin--</text>

            <text syncTime="366.639" offset="1573973">Well -- but I think, in this area, it's -- it's important, for a couple reasons, that we actually have -- have some substantial assurance of what the state is trying to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.228" offset="1616292">And a power to grant proper -- excuse me -- a power to acquire properties, generally speaking, unadorned with any particular expression from the state about how -- how that power is to be used, is something that can be used competitively or anticompetitively, and you can't infer from that that the state really has an objective of, as I say, such as socializing its hospital services because -- and -- and that clarity of expression from the state is really important here, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.949" offset="1739172">First of all, this is an odd rule to begin with, in that it allows state law to displace Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.072" offset="2391710">Let me give you an example from this Court's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.107" offset="2403831">Southern Motor Carriers involved the submission of -- by motor carriers of their rates to a public service commission that was -- that would accept them as filed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.196" offset="2440194">Now, the states -- some of the states there said, well, you can file them individually, or you can file them jointly, and we don't necessarily have a preference one way or the other for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.718" offset="2478228">But the fact that the states had said you can file them jointly, which is a horizontal agreement among competitors and sure looked anticompetitive, the fact that the state had said that and put that option on the table qualified as a clear articulation from the state that it intended the displacement of competition to occur if that specific option was chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.549" offset="2557640">The difference here is that if you are willing to say in a case like what we have here with a statute that confers a -- a power that is entirely neutral as to how it would be -- how it could be exercised, you have the problem of not really knowing what the state would intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.511" offset="2625454">And so you can't say that the state clearly intended that there be displacement of competition--</text>

            <text syncTime="651.174" offset="2712076">Now, as I read that, it certainly includes the rather specific power of acquiring a hospital.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.815" offset="8614705">I mean the Federal Trade Commission guidelines for market concentration is anything up to four, four or fewer participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.271" offset="8644484">The notion that the legislature in 1941 was providing the express authority to acquire multiple hospitals in a single municipality or county was focused only on huge metropolises, of which there was only one, or on counties that were so small that they couldn't otherwise even attempt to support more than one hospital is just fanciful; it's made up.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.562" offset="13725614">Where can you locate this intent to displace competition in the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.331" offset="13736690">And I would like to just run through, if I could, each of his answers and why I think they are insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.401" offset="13752990">So the first one, of course, we've talked a lot about the existence of general corporate powers, but the most natural inference there is that the State expects those to be exercised in conformity with the background principles that anybody else who has general powers has.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.459" offset="13805235">Now, the idea that the authority has a mandate, a purpose it's supposed to serve, of course that's always true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.629" offset="13833970">States always have some purpose in mind when they set up some sub-State entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.617" offset="13849852">The question isn't whether there is particular ends the State is trying to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.302" offset="13864586">The question here is whether the State intended to pursue those ends through the particular means of displacing competition, here, displacing competition in the market for paid health care services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.026" offset="13907531">And Mr. Waxman also pointed to the rate of return provision in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.680" offset="13930101">Now as a sort of a threshold matter, there's -- if past is prologue, there is not any reason to think that that will be not be rigorously enforced with respect to the privately controlled operations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.452" offset="13969180">But -- and that's sort of the second question presented, and we can set that aside for the moment, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.904" offset="13987048">But it seems to me there are two far more natural explanations for the presence of the rate of return provision in the statute than the one Mr. Waxman would like you to -- to give to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.546" offset="14029575">The first explanation is: This is a statute about providing public care for indigents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.533" offset="14053503">Nobody should be making a profit off of that and the State wants to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.103" offset="14071789">And that seems to be a very natural explanation that doesn't depend at all on the State intending to displace competition completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.857" offset="14102822">The -- the rate -- the price regulation provision also can be naturally understood as a response to the recognition that there will be some de facto monopolies in the situation where there is only one hospital in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.052" offset="14171577">But it does not mean that the state wants there to be more monopolies so that it can bring in the unfortunate medicine of rate regulation to respond to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.075" offset="14207730">Presumably, the state intends, as is the accepted background principle of free market competition in this country, that there won't be monopolies unless they -- unless they arise of necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.604" offset="14293830">You have lots of evidence that the authority does very little oversight of these hospitals when they move forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.610" offset="14325803">But is that the issue before us?</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.312" offset="14340641">Is the question of immunity as to what happens in the operation of the hospital, or in their merger and acquisition, their actual formation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.937" offset="14379198">And -- so that to the extent that we were to conclude that the state has delegated immunity on the basis of merger?</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.459" offset="14417232">Why do we need to look any further at whether there has or has not been an appropriate degree of supervision of that decision?</text>

            <text syncTime="3588.350" offset="14460804">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.767" offset="14462476">Well, the -- the -- I -- I don't think the two are entirely -- are entirely separable as a matter of competition law, because the reason the competition law is concerned with mergers is not because of the transaction as such, but it's because of what it does going forward to the structure of the market and the competitive behavior of those in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.693" offset="14530186">And so the State Action Doctrine says that the state -- if the state's going to go create monopoly, it needs to take ownership of that monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.048" offset="14563622">And I'm using ownership not in the literally sense, but at least ownership in the sense of actively supervising the monopoly to be sure that it is pursuing the -- the objective that the state has in mind for creating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.356" offset="14608866">So that's -- that's why we are still concerned there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.558" offset="14617643">Mr. Waxman referred to the Certificate of Need Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.944" offset="14631227">I think there is a very close analogy to be drawn to Goldfarb here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.879" offset="14642930">That is the -- the question of minimum fee schedules agreed to by lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.931" offset="14659126">The state of -- the state of Virginia regulated entry into the market for the practice of law just as the certificate of need regulates entry into the hospital market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.806" offset="14698623">But horizontal agreements among people already in the market, such as here and such as the minimum fee schedule in Goldfarb, are not exempt just because of it.</text>
