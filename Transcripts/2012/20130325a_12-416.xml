            <text syncTime="127.913" offset="619406">That is, in -- in the Hatch-Waxman settlement context, by definition, we have a disagreement by parties as to the relative merits of the infringement and -- and/or invalidity questions as to the patent infringement suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.321" offset="673009">The brand name is saying its patent is valid and infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.590" offset="686175">The generic is saying either that the patent is invalid or that its own conduct won't be infringing or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.327" offset="709058">And if the generic wins, it will be able to enter the market immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.213" offset="724627">If the brand name wins, it will be able to keep the generic off until the patent expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.766" offset="742808">And so in that circumstance, a logical subject of compromise would be to agree upon an entry date in between those two end points, just as the parties to a damages action would be expected to settle the case by the defendant agreeing to pay a portion of the money it would have to pay if it lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.811" offset="811040">That's an actual subject of compromise and we don't have a problem with that.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="197.441" offset="897558">--for something that it's done acting within the scope of the patent?</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="200.109" offset="908216">Yes, if you adopt Respondent's conception of what it means to act within the scope of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.211" offset="924621">And let me explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.163" offset="928382">When the Respondents say that the restrictions at issue here are within the scope of the patent, what they mean is that the goods that are being restricted are arguably encompassed by the patent and the restriction doesn't extend past the date when the patent expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.507" offset="989822">That's all they mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.873" offset="995256">And if that were the exclusive test, the defendants in Masonite, in New Wrinkle Inline Material, they would all have been off the hook, because all of those cases involved restrictions on trade in patented goods during the period that the patent was in effect, and yet, the Court found antitrust liability in each of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.186" offset="1076549">Now, the way that Respondent tries to explain Masonite, for example, Masonite involved a resale price maintenance agreement in which the patentholder sold goods and then attempted to control the price at which they would be resold, and the Court said that under the rule of patent exhaustion, the patentholder didn't have the right to do that and therefore the patent laws provided no shield and the agreement was held to be a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.373" offset="1193264">Now, Respondents say, well, that's consistent with their theory because the restriction imposed went beyond the scope of the patent because the right to control resale is not one of the rights that the Patent Act confers.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.830" offset="1243106">But if that's the test for whether a restriction is within the scope of the patent, then we would say that it's not met here, because there's nothing in the Patent Act that says you can pay your competitor not to engage in conduct that you believe to be infringing.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.959" offset="1303605">And really that's the thrust of their position, that if you have -- if a patentholder has a non-sham allegation that a particular mode of competition would be an infringement of its patent, the patentholder can pay the competitor not to engage in that competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.052" offset="1364000">Again, we are not talking about conduct in which there has been any judicial determination that infringement has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.205" offset="1388555">We are just talking about cases in which the patentholder has a non-sham allegation that infringement would occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.609" offset="1414260">Mr. Stewart, does this represent a change in the government's position?</text>
            <text syncTime="330.828" offset="1431083">I got the idea from the briefs that at the time of this Schering-Plough case, that was also before the Eleventh Circuit, that the government was not taking that position it's now taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.154" offset="1488343">Well, the FTC has consistently taken this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.106" offset="1500151">The Department of Justice, up until 2009, we didn't endorse the scope of the patent test.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.574" offset="1522093">Indeed, in our invitation brief in Joblove we specifically said that the scope-of-the-patent test was -- didn't provide for enough scrutiny of these settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.514" offset="1553858">But what we advocated, what the Department of Justice advocated, instead was a test that would focus on the strength and scope of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.285" offset="1592937">That is, the likelihood that the brand name would ultimately have prevailed if the suit had been litigated to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.875" offset="1619269">And in 2009 for the first time in an amicus brief filed in the Second Circuit, we took essentially the position that we're taking here, that is that agreements of this sort should be treated as presumptively unlawful with the presumption able to be rebutted in various ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.493" offset="1937754">And so if the parties believe that the brand name was likely to prevail, then if the brand name agreed to early generic entry at all, it would presumably be for a fairly small amount of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.616" offset="1982266">Conversely, if the parties collectively believe that the generic -- that the brand name had a weak case and the generic was likely to prevail, then they would negotiate for an earlier date.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.424" offset="2025421">And the problem with the reverse payment is that it gives the generic an incentive to accept something other than competition as a means of earning money.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.202" offset="2404614">To take along analogy, for example, if Watson instead of developing a generic equivalent to AndroGel, had developed an entirely new drug that it believed would be better than AndroGel for the same conditions and if Solvay had paid Watson not to seek FDA approval and not to seek to market the drug, I think everyone would agree that that was a per se antitrust violation, even though Watson's ultimate ability to market the new drug would depend on FDA approval that might or might not be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.024" offset="2535853">And so when we say it's unlawful to buy off uncertain competition, it's unlawful to buy out competition even when the competition might have been prevented by other means, we are just enforcing standard antitrust principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.397" offset="2581411">To focus on the distinction between Hatch-Waxman and other patent litigation, Professor Hovenkamp's conclusion is that the reason that you don't see payments like this in the normal patent infringement suit is that in the typical market if a patentholder were known to have paid a large sum of money to a competitor who had been making a challenge to the patent, if other competitors knew that that had happened, then they would perceive that to be a sign that the patent was weak and that they would leap in.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.203" offset="2708575">But he says Hatch-Waxman makes it more difficult for that to be done, because Hatch-Waxman gives unique incentives to the first paragraph 4 filer.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.325" offset="3773117">It provides -- it provides really two different forms of rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.094" offset="3788164">First our approach says, this is on its face an agreement not to compete, the generic has agreed to stay out of the market for a defined period of time, and the payment gives rise to an inference that the agree -- that the delay that the generic has agreed to is longer than the period that would otherwise reflect its best assessment of its likelihood of -- of success in the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.475" offset="3885653">But then we say, there are basically two different types of ways in which the presumption could be rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.379" offset="3909267">First, the parties can show that the payment was not in consideration for delay, that there was some other commensurate value transferred, and the payment -- and that arrangement would have been entered into even without the larger settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.723" offset="3962662">And then second, we're at least accepting the possibility that brand names and generics could come in and say, even though our payment was for delay, even though we can't identify anything else that the payment could have been consideration for, it's still, quote, “ competitive ” under--</text>

            <text syncTime="979.916" offset="4027445">And they mention at least two others.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.716" offset="4030684">The first one they mention is because the person's already in the market thinks that the next year or two or three years is worth $100 million a year, and the person who's suing thinks it's worth 30 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.075" offset="4084079">And so he says, hey, I have a great idea, I'll give him the 30 million and keep the 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.460" offset="4101633">And -- and that, I don't see why that's anticompetitive if that's what's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.514" offset="4117829">And the second instance they bring up is that it's very hard to break into a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.716" offset="4134652">So for the new generic to come in, he's thinking, giving me two years isn't worth much, because I'll spend a lot of money, it's very hard for me to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.672" offset="4166417">But the defendant -- the defendant who wants this patent kept intact says, I will not only let -- I'll let you in a year earlier and I'll give you enough money so that you can start up a distribution system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.129" offset="4212288">The second seems procompetitive; the first, neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.415" offset="4229424">The problem of deciding whether other matters are or are not really payments for something else, a true nightmare when you start talking about five drugs and different distribution systems, and the matter of whether you're paying for litigation costs, a matter of great debate for the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.627" offset="4294312">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.227" offset="4296715">That's the arguments that they make.</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.297" offset="4320957">The first is that to the extent that these inquiries are difficult, they're difficult only by -- because the brand names and the generics have made them difficult by tacking on additional transactions to their settlement proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.005" offset="4371844">And to take an analogy, there are government ethics rules that say that -- what are called prohibited sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.925" offset="4395458">Basically, people who have business before the department can't give me gifts as a government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.812" offset="4414998">Now, obviously, it would be absurd to have a rule that said a prohibited source couldn't give me a Rolex watch, but could sell me a Rolex watch for a dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.585" offset="4450106">And so the ethics rules treat as a gift an exchange for value in which fair market value is not paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.422" offset="4481453">And everybody understands that once you go down that route, occasionally, you will have hard cases in which people could legitimately agree, was this a legitimate arm's length exchange or was it a concealed gift?</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.980" offset="4527742">But the prospect of those difficult cases doesn't mean that we get rid of a gift ban altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.700" offset="4550521">And certainly, Federal employees couldn't bring the -- the ethics office to its knees by engaging in such a proliferation of these side deals that the ethics office decided it's not worth it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.275" offset="4596915">The second thing is that Respondent's approach would apply even when there are no hard questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.679" offset="4618440">Respondents would say that even if the agreement provides for delayed generic entry until the date the patent expires, and even if the only other term of the agreement is the brand name pays the generic a lot of money, that that would be a legitimate agreement, because the restriction would apply to arguably patented drugs and it wouldn't extend beyond the date of patent expiration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.908" offset="4703390">I guess the -- the other thing I would say about the way in which these payments can facilitate settlement really shows their anticompetitive potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.014" offset="4739857">That is, suppose the parties were negotiating for a compromise date of entry, but they couldn't agree; the -- the brand name said beginning of 2017 is the earliest we'll let you in and the generic said beginning of 2015 is the latest date that we would accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.540" offset="4805894">Now, the Respondents use the term “ bridge the gap ”, but there's obviously no way that a payment from the brand name to the generic could enable the parties to agree on an entry date between 2015 and 2017.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.781" offset="4862946">The brand name is never going to say, well, I would insist on holding out until 2017, but if I'm going to pay you a whole lot of money, then I'll let you earlier and accept a -- a diminution of your profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.421" offset="4905473">The brand name is going to say, if I pay you money, I'm going to insist on deferring entry even later than the 2017 date that would otherwise be my preferred compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.963" offset="4947582">So the natural effect of these payments is not to facilitate a -- a bridging the gap in the sense of a picking of a point between the dates that the parties would otherwise insist on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.735" offset="4990737">It is going -- it is very likely to cause the parties to agree to an entry date that's even later than the one the brand name would otherwise find acceptable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3054.197" offset="12324562">And that's not bad, because most patent cases settle.</text>

            <text syncTime="3219.755" offset="12986818">This was the exact problem that Congress addressed in 2003, when it amended Hatch-Waxman and changed the exclusivity requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.528" offset="13021927">So the way the law now reads is that subsequent generics, subsequent filers can trigger that 180-day exclusivity by continuing to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.018" offset="13071873">So, if the first filer settles and these other folks are in line and they're litigating, they can force that period to start running and then they can come in right after.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.041" offset="13107922">So, it is not correct that you can tie up the first filer in settlement and prevent everybody else from entering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.297" offset="13136970">And even before that amendment, the Eleventh Circuit, Federal circuit in the Second, applying the scope of the patent rule recognized that if the agreement creates a bottleneck to other filers that goes beyond what the statutory exclusivity provides, where they agree not to give up their exclusivity or agree to retain it, then that's beyond the scope of the patent, because you can't achieve that kind of a restraint simply -- with a patent, you -- you're using the agreement to expand upon your patent rights to block other filers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.579" offset="13542077">Mr. Weinberger argued that in order to determine whether a settlement of this sort has anticompetitive effects, we would have to know how the lawsuit would have turned out, but it's perhaps the most fundamental principle of antitrust law that particular conduct can be legal or illegal, depending on the deliberative process that led up to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.672" offset="13610413">And to put that in concrete terms, if a business charges a particular price for a particular product, because it's made the assessment that this will maximize profits in a competitive environment, that decision is almost immune from antitrust scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.448" offset="13665584">But if the business charges the same price for the same product in the same market because it's agreed with its competitor that it will charge that price, that's a per se antitrust violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.490" offset="13705708">So it's not at all anomalous to say that this type of agreement can be deemed anticompetitive, even though the same result, namely, exclusion of the generic from the market might have been able to be obtained by other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.480" offset="13761715">The second thing is, Mr. Weinberger said there are instances in which second and successive filers will attempt to challenge the brand name even after the first filer has been bought off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.521" offset="13805809">I think we -- we disagree that it's as easy as he would say it is, but we'll concede it happens occasionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.275" offset="13832872">But the fact that particular anticompetitive conduct doesn't always work doesn't make it lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.429" offset="13853457">It could often happen that two firms were thinking about entering into a price-fixing agreement, for instance, but thought to themselves, if we do that, there's a third competitor in the market who will be able to undersell us, and this would make our agreement unprofitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.173" offset="13912493">And it might happen sometimes that two firms try to proceed with a price-fixing conspiracy, but they're thwarted because of the unexpected competition from a third firm.</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.984" offset="13987726">That seems quite different than saying there's another firm out there in the abstract that -- that might want to enter into a similar market sharing arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3484.327" offset="14045091">But if the brand name perceived on a systemic basis that the likely result of paying off one competitor was that another competitor would step in and couldn't be bought off would litigate the suit to judgment, there would be no incentive to make the reverse payment in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.021" offset="14111860">That is, in making the reverse payment, what the -- the brand name is attempting to purchase is protection from the possibility that it will have its patent invalidated, and it will suffer a large competitive advantage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3555.006" offset="14327840">And is there anything to show what I think Justice Kennedy asked -- you know, how much of one's profits comes from the 180-day period as opposed to what happens after that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3564.112" offset="14364203">I know it is the great majority, I don't have a percentage figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.398" offset="14377368">And the reason, as I indicated earlier, was that during the 180-day exclusivity period, you have only two competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.552" offset="14402028">Basically, a biopoly arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.605" offset="14414149">And my understanding is that the generics would usually charge around 80 to 85 percent of the brand name's price during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.942" offset="14443511">And after there is full competition, the price would drop to a fraction of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.227" offset="14460647">The next thing I would say is that our system encourages settlement, but not to the nth degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.448" offset="14481545">And so, for instance, if you had two -- two firms fighting over a million dollars and each firm decided internally, 600,000 is the least I will accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.904" offset="14519370">If they stuck to their guns, the case couldn't be settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.439" offset="14529506">Now, if the public could be made to kick in an additional 200,000, then each of the firms could get its 600,000 and walk away content.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.961" offset="14559599">But we don't pursue the policy in favor of settlement to that degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.980" offset="14575690">But that's essentially what's happening here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.948" offset="14583527">The -- the way these payments facilitate settlement is by inducing the generics to agree to a later entry date by increasing the total pool of profits that are available to the two firms combined and thereby maximizing the likelihood that each firm will find its own share of the profit satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.077" offset="14660118">And the last thing I would say is I think everyone who comes to this issue recognized that there is a conundrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.381" offset="14681329">Our natural instinct is to compare the settlement to the expected outcome of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.452" offset="14701600">But everyone also recognizes that it just isn't feasible to try the patent suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.837" offset="14719155">And, therefore, our approach focuses on whether the competitive process has been preserved.</text>
