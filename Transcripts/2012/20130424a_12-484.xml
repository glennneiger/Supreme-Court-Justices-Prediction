            <text syncTime="16.693" offset="174254">This Court's decision in Gross does most of the work in this case and the plain language of the 1991 amendments to Title VII do the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.531" offset="205601">Under Gross, Nassar must prove that retaliation was the but-for cause of the challenged employment action unless Congress has specifically relieved him of that burden by authorizing a mixed motive claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.423" offset="253144">In -- in the 1991 amendments, however, Congress authorized mixed motive treatment only for Title VII claims that challenge -- that challenge discrimination based on membership in a protected class, not for retaliation claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.481" offset="305389">And for that reason, a Title VII retaliation claim must prove but-for causation.</text>

            <text syncTime="70.894" offset="390966">They'd both be governed by the same standard, isn't that right, in the age discrimination area, the but-for causation?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daryl L. Joseffer</label>
            <text syncTime="85.401" offset="449062">So for this purpose in the Age Act, everything is but-for, that's correct.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="88.170" offset="460138">But your argument is that in Title VII, where it's very clear what the standard Congress wants to have for the discrimination claim, you're going to have a different standard for retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.779" offset="518548">So, in these statutes, I thought these two traveled together, whatever the standard is for discrimination is the same for retaliation.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.732" offset="638398">Well, I guess the question, Mr. Joseffer, is, is there any other discrimination statute in which one can say that there's a different standard for proving retaliation than there is for proving substantive discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="145.958" offset="691269">Because as I sort of survey the universe, it seems as though whatever the standard is, the standard is the same for both, and there's no statute in which the two have been divorced.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.682" offset="738185">Am I wrong about that?</text>

            <text syncTime="168.122" offset="779877">It's -- it's but-for everywhere except for within the meaning of this one amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.324" offset="792729">Congress clearly intended to make an exception here to the normal but-for, so the question is to the scope of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.609" offset="1113826">And you're coming in here and asking for the first time in all of those many decades that we should divorce the retaliation claim from the substantive discrimination claim and make them follow two different standards; is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="284.663" offset="1246110">And the -- I mean, the backdrop here, which is the whole point of Gross, right, is that as of Price Waterhouse, we had, you know, a somewhat confusing and murky alignment of opinions, that -- and I think everyone agrees with this -- interpreted only at Section 2a, the discrimination based on class provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.423" offset="1305147">Then, two years later, Congress came in with this amendment to specifically identify what it wanted to do about mixed motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.077" offset="1331792">And Gross says that except for when Congress has specifically called for this mixed motive treatment, it's but-for is the holding of Gross.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.164" offset="1360109">And when we look to this provision -- I mean, there are different ways of looking at it, but one would be to say that I'm not aware of any statute that has a specific retaliation provision where this Court has construed discrimination based on class generally to encompass retaliation, because that would make the retaliation provision here in 3a absolutely surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.327" offset="1440775">It would make the other statutory cross-references to 3a surplusage, because you'd be taking the specific retaliation provision within Title VII and subsuming it within a general treatment of discrimination based on -- on class, race, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.552" offset="1493647">And this basic structure of these provisions of Title VII is that when Congress wants to refer to all Title VII discrimination claims, it will refer as it did in subsection 2n to a claim of employment discrimination, generally; it will refer as it did also in section 2 to an unlawful employment practice, which would cover the waterfront, but when it wants to cover a specific subset, it refers to retaliation as spelled out in 3(a), or to discrimination based on membership in one of the five protected classes.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.487" offset="1921428">--As a matter -- well, as a matter of statutory interpretation, right, which then drives the outcome, the difference is that if -- if you treat a specific retaliation reference or provision as being subsumed within a more general one, a discrimination based on race, for example, you are treating the specific retaliation reference to be surplusage, to have no effect and to not need to be there, and you're treating the other statutory cross-references to it as also being surplusages, which is why, when Congress does speaks more directly this Court's never overridden, never said that it will take a specific retaliation provision and treat it like it's not there and toss it and -- based on race, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.494" offset="2065415">And that's why -- I mean, that's why those general cases they cite, those are our cases, because Jackson specifically says that Title VII is vastly different for this very reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.414" offset="2397065">So Congress hadn't forgotten that it was treating them differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.433" offset="2409186">Also, in this very provision, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress specifically cross-referenced both the part of Title VII that contains the general provision and the part of VII, Section 3, that contains retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.741" offset="2462372">So it's specifically dealing with these separate provisions, acknowledging that it has in fact presumptively at least has read them and understands the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.263" offset="2492465">I mean, I think we presume it anyhow, but we know it from the actual statutory text of the '91 -- 1991 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="742.685" offset="3078130">One is the general provision for discrimination because of membership in a class.</text>

            <text syncTime="750.958" offset="3111253">So this defines basically a third way of establishing whether an employment practice is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.195" offset="3132256">And what it says is that any employment practice that is motivated by one of the five listed factors is an unlawful employment practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.194" offset="5108158">And textually, but it then describes seven different unlawful employment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.646" offset="5122055">Discrimination based on the five classes and discrimination based on the two types of protected conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.883" offset="5142953">This provision then applies to the five practices and leaves out the two types of protected conduct, which is why, textually speaking, and there's no contrary legislative history, Congress meant to apply this to some, but not all types of unlawful conduct -- of unlawful -- of employment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.809" offset="5206692">And the reason that that's perfectly rational is three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.695" offset="5222261">First, as I mentioned, this is the secondary of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.130" offset="5231978">Second, it sweeps -- by its nature, retaliation sweeps so much broader, well outside of the traditional workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.467" offset="5257265">While Congress was thinking about jettisoning traditional burdens of proof and relieving a plaintiff of the -- of the traditional burden of proving its own case, they could certainly balk at doing that in a much broader setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.889" offset="5294985">And third, the potential for meritless and abusive suits is particularly pronounced in a retaliation context, because any employee at all can opt into a retaliation claim by making a -- a charge of -- a relevant charge, knowing that -- you know, potentially knowing that, yeah, the writing's on the wall, probably I'm going to get fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.355" offset="5388817">And if you then flip the burden so the plaintiff doesn't have prove its own claim, the plaintiff can point to the timing of his own complaint, the inevitable employment action would have happened anyway, and the proximity, then, is probably going to get the plaintiff past summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.562" offset="5433643">Now, what you're then looking at is an expensive and unpredictable trial, most defendants will be forced to settle even meritless claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.899" offset="5459034">And the EEOC's own statistics show that, one, retaliation claims have become all the rage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.870" offset="5482963">They are the -- the leading type of claims being raised these days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.489" offset="5493412">And, two, the EEOC's reasonable cause determination show that only 5 percent of them have even reasonable cause to support them, which is not an especially high standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.380" offset="5532909">So when we're talking about a potential massive amount and growing amount of mostly meritless but expensive litigation to defend, it's perfectly reasonable for Congress to decide, well, within the scope of what Price Waterhouse was exactly dealing with -- to get back -- to get back to Justice Kagan's point -- we'll have -- we'll allow some mixed motive treatment there, but that'll be it now, because -- because there are other issues with retaliation that caused -- caused Congress to reasonably do exactly what it so clearly did in statutory text.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.458" offset="13621255">Justice Scalia, you were talking about g-2(a), and if I could just take a moment on that, because that is one of the arguments that Petitioner is making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.879" offset="13650930">My colleague made the point that it was adopted by the 1964 Congress; it was adopted before Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.699" offset="13678202">And so if I could focus on the 1991 Congress that enacted both subsection (m) and subsection g-2(b), that Congress was acting in light of Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.405" offset="13721043">And we know it was legislating with full knowledge of Sullivan, because that's exactly what this Court said in CBOCS.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.975" offset="13743299">CBOCS involved Section 101, rather, of the 1991 Act; this involves Section 107 of the 1991 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.314" offset="13776736">So we know that when Congress was writing (m) and when it was writing g-2(b), it knew, because of Sullivan, that it didn't need extra words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.937" offset="13807142">It didn't need redundant words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.320" offset="13812680">It didn't have to say under Section 2000e-2 and Section 2000e-3; it could simply say exactly what it said in (m), and that would do the trick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.812" offset="13854685">And it's a common rule of statutory interpretation that you don't add extra words if you don't need them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.132" offset="13879972">And so what Congress did in (m) is it adopted exactly what words it needed to effectuate its purpose, which is to have one causation standard, a motivating factor standard available with respect to all intentional discrimination claims--</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.523" offset="13933575">But the maxim that you don't add words where you don't need them doesn't -- doesn't help your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.860" offset="13954891">It hurts your case, because in the other provision that was carried over from the prior law, you -- you were making a nullity of the -- the addition after referring to discrimination on the basis of race, of, you know, retaliation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3481.489" offset="14033363">To answer that question, it's important -- what happened in 1991, Congress didn't add that language, it didn't amend that language; it simply didn't delete it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.511" offset="14065441">And I think it's completely reasonable when Congress is faced with a choice of deleting language that had been there for 25 years that wasn't a problem, it's just at worst was redundant, chose to leave it in place lest any negative inference arise from the deletion, and simply legislate in subsection (m), in g-2(b), based on the new understanding that the Court adopted in Sullivan.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daryl L. Joseffer</label>
            <text syncTime="3517.145" offset="14175991">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.947" offset="14199188">This case seems to boil down to two very simple legislative drafting rules or interpretive principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.434" offset="14221131">The first is, from Gross, we know that Congress doesn't relieve the plaintiff of the traditional burden of proof unless it specifically indicates so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.439" offset="14253209">And so then we talk to subsection (m) where the relevant bases are the litany of race, color, sex, religion, and national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.193" offset="14284243">So the second interpretive principle is, then, does that litany here encompass, you know, complaining about unlawful conduct and participating in an investigation, which are the protected conduct for purposes of retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.103" offset="14335861">That principle comes straight out of Jackson and Gomez-Perez, that when Congress broadly refers to discrimination on the basis of race in the statute without greater specificity, the Court will read retaliation in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.911" offset="14383090">When Congress breaks it out, the surplusage canon -- and I agree with Justice Scalia, I really didn't understand why they were talking about that -- and also the general canon is the same canon, which is, put differently, is that specific provisions, you know, control over general ones, they're not subsumed within them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.670" offset="14442127">That tells us that when Congress is speaking more specifically, it's speaking more specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.622" offset="14461875">Here, that tells Congress very clearly how to amend these statutes when it wishes to, which it does all the time, and how the courts -- and how lower courts should construe them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.811" offset="14498656">In addition, Title VII, as a whole, is especially clear, because the same subsection 2 within Title VII, when it wants to refer to all types of employment discrimination, it will say “ a claim of employment discrimination ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.321" offset="14548706">And by the way, the 1991 Congress put that provision in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.522" offset="14561558">So this Congress knew how to say “ any claim of employment discrimination ”, as it did so in subsection (n), which comes right after this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.843" offset="14586845">Congress will also say “ an unlawful employment practice ” when it's referring to all of them, but when it wants to specifically refer to one subset or another, it does so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.199" offset="14624252">That's a clear, logical, coherent reading of the statute as a whole that every court of appeals to consider the question has adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.953" offset="14651211">They're asking you to read various statutory provisions to be surplusage, and there's simply no reason to do so, especially because, looking just at 1991, Congress at that point was not saying, oh, in light of Jackson, we can now just speak more generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.196" offset="14708262">Because it, specifically in 1991, cross-referenced the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII when it wanted to, and it specifically used broader phrases like “ a claim of employment discrimination ” when it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.603" offset="14757895">And especially since the whole point of Gross, or much of the point of Gross was to replace a -- a totally unworkable and confusing regime with something that is clear and straightforward, you've done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.644" offset="14798019">And the question now is whether to retreat back into a jurisprudential morass where, within the very same statute, the drafting rules this Court has otherwise articulated, no longer apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.434" offset="14841173">The final point I'd make is that, yeah, there's this question about are -- are we treating, you know, retaliation and -- and substantive discrimination differently within one statute, and the answer is, well, yes, as Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.158" offset="14888089">The other way of looking at it is they want to treat retaliation differently in this statute than it's treated in every other statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.061" offset="14911704">You can -- you can point to similar anomalies across the board, the reason being that Congress has chosen to have two different sections within this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.317" offset="14940752">And--</text>
