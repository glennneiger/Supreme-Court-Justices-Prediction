            <text syncTime="12.728" offset="156868">Adrian Moncrieffe was convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana under Georgia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.381" offset="183408">The question in the case is whether he was thereby convicted of a controlled substances offense, which is a deportable offense, but also an aggravated felony of illicit trafficking in drugs, which would mean that the Attorney General has no discretion to cancel his removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.747" offset="248923">Now, everyone agrees that under the Georgia statute, there is going to be some conduct that would be a Federal felony, but it's also undisputed that the Georgia statute regularly involves prosecutions that would be Federal misdemeanors.</text>

            <text syncTime="57.612" offset="336381">This is the information I can give you about Federal and state prosecutions of marijuana cases in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.874" offset="369400">In the state system, the most recent available data -- it was published by the Department of Justice in 2006, but we have no reason to believe that it's changed materially -- in 2006, there were roughly 750,000 prosecutions in the states for marijuana offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.167" offset="434601">By contrast, in the Federal system, we have data from 2010.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.601" offset="452365">And we have two different kinds of data here that is a little bit more granular, and that is for prosecutions under 841(b)(1), which is the trafficking provision, there were 6,200 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.595" offset="504296">For prosecutions under 841(b)(4), which is the provision we say you ought to look at here, and 844, which is the possession provision, combined, there were only 93 prosecutions in 2010.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.430" offset="567617">And what we think that illustrates is that there is a massive amount of activity in the states doing things that show that this -- and this case is perfectly commonplace, we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.553" offset="600113">It's consistent with the other cases that we've seen published by the BIA.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.679" offset="760610">One is going to be at the back of the blue brief, where we have the chemist's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.113" offset="778373">So page 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.549" offset="788090">This is from the -- the record in the immigration proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.783" offset="801047">And on page 19 of the appendix to our blue brief -- we just agreed, because there was so little record material, that we wouldn't have a joint appendix in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.998" offset="837932">We just published it at the end of our brief -- it says,</text>

            <text syncTime="188.932" offset="861651">And for those of us who've been fortunate enough not to experience the drug laws a lot, that's less than half the weight of this penny.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.945" offset="885684">So it's, I think everybody agrees, a small amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.002" offset="961961">So then, on the question of remuneration -- and I should just step back and explain, the reason we're talking about this is that the Federal misdemeanor provision, 841(b)(4), says that it's not a felony, and thus, it wouldn't be an aggravated felony, if it's a small amount and no remuneration.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.933" offset="1013684">And Justice Ginsburg asked about the -- what's in the record about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.166" offset="1022565">Now, there isn't record evidence about no remuneration, but there is one significant fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.771" offset="1045031">And to know that fact, you have to look at the Georgia statute, which is also at the end of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.833" offset="1061227">It's on page 9 of our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.910" offset="1073557">This is the statute he was prosecuted under.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.253" offset="1086931">It's the second provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.362" offset="1095395">Section 16-13-30(j)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="251.250" offset="1110964">And I'll just read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.611" offset="1116397">"It is unlawful for any person to possess, have under his control, manufacture, deliver, distribute, dispense, administer, purchase, sell. "</text>

            <text syncTime="264.653" offset="1164567">And he was not charged with and he was not convicted of selling, and so we think that should negative any indication -- any implication that he might have gotten remuneration for this.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.517" offset="1259966">Would -- would an immigration judge, under the argument you're making today, have to ignore that allocution, or would he be able to apply the modified approach and find this gentleman an aggravated felon?</text>

            <text syncTime="314.585" offset="1364247">There's no -- the only reason that you would look at the modified categorical approach here is to know that it was a possession with intent to distribute conviction rather than a sale conviction, but that evidence would still come in.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.499" offset="1599976">It's not as big as their problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.778" offset="1604992">Because, as this Court explained in Carachuri-Rosendo, the offense still is removable, and the Attorney General will just deny cancellation of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.118" offset="1642399">Now, the reason they have a much bigger practical problem is that their rule is overinclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.879" offset="4745432">What he certainly can do is direct the immigration judges to place special weight -- and this was the rule before 1996, by the way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.797" offset="5533077">So here's what we tried to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.372" offset="5539450">This statute, (b)(4), was enacted in 1970, some 42 years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="1372.538" offset="5596084">And I would be really interested to know if my friend is able to identify one case in 42 years which it actually made a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.505" offset="5619908">And the reason is, in an actual Federal prosecution, the FBI agent would come in and say, here are the drugs, and they were trying to sell it to an undercover officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.924" offset="5653658">It's never the case that it actually -- the defendant is in a position of trying to prove that it was a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.249" offset="5678944">But what they are trying to do is to take that rule which is derived from Apprendi, that there is a burden of proof so that the government doesn't have to indict that it wasn't a (b)(4) offense, and take the silence of the state record, where these facts are completely irrelevant, the quantity and remuneration, and transpose them into the Federal system and take great advantage of the fact that the record is silent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.652" offset="7244515">And so the person -- and an aggravated felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.976" offset="7261860">So you say under the elements approach, this person has committed an aggravated felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.182" offset="9862611">It involved a recidivism factor, an aggravating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.555" offset="9876195">When you are talking about an aggravating factor Apprendi jurisprudence has treated those somewhat equivalent to an element, because it raises the statutory maximum.</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.125" offset="9938471">The other thing I would say about Carachuri is that it's easily distinguishable on the grounds that Justice Ginsburg raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.311" offset="9959160">It -- the Government's argument in Carachuri was much more difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.420" offset="9971594">The Government was trying to rely on a recidivism factor that was not part of the predicate conviction, and it was trying to rely on that factor to elevate what was otherwise a misdemeanor under both State and Federal law to a felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="2529.162" offset="10222579">First is by looking at how this Court has consistently formulated the categorical inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.298" offset="10243163">Starting with Taylor, pre-Apprendi case, compare the elements of the predicate offense to the those of the generic offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.484" offset="10271898">Fast forward past Apprendi through all of the more recent cases, Lopez and not -- still the same inquiry, focusing on the elements of the predicate and the elements of the generic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.887" offset="10301468">If that is not enough for you, Justice Sotomayor, if there is still some uncertainty as to when you have mitigating factors, like in this case, and the question is, well, does the predicate conviction have to affirmatively negate those narrow mitigating criteria, then this Court can look, if it wants to go to first principles, look at this Court's decision in Nijhawan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.316" offset="10383179">There, it had a different aggravating felony, certain fraud and deceit offenses which resulted in a $10,000 loss to the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.485" offset="10415885">What the Court said, look, fraud and deceit, those are clearly elements, we are going to apply the categorical approach to figure out whether those elements are satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.951" offset="10449739">But the $10,000 loss factor, we're not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.420" offset="10459561">We're not sure whether the predicate offense has to affirmatively establish it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.012" offset="10482027">And so what the Court did is it did a survey of the 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.869" offset="10497387">It looked at the 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.257" offset="10502925">And it turns out that in a vast majority of those states, the predicate conviction will never establish that $10,000 loss factor, and so you're going to have a vastly underinclusive aggravated felony, and that's something that Congress -- that Congress could not have intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.811" offset="10565201">The Court said Congress would not have intended its aggravated felony provision to apply in such a limited and haphazard manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.766" offset="10589024">I submit that's exactly what you have here on pages 26 to 30 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3082.978" offset="12437867">Well, we can look at the inquiry that the Court did in Nijhawan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.911" offset="12457615">It would not be -- it would not be consistent with congressional intent to assume that Congress intended that this aggravated felony provision would not have any effect in the clear majority of states that do not make either remuneration or more than a small quantity an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.141" offset="12522503">That is what Nijhawan was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.986" offset="12529922">It was trying to figure out, did Congress intend this particular piece of the aggravated felony description to be subject to the categorical approach or not; that is, did it require the predicate conviction to establish or negate it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.682" offset="12588645">And the right way to look at that is to look at the state of the State laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.194" offset="12606722">And here we know that in a clear majority of States, they do not require remuneration, they do not require more than a small amount, you will never get an aggravated felony conviction out of a majority of States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.447" offset="13331672">It also has implications beyond the immigration context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.286" offset="13343062">At the same time that Congress enacted this aggravated felony provision, it made it a sentencing enhancement provision in criminal prosecutions for illegal reentry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.017" offset="13389978">And so in any illegal reentry prosecution, if the defendant is also -- has a prior conviction for marijuana distribution, they would be subject to a significant sentencing enhancement under both the guidelines and section 1326, the Illegal Reentry Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.041" offset="13458105">If Petitioner's rule were to prevail in a significant number of those cases in any State in which it did not have those relevant elements, that sentencing enhancement would no longer have operative effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3425.351" offset="13807310">But the question is if you actually adopt their statutory construction argument and you say we're going to look at the elements and it's an aggravated felony, we're comparing two different ways of reading it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.285" offset="13843045">And they admit that their way of reading the statute comes up with an answer that Congress couldn't possibly have intended by treating all these misdemeanants as aggravated felons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.655" offset="13880557">Now, their solution is to add a whole 'nother proceeding that isn't in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.543" offset="13896126">Another solution is just to recognize their reading is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.587" offset="13912322">If it produces this ridiculous result that Congress couldn't have intended and our reading is perfectly sensible and not only do you have the solution of the removal proceedings, but also Justice Kennedy's suggestion of the Attorney General's ability to issue an order; Justice Sotomayor's solution of being able to look at the plea allocution, questions that aren't presented here, but lots of ways of addressing any adverse consequences of our rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3494.103" offset="14082327">It's not punishable as an 841 felony, unless those two things are absent and therefore they have the hearing to find out.</text>

            <text syncTime="3508.816" offset="14141155">But I don't think that's actually what they're doing because Mr. Shah did not deny Justice Kagan's questions about yeah, it would produce this ridiculous result and so we're going to add this other proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.093" offset="14178353">When they say -- what they do with punishable is they say look at only the elements of the Federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.697" offset="14200714">And that's how they say that any Georgia conviction, even though, Justice Ginsburg, lots of these convictions will just be equivalents to Federal misdemeanors, because they are the equivalent of -- because they involve possession with intent to distribute, those are the only elements of the offense, then they're all punishable as felonies even if they would be a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.815" offset="14277201">So I don't think punishable helps them, and they don't seem to argue on the basis of punishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.077" offset="14294232">So my base point to you is that why, in choosing between these two readings, we have strengths, they have strengths.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.185" offset="14314712">Their argument starts from the proposition that theirs produces a result that Congress couldn't have intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.715" offset="14336760">And, Mr. Chief Justice, they did start out with the hardcore position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.962" offset="14353792">I can give you the example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.085" offset="14358285">It's our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.916" offset="14361628">Remember, even though this is 1.3 grams, even though he was not convicted of selling, they ordered him mandatorily deportable without an inquiry into the underlying facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.128" offset="14402484">They recognize that can't be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.534" offset="14412097">And so they are trying to tack something on to the statute that doesn't appear in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.203" offset="14426725">The last point that I want to address is actually a very small one, and that's about Justice Thomas's dissent in the Lopez case on whether you should look to the State definition of whether this is a felony or instead, the Federal one, because the Government cites it in a footnote in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.886" offset="14485449">And we would only say that the Government is not relying on the Lopez dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.102" offset="14502376">It invokes Lopez repeatedly in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.993" offset="14517945">And so, this is a situation in which the Court's decision in Lopez should take hold as a matter of statutory -- stare decisis, and what matters here is the Federal treatment of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.378" offset="14555457">When you don't know if the Georgia conviction is a felony or a misdemeanor under Federal law, you don't know which one it is, what the categorical rule says is that the State conviction doesn't necessarily establish it's a Federal offense, the Federal felony here, and therefore, you don't treat it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.716" offset="14624838">The arguments that my friend ended with, ended with about hey, this is going to be applied in Federal sentencing and lots of other contexts makes it worse, not better.</text>
