            <text syncTime="671.165" offset="2792495">Now, the victim and the tortfeasor enter into a settlement and you have a rule and the rule is you will never get more than 50,000 or 33 percent, whichever is less.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.552" offset="3042017">So my thought, which is wrong I guess, is if the judge says it's 10 percent you won't take more than 10 percent, but if in fact it's a stipulation of 10 percent North Carolina courts have not yet decided that, and this is a case where there is no stipulation and no judicial finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.923" offset="6687457">The -- General Maddrey has steadfastly argued that the North Carolina statute overrides a jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.378" offset="6729253">I think his argument is well-grounded, given the language of the statute, but that illustrates the very problem here, that this statute takes one-third of a settlement or judgment regardless of the true facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.323" offset="6793096">And that is problematic under Ahlborn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.692" offset="6806575">Justice Kagan, you had asked Mr. -- General Maddrey about the basis for the North Carolina statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.096" offset="6836146">General Maddrey had referred to it being a rule of thumb of three times medicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.785" offset="6866970">But if you actually turn to the Fourth Circuit's decision, which is based on the briefs that were filed in the Fourth Circuit, in the petition at page 20A, the rule of thumb is actually three times specials, which of course is different than three times medicals, because special damages would include things like lost wages and various other things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.031" offset="6951921">Mr. Browning, let me give you a different rationale for this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.499" offset="6969788">It's different than the one the State suggests, but it would go something like this:</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.535" offset="6985880">There is an allocation that has to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.718" offset="6994657">In making allocations there are two ways of doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.522" offset="7009912">We can do it case-by-case, individualized decisionmaking; or we can use some bright-line rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.907" offset="7031437">And the advantage of bright-line rules is that they are cheap and efficient and sometimes they are not more inaccurate than individualized decisionmaking, because in individualized decisionmaking you can maker errors, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.233" offset="7084727">So this is a reasonable way to make an allocation decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.220" offset="7104685">And nothing that we said in Ahlborn suggests that a State needs to use case-by case decisionmaking rather than bright-line rules to make the allocation that it needs to make between medical and nonmedical damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.772" offset="7430902">And under North Carolina's theory, if Arkansas had simply been bright enough to implement a cap, the Ahlborn decision would have been completely different.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.343" offset="7957112">And the victim's lawyer in fact would like as little as possible to be allocated to a source which is going to take that money away from him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3608.962" offset="14543627">It's not guessing after the fact, but instead providing in advance, the recipe as to how to put the settlement together.</text>

            <text syncTime="3680.558" offset="14830033">If in that hypothetical the medical expenses were 100,000 or 10 percent, the North Carolina statute would say North Carolina gets up to one-third of the settlement but never more than they paid.</text>
