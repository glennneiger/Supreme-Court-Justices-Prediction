            <text syncTime="84.504" offset="443912">But that same principle applies to the three things that the bulk solicitation -- the bulk use provision governs, and particularly when you look at the history underlying the statute which was very much aimed at use of the information for direct marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.247" offset="498978">And so, as I was saying, Congress made clear--</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph R. Guerra</label>
            <text syncTime="121.862" offset="593437">--Justice Sotomayor, I believe what your first question -- your first example sounded like it was a noncommercial use.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.349" offset="623321">I think that in the case where the State is acting as a commercial entity, the same rules we would -- we would apply with respect to lawyer solicitation would apply there.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.991" offset="661878">And the reason I say that and the reason I think it's so clear that Congress intended that really lies in the language of subsection (b)(2), because there Congress made clear that it understood that these provisions are not wholly independent permissions and in fact that the consent requirement governs all commercial bulk use absent an explicit exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.218" offset="742857">If you take a look, it's in the second page of the addendum to our opening brief, and it says that</text>
            <text syncTime="165.122" offset="766472">"Personal information may be used in connection with matters of motor vehicle market research activity, including survey research. "</text>
            <text syncTime="172.628" offset="796461">Congress included the survey research clause because a commercial bulk survey using personal information would otherwise be governed by (b)(12)'s consent requirement and so Congress had to make clear that it was creating an exception for one industry to engage in this one particular type of bulk use.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.689" offset="868663">And the reason we know that the survey research clause means that is because under Respondent's interpretation it has no affect whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.862" offset="905339">If, as they say, each of these clauses is wholly independent and sufficient to authorize whatever it covers, a phrase covering</text>
            <text syncTime="208.318" offset="939194">"in connection with matters of motor vehicle market research activities. "</text>
            <text syncTime="211.853" offset="953404">would in and of itself cover the subset of motor vehicle market research survey research.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.341" offset="979318">So to give that clause any effect you must understand that it's overriding the express consent requirement of (b)(12) and -- such that you now have to, when you look at the other provisions that might authorize bulk commercial use, find a comparably explicit authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.737" offset="1052879">And you can't find that in (b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="239.106" offset="1062387">(B)(4) says nothing about solicitation, much less bulk solicitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.620" offset="1152457">But my point is that in (b)(2) you find an explicit authorization for survey research, which is one of the very three topics covered in (b)(12) itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.541" offset="1188088">When you look at (b)(4), you don't see anything about solicitation, which is the kind of explicit override that (b)(2) indicates Congress wanted or is necessary in order to conclude that another subsection overrides (b)(12)'s express consent requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.718" offset="1248797">Mr. Guerra, I have to admit that given what a mess this statute is, those three words don't quite do it for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.122" offset="1274397">So, the argument against you, right, as using (b)(12) to define (b)(4), is that, look, this is just a list of exceptions to a general prohibition and no one is more general or specific than any other, and all you have to do is fit within one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.587" offset="1364258">And it doesn't matter whether you don't fit within two of them if you don't fit within one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.474" offset="1383798">So then the question would be are you covered by (b)(4) or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="323.926" offset="1401665">If not, are you covered by (b)(12) or not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph R. Guerra</label>
            <text syncTime="326.645" offset="1412532">Well, Justice Kagan, with respect, number one, I don't think you can so readily dismiss the interpretive import of those three words, because they don't have any function other than to override the express consent requirement in (b)(12).</text>
            <text syncTime="339.020" offset="1462061">And if there is no need -- if (b)(12) doesn't apply to any other subsection, there is no need to be overriding it in (b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="345.625" offset="1488392">But we don't rely solely on the force of those three words.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.160" offset="1502603">It's also the case that (b)(2) -- excuse me, (b)(12) is one of the core provisions of the statute in the sense that it's aimed at one of the fundamental problems that prompted passage of the Act in the first place, which was DMV's collecting information, then making it available to direct marketers.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.187" offset="1566655">And so you are in a situation where you've got a core restriction aimed at a core problem this Act is designed to resolve, but whereas (b)(4) is one of the few subsections that authorize access to the most sensitive information that Congress -- excuse me, that DMV were collecting.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.772" offset="1681071">Mr. Chief Justice, what I mean by that is that we know it's core in the sense that it's aimed at one of the core problems that Congress was addressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.545" offset="1712105">And (b)(4), by contrast, is one of the few provisions in which Congress authorized access to the most sensitive information DMVs collect, such as medical and disability status and Social Security numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.603" offset="1760379">And we submit it's simply implausible to think that a Congress concerned with undue public/private access to DMV information would in the same statute grant lawyers the right, a unique right, to use that highly sensitive information in order to engage in bulk solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.314" offset="1831223">And in fact, the legislative record here is devoid of any evidence that Congress was aware that lawyers ever made use of DMV information for solicitation, much less -- or that they contemplated it, much less that Congress made a conscious decision to allow them to--</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.162" offset="6394606">It directly regulates the State's use of their own databases and imposes massive civil liability and criminal penalties for violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.592" offset="6484258">The scope of those 14 permissible use provisions then becomes quite important for determining whether or not a statute that was originally designed primarily to regulate the commercial sale of DMV information becomes intrusive into matters of traditional State regulation or imposes massive liability without the requisite clarity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.552" offset="6752170">But the whole reason you have to have some limit is because it's presumptively quite broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.271" offset="6767008">And if -- I mean, for those who look at legislative history, the evolution of this provision, it was changed twice in the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.075" offset="6794279">And it started out that Congress was going to have a permissible use just for use in litigation involving motor vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.848" offset="6825313">Then they dropped motor vehicles and just said use in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.483" offset="6839837">And then in the final iteration, they said use in connection with litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.851" offset="6853316">So clearly they were trying to broaden it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.601" offset="6860317">Now, I would be the first to admit that there has to be some limit, and we certainly wouldn't say, for example, that if lawyers, you know, decide in this case, well, you know, we got this DMV information for perfectly legitimate purposes involved in a litigation, but now we are sitting on a gold mine, so we should try to sell these same people floor mats or wiper blades or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.495" offset="6935968">I mean, of course they can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.862" offset="6941401">So there are limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3523.884" offset="14201456">And I think -- and there are loads of ways to find class representatives without going to DMVs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.619" offset="14216399">And, in fact, that's what most class action lawyers have to do is advertise in one fashion or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.856" offset="14233326">So that's not, to my mind, in Congress's conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.808" offset="14245133">But I would just point out that according to Respondents, the phrase survey research is surplusage, and this Court says that's -- you're not supposed to reach that conclusion if you can avoid it and you can avoid it by understanding it to be the meaning -- the meaning -- its effect is to override the consent requirement so that you can do commercial bulk surveys in (b)(2), which would otherwise require consent as a consequence of (b)(12).</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.923" offset="14341682">And then there is the so-called junior varsity harmonization basis for reaching solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.475" offset="14359863">And I would point out that Respondents are saying, it can't be that some -- certain statements in a letter means you crossed the line into solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.767" offset="14396957">Now, that has all kinds of massive civil liability consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.151" offset="14414511">Congress used the word l solicitation in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.170" offset="14426632">Congress meant to draw some kind of line around solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.872" offset="14441470">Now, admittedly, we're saying that the harmonization means that that's the same line you would draw in (b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.192" offset="14466756">But it's not inconceivable to think that Congress was -- was drawing a line at solicitation and that liability would flow depending upon whether somebody crossed it or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3598.565" offset="14500193">But, Mr. Guerra, it didn't draw the line at solicitation in (b)(4) and the advantage of Mr. Clement's argument is that the line that he sets up actually has a textual basis in (b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.606" offset="14540317">Because it focuses on words like what is a litigation and what is a proceeding and are we there yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.177" offset="14566648">And that seems to be what the language of (b)(4) indicates.</text>

            <text syncTime="3618.545" offset="14580128">Your Honor, our point is, sort of if you step back, and this is the question for the harmonization purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.633" offset="14608444">(B)(4) covers solicitation only because of the indeterminacy of the phrase in connection with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.889" offset="14641463">Without that language, there's no basis for saying (b)(4) is authorizing lawyers' solicitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.006" offset="14657972">So it is, I would submit, at the periphery of the authorization that (b)(4) provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.827" offset="14673228">(B)(12) solicitation is at the core of what that provision is about and that -- the -- the mass marketing of using DMV information is one of the fundamental problems Congress was addressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.468" offset="14727772">And I just think it's implausible to conclude that the -- that the periphery concept in (b)(4) should take precedence over the core function of (b)(12).</text>
