            <text syncTime="31.019" offset="232595">Because if we start with the statute, which always seems to be where you're pointing us to, and we're only looking for a clear waiver of sovereign immunity, then there will never be another Tucker Act action in the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="61.139" offset="353072">One would be that the statute does not contain its own remedial mechanism, and the second would be that the substantive obligations in the statute run against the United States, and the United States alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.096" offset="392883">And an example of that type of statute is the one that this Court found to be supported by the Tucker Act in White Mountain Apache Tribe or in Mitchell II.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.266" offset="425588">Those are the kinds of statutes as to which I think the Tucker Act was meant to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="89.808" offset="467697">We should have really just been briefing the issue of whether the statute at issue here waives sovereign immunity--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>

            <label>Mr. Sri Srinivasan</label>
            <text syncTime="99.497" offset="506463">--It does when they're dealing with the statute like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.699" offset="515345">And, of course, the reason that we are addressing Tucker Act immunity is because Tucker Act immunity is the basis for jurisdiction in this case according to the reasoning of the Federal circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.035" offset="544706">And the problem with the reasoning of the Federal circuit is it allows the litigant to readily circumvent the Court's strict test for sovereign immunity waivers by the straight forward device of adding the Tucker Act as a jurisdictional basis in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.279" offset="597578">And it's not at all clear why a plaintiff couldn't do that for any claim under any statute, including a statute as to which this Court would have already concluded that the unequivocal expression test, the standard test applied for waivers of sovereign immunity, was not satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.289" offset="653689">Now, to give the Court a concrete example of this, in Lane v. Pena, the court concluded that for Rehabilitation Act claims under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, there was no unequivocal expression of an intent to waive sovereign immunity by Congress for purposes of the damages claims; and, therefore, a damages claim can't be brought against the United States under Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.452" offset="734355">But under the Federal circuit's approach, there is no apparent reason why a plaintiff couldn't bring a damages claim against the United States for a violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by adding the Tucker Act to the jurisdictional bases in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.093" offset="788899">Because if the plaintiff were able to do that, notwithstanding this Court's decision in Lane v. Pena, the result would be that the plaintiff could say, the Federal circuit, you should look at the statute and ask the question whether it can be fairly interpreted to mandate the payment of money by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.702" offset="847309">There is no unequivocal expression of an intent to waive sovereign immunity, but that doesn't detract from the ability of the Federal circuit to conclude that the statute, nonetheless, can be fairly interpreted to mandate the payment of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.843" offset="891926">Now, of course, if that issue were to arise, we would make the argument that the statute can't be so read.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.379" offset="910003">But the possibility that a plaintiff could make that argument, notwithstanding this Court's decision in Lane v. Pena, we think reinforces the need to conclude -- to conclude that the Tucker Act can't be applied in the way that the Federal circuit sought to apply it here.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.949" offset="1124311">And so you wouldn't look to the Tucker Act as the basis for the waiver of sovereign immunity, and you would look at FLSA in the way that we think you should look at FCRA -- excuse me, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.388" offset="1166107">Now, Your Honor is correct that there is a body of court of claims jurisprudence that doesn't necessarily view the statute in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.459" offset="1194319">But if you apply the framework that we think is the correct one to apply, as we set forth in our brief, you might reach the same conclusion under the Fair Labor Standards Act, although under a slightly different route.</text>

            <text syncTime="339.186" offset="1465262">Here, 1681(p), which is set forth at 13(a) and 14(a) of the appendix to the government's brief, speaks specifically about actions being brought under FCRA in any appropriate United States District Court, and then only, it goes on to talk about, or in any other court of competent jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.315" offset="1949781">--We're certainly relying on that, Justice Scalia, when you're asking whether the Tucker Act can be used as the basis for waiving sovereign immunity for claims under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.921" offset="1984158">So when you bring the Fair Credit Reporting Act into play, yes, we're absolutely relying on the specific versus the general proposition, as this Court has relied on in any number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.860" offset="2019998">I guess I understood Justice Kagan's question to be talking about the Tucker Act and the Tucker Act alone, without bringing into play any other statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.799" offset="2047688">Now, I take Your Honor's point that it's hard to conceive of the Tucker Act in that kind of isolated fashion, because usually you'll be asking a question whether a claim can be brought against the United States under some other statutory regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.090" offset="2092827">And so if that statutory regime includes its own remedial mechanism, as FCRA does, it's hard to avoid resort to the specific control as a general proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.946" offset="2128249">But the other point about construing the text of the Tucker Act alone is that the Tucker Act is a waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.683" offset="2155208">So the canon that we construe waivers of sovereign immunity strictly comes into play when we construe the terms of the Tucker Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.103" offset="2184883">And I think it stands to reason that when you apply that canon, you wouldn't read the Tucker Act to encompass fully any act of Congress, because the implications for waivers of sovereign immunity would be quite substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.661" offset="2227201">And so the Court has never construed the Tucker Act that way, and it shouldn't countenance that kind of construction now, which is effectively what the Federal Circuit's interpretation allows, because, rather than applying the strict standard under which Congress would have to be seen to have unequivocally expressed an intent to waive the Government's sovereign immunity in the terms of FCRA, it allows a plaintiff to avoid that by simply resorting to the Tucker Act in the jurisdictional basis of a complaint, and getting the real act by the Federal Circuit's own description standard that applies to the Tucker Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="590.552" offset="2470767">First, on the question of whether the United States is subject to the substantive obligations in FCRA, I don't know that's there's a one size fits all answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.623" offset="2498979">I think you'd have to go provision by provision and make an assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.574" offset="2510786">And the reason I would say that is that, with respect to certain provisions at least, there are other statutes that, depending on the provision, have a specific obligation against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.680" offset="2547253">And I'm thinking in particular of the Debt Collection Improvements Act, the Privacy Act in certain contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.084" offset="2564808">As so you have -- you have to ask the question whether, with respect to the particular FCRA provision that's alleged to run against the United States, would the better basis for finding the United States' obligations be some other statute that speaks more specifically to the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.475" offset="2614440">So I'm resisting the notion that FCRA's references to person in all of its substantive obligations would necessarily encompass the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.212" offset="2645369">Now, there's at least one provision as to which we don't deny that the Government is covered, and that's 1681b(b), and that provision is set forth at pages -- at page 7a of the appendix to the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.138" offset="2697092">And with respect to the particular provision at issue in this case, the truncation provision, I guess we don't have to confront the question of whether the government is bound by that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.511" offset="2734604">It might well be, but we don't have to confront that question, because the Government acts as if it's in compliance with that provision because it has to.</text>

            <text syncTime="731.142" offset="3033131">But that's not at all atypical under this Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence, and it's not at all atypical for Congress to have fashioned a scheme that runs in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.231" offset="3065418">And the Privacy Act at least is one example, where in the Privacy Act, which applies to the Government and the Government alone, there are certain obligations that the Government has to comply with in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.687" offset="3103244">But Congress is very careful to cabin the circumstances in which the Government would be subject to liability and money damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.215" offset="14177386">And I think, because of the ambiguity in the courts to which the FLSA refers, for the reasons I was discussing with Justice Sotomayor earlier, I think you could see that statute as incorporating the Tucker Act itself, but that would be something that Congress did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.743" offset="14251469">I think there's several answers to u(i).</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.295" offset="14257738">First of all, I'm not sure which way that cuts because the fact -- it may be u(l), it may be u(i), but you -- I'm not sure which way that cuts because, on one hand, the fact that Congress specifically provided for the United States to be liable in certain situations I think cuts in favor of our understanding, not against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.340" offset="14329836">But there's a more fundamental point about the argument that my friend makes on the other side, which is that that statute was enacted, I think, before the civil remedies provisions were expanded to encompass all persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.231" offset="14377484">So it's hard to conclude that that notwithstanding any other provision would have referred to something that came along later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.683" offset="14391276">Now, I have two points that I'd like to make in rebuttal, one of which, there's been some questions today about which is the specific statute and which is the general statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.436" offset="14422310">Now, one, I think, clear indication that the specific statute for present purposes should be FCRA is to look at what the Plaintiffs allege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.692" offset="14451253">The Plaintiffs are bringing a FCRA claim, and there's no mistake about that, because the Plaintiffs seek the FCRA advantage of statutory damages of at least $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.715" offset="14483332">And so they're grounding their claim in the FCRA cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.834" offset="14495870">And I think, therefore, you should look at FCRA to determine whether the government is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.702" offset="14511335">And you don't have a situation in which you can mix and match under both; you should look to FCRA to determine whether there's been a clear and express waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.540" offset="14538711">The other point I would like to discuss is something that -- references something Justice Breyer was adverting to earlier, which is even if there was some universe in which you could contemplate a hybridization where you apply the Tucker Act, even though there's a cause of action already in the statute, you wouldn't do so in the context of this case because there are clear indications that Congress wouldn't have contemplated a resort to the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.638" offset="14627110">The Tucker Act doesn't apply to torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.705" offset="14635364">This claim is a tort claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.357" offset="14641947">We know this because the Court in Safeco a few terms ago -- this is at 551 U.S. 69 -- specifically referred to the Restatement of Torts as a means of interpreting the term willfulness, which is the linchpin for the claim here.</text>
