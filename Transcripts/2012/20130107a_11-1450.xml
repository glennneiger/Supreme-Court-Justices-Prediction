            <text syncTime="10.689" offset="148105">Congress enacted the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, CAFA, to expand Federal diversity jurisdiction and to protect defendants and absent class members against the kind of State court class action abuses that are occurring in Miller County, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.583" offset="215606">Congress directed that in calculating the amount in controversy,</text>
            <text syncTime="31.702" offset="232115">"courts shall aggregate the claims of the individual class members. "</text>
            <text syncTime="35.923" offset="249042">That's 28 U.S.C. Section 1332(d)(6), quoted in full at page 2 of our blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.410" offset="274956">Congress's express focus on the claims of the individual class members in the text of the statute, rather than on the amount being sought by the would-be class representative, is dispositive of the question presented and requires reversal in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="57.770" offset="336396">Would your position be the same if the issue were not the amount sought but rather the substantive claims?</text>
            <text syncTime="63.906" offset="360951">Say there are two different claims the class member -- the class could raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.608" offset="375789">One would yield damages of $4,900,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="74.798" offset="404523">Do you have the same objection in a case in which the prospective representative only pleads the first claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="83.787" offset="440468">We are not arguing that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.037" offset="445483">There are cases that this Court has decided going back to Barry v. Edmunds in 1886 where there are allegations in a complaint that might, for example, yield a punitive damage claim but it's not explicitly pled, and the courts then look and say: Punitive damages could be recovered here and say the amount in controversy clearly exceeds the -- the necessary amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.750" offset="528344">But we're not saying that in every case the courts need to look through and see every claim that could be in play.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.208" offset="570140">You make the point in your briefs about the statute of limitations question.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.493" offset="587276">In other words, it's not just how much they claim, but where they decide to cut off the statute of limitations and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.349" offset="614757">It seems to me that it's a bit of a slippery slope if you start saying we're going to look at what the class could recover in deciding whether or not, not simply whether or not this representative is adequate, but whether or not it's below or above, above or below $5 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.012" offset="701379">Under the traditional diversity statute, the courts look and see what's the maximum amount the plaintiff on his or her best day could recover based on the factual allegations in the complaint and the causes of action that could arise from the factual allegations--</text>

            <text syncTime="194.458" offset="883191">It's much different when Mr. Knowles has come to court and said: I want to represent these other individuals in Arkansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.975" offset="1185167">My point is that much of your argument in your brief is centered around binding the absent class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.195" offset="1210140">What I'm getting to is that if the stipulation is grossly unfair, there may not be a class at all, or the Plaintiffs who have claims greater than those in the aggregate might opt -- will get notice and opt out.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.472" offset="1275237">And there is due process challenges if a settlement is entered that is so grossly unfair that it violates due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.374" offset="13682773">They explain what has been happening in Miller County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.593" offset="13695730">It's not speedy justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.643" offset="13699909">It takes five or six years to get a hearing on anything and then there's no hearing, even on class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.563" offset="13719553">And that's why, Justice Kagan, it's cold cold comfort to maybe somebody day the Court will find this is an inadequate class member or class representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.502" offset="13755289">It does not solve the problem that Congress sought to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.537" offset="13767514">With respect to Mr. Fredrick's suggestion that this stipulation is binding in this case forever and all-time on anybody who's in the case, his own brief on page 41 says: It might well be that another class representative might get appointed and the stipulation might be invalidated because it's an unfair stipulation and not valid for the class.</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.935" offset="13957059">And it may very well be that there is a significant one, I don't know, but when you look at CAFA, I mean, CAFA did a lot of things.</text>

            <text syncTime="3483.247" offset="14038352">And this is a kind of a jerry-rigged solution to get at a problem that Congress, in fact, did not address.</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.918" offset="14064997">First, Congress knew what was going on in state courts and wanted swift removal in a simple way for defendants to protect defendants and absent class members because it knew what was going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3504.345" offset="14122675">This Court said -- one of the reasons is speedy motion to dismiss, and a strong standard is necessary as to avoid discovery that is burdensome, that coerces settlements that don't relate to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.320" offset="14170636">So Congress knew it was bringing cases into the federal system for precisely that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.372" offset="14190802">And on this master of complaint point, Mr. Frederick is simply incorrect on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.758" offset="14212327">St. Paul wasn't a master of the complaint case, it said the plaintiff can limit the amount that he wants to seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.662" offset="14231971">The master of the complaint doctrine has never, ever been applied by this Court where an unappointed named plaintiff, who's not been appointed to represent people, seeks to try to alter the claims and judgments of other people and the rights of them to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.422" offset="14294979">It's usually been applied in the arising under contexts.</text>
