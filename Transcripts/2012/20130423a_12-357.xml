            <text syncTime="8.437" offset="139642">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.456" offset="151763">The crime of extortion under the Hobbs Act, like the related crimes of larceny, burglary and embezzlement, is at bottom a property crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.978" offset="185826">Accordingly, understanding the scope of obtainable property under the Hobbs Act is critical to deciding the scope of the basic criminal prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.983" offset="221875">The Government has offered you a definition of property that only a prosecutor could love: Any intangible right with economic value, but that definition is fundamentally incompatible with this Court's precedence and with Congress's conscious decision in the Hobbs Act to criminalize the State -- New York State crime of extortion, but not the New York crime of coercion.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="52.516" offset="316020">If the jury had -- had returned the verdict which is at JA142, and it had marked that the attempt to extort was to extort the commitment, you might still maybe have some causation arguments, but I assume the property argument you're about to make is just irrelevant.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="72.512" offset="395955">Well, I don't think it's irrelevant, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.464" offset="403792">I would have a different argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.698" offset="408703">I think that I would stand first and foremost on this Court's decision in Cleveland, where it recognized that something like, I think the commitment, certainly the video poker license was at issue there, the Court also referenced an unissued patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.474" offset="463874">And it recognized that there are things that have value once they're issued, but in the hands of the Government, they don't have value, and therefore don't qualify as property.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="97.830" stopTime="110.387">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="97.830" offset="497310">Could -- could the case have been indicted -- has it been charged as one in which what they were taking was the commissions that would ultimately have been generated?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="110.387" stopTime="159.404">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="110.387" offset="547465">Well, Justice Kennedy, it might have been possible to say that what was obtained here was money, but I think if the Government had prosecuted it under that theory, it would have to prove that somehow the Government paid too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.462" offset="599815">I don't think it can point just to the commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.397" offset="607547">And I would analogize it to the McNally case.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.016" offset="617996">In the McNally case, you know, there was this scheme in which various sort of friends of government officials were getting the commissions from a workmen's compensation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.539" offset="656135">And what this Court said is, well, it would have been one thing if the Government had come in and said that the Government paid commissions that were too high, or the Government had received inferior quality insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.262" offset="702946">But what the Government did there instead was sort of take the shortcut and plead that what had happened is, the Government had been deprived of its interest in having the honest services--</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="159.404" stopTime="174.414">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="159.404" offset="743593">Well, here, what the Petitioner wanted were the commissions, ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.689" offset="756654">And you can't commit extortion in order to get -- and that's real money.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.058" offset="778179">It's for the Government to answer, not you, but can -- do you have any idea why they didn't charge that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="174.414" stopTime="196.793">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="174.414" offset="803570">--Well, I think the reason that they didn't charge that is probably practically twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.632" offset="820497">One is that a commitment under New York law and practice is not quite as what it sounds; it's not really a commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.137" offset="850486">And the best evidence of that is with the last fund for this particular management company, they got a commitment from the State and there was no ultimate investment made.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.077" offset="886221">So there's a subsequent step down the road.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="196.793" stopTime="197.610">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="197.243" offset="894894">I see.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="197.610" offset="896357">So I think that's part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.029" offset="898029">The other thing I would say is as in McNally, I think they would have had to prove that the management fees were somehow excessive or something like that, so they didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.718" offset="936794">They focused on this recommendation.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="213.955" offset="961767">--Mr. Clement, just along the same lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.591" offset="972321">What you're saying is that it still would not be extortion -- let's say somebody in your client's position runs an investment company, wants an investment, wants the fees that come along with that investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.048" offset="1018087">Goes to -- let's say that there's a single person who gets to decide whether to make that investment, and so to pay those fees, goes to that person, threatens that person with something terrible happening to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.189" offset="1066675">You're saying that that does not count as extortion, that there's a reason that the Government didn't charge it like that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="246.343" stopTime="266.089">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="246.343" offset="1091335">I would say that that -- I would say a couple of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.878" offset="1105441">I would say that's a harder case than the one I have before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.497" offset="1115890">I would say that I don't think that's actually extortion if what they charge is the commitment, not the money that goes -- that flows from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.270" offset="1155074">And then what I would say -- and the reason I would say that is because of Cleveland.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="266.089" stopTime="272.077">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="266.089" offset="1170329">Well, they want the investment with -- and the fees that come with the investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.375" offset="1183495">So -- and that's why they're threatening the person.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="272.077" stopTime="289.955">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="272.077" offset="1194257">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.510" offset="1196034">And I would say that under McNally, in that kind of case, what the Government has to prove is that if they want to make the property the money interest that the Government is paying out and the person is obtaining, they have to show that there's some sort of excessive commission or excessive sort of management fee.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="289.955" stopTime="298.478">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="289.955" offset="1265728">Even -- even though they wouldn't have gotten the investment and they wouldn't have gotten the fees absent the -- the threat of force or -- or violence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="298.478" stopTime="359.799">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="298.478" offset="1299896">Again, that would be my position.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.645" offset="1308569">And I think it would follow from this Court's decisions in cases like Cleveland and McNally, because in McNally, of course, the people who were part of that fraudulent scheme, they were getting commissions from the workmen comp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.468" offset="1355798">And the Government's theory was that just interfering with the Government's decision about who to give the workmen -- where to place the workmen's comp policies was enough of an interference to support a fraud conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.843" offset="1401356">And this Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.212" offset="1406789">And one of the things it then said is well, it would be different if -- if the Government went in and proved that the commissions that were paid were too high, or that the Government somehow got inadequate insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.686" offset="1456736">But if all they're doing is saying that what's going on here is sort of the interest of the Government in having its employees serve them honestly and in their best interest, and not in some third party's best interest, that brings you squarely into honest services.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.529" offset="1512011">And nobody's saying that doing that's a good thing, but it's -- it's the traditional office of the State law crime of coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.933" offset="1541686">It's--</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="359.799" stopTime="386.084">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="359.799" offset="1545134">But it's -- the coercion crime, at least under New York's definition, requires force.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.455" offset="1571779">And -- and here, it's a threat of exposure of an embarrassing fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.359" offset="1599364">So, what -- am I right about that, that the coercion, which is not a Federal crime but is a State crime, requires a threat of force to restrict him of his freedom?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="386.084" stopTime="448.776">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="386.084" offset="1650251">--I don't believe that's correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.202" offset="1658714">This was charged by New York State authorities as coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.689" offset="1676687">So the very crime that Congress didn't incorporate into the Hobbs Act, the New York crime of coercion, was charged here, and it's my understanding that the New York crime of coercion, like the earlier version of coercion in the racketeer -- in the Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, like the traditional model penal code definition of coercion -- it's the -- the threat part of it is the same as extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.870" offset="1765398">So it covers a threat to a person or to property.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.888" offset="1777519">And it's been interpreted certainly to include threats to disclose information like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.059" offset="1802179">So I think the real difference between the crime of extortion and the crime of coercion, both as a general matter and under New York law, is whether or not property is obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.449" offset="1851707">And that's ultimately what's so problematic about the Government's definition here, because their definition is essentially the property includes the autonomy interest of a business to operate free from coercion.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.811" offset="1913147">In your reply brief, you begin by saying that you're -- you are not arguing that the property has to be tangible and includes some forms of intangible property.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="463.536" offset="1960063">I would say that for property to come within the terms of the Hobbs Act prohibition on obtaining property, it has to be alienable, transferable, moveable.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.808" offset="2005203">That's the critical thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.843" offset="2009278">So the distinction is not between alienable and inalienable.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.462" offset="2023802">A patent is an inalienable -- I mean, rather, a patent is an intangible property right, but it's transferable, it's obtainable, it is sellable, and so it has the characteristics of things that I think come within the traditional definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="771.619" offset="3192416">Property generally means value of some sort and you don't use any of those words in your definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.309" offset="3227211">So, what you're using in my mind, and not illogically, is to say that the second part of the statute has to do some work, so it has to mean that you're taking something of value away from someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.020" offset="3302025">That makes logical sense to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.459" offset="3943802">Because extortion is one of the classic common law property crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.994" offset="3961878">The definition of property for purposes of extortion ought to be the same as the definition of property for larceny, embezzlement, burglary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.623" offset="5572484">There's -- there's no Federal crime and that's the result of a very deliberative decision by Congress in 1946 in enacting the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.043" offset="5602159">Of course, they had in front of them the model of the Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934 that prohibited both coercion and extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.632" offset="5632461">Congress made a conscious decision to, in the Hobbs Act, prohibit robbery and extortion, but not pick up the prohibition on coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.822" offset="5665271">And so there isn't a Federal crime directly on point, but it's a very conscious decision by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.559" offset="5688154">And, of course, the New York crime on point is exquisitely on point, because not only is there a coercion offense under New York statute, but it is an aggravated offense if the victim is a government official discharging their public duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.986" offset="5749908">And so this is really a situation where the State courts have a crime that directly fits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.657" offset="5884595">What happened is there were some pretrial rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.175" offset="5894626">And one of the pretrial rulings gave the defendant an opportunity to do some discovery on the State government to figure out whether this was really done in the discharge of public duties or maybe this was sort of a political thing that was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.084" offset="5946244">And once that State law discovery happened into the government of Albany, all of a sudden the State prosecution didn't seem like such a great idea anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.988" offset="5977905">And the Federal prosecutors are just down the street, so they were very happy to lateral it to the Federal prosecutors and have them take it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.194" offset="6006744">And because the Federal offense doesn't have an element of interfering with the public duty, they didn't have to worry about the discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.832" offset="6029314">And that is just a very concrete illustration of the problem of over-federalizing crime, because this -- we're talking -- this is the opposite of the typical public corruption case where you think, well, maybe there are people in the State government who aren't going to -- State prosecutors won't be willing to prosecute one of the bigs in the State government, so we need the Federal Government to step in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.043" offset="6106114">The one thing a State doesn't need extra incentive to do is to protect the integrity of its internal deliberative process from coercion or extortion, for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.149" offset="6142580">But the -- the real cost then to having these duplicative Federal crimes, and they were front and center in this case -- if I may reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.699" offset="11964752">And the Court said that the right of women to access the services of the clinic was really more of a liberty interest and the running of a business was really more of -- it didn't say it was property because it didn't have to decide that, but it said that's really more in the nature of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3180.523" offset="12828047">It's true that that wasn't the property being extorted in those cases, but that's what they said property means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.760" offset="12848945">And if you are worried that those things can't be obtained, you don't need to worry -- you don't need to have a special definition of property to take care of that, because the Hobbs Act already requires that property be obtained before there is extortion, so there is no need to have a redundancy built in for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.667" offset="12900563">Again, I can understand how -- how the main Hobbs Act, sort of heartland cases which involve the co-opting of a brick and mortar businesses, seem like easier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.257" offset="12939015">And you might want to draw a line between the running of a business and the doing of labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.292" offset="12951136">But a person has a property interest in doing their job the same way that they have a property interest in running a business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3240.061" offset="13066179">A couple of points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.411" offset="13071612">Ms. Harrington started by pointing to the language in McNally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.965" offset="13085823">And she is absolutely correct that at the same time that McNally got rid of the honest services prosecution that was brought there, they reserved two possible prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.886" offset="13117483">One would be the obtaining of money, where there was a difference in what the government paid for and what the government got.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.940" offset="13141725">The other thing that she alludes to is there -- the Court did say, well, maybe there's a possibility that you could prosecute based on the government's loss of control over its allocation of these workman's comp policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.282" offset="13191044">The problem is, of course, that McNally precedes Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.817" offset="13205255">And in Cleveland, the government seized on that language and said, well, even if the video poker license isn't property, the right to control who gets it is property, and that got exactly zero votes from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.209" offset="13250812">So I think that argument is no longer viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.792" offset="13261157">Ms. Harrington also points to these New York cases about the scope of property for purposes of 851 of the New York Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.148" offset="13290518">But of course, what we're talking about is 850 of the New York Penal Code, the kind of property that can be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.719" offset="13312775">I think it's common ground that -- they are not co-extensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.587" offset="13324269">There are -- there is property that you can obtain that you can't threaten.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.956" offset="13337748">Indeed, the classic thing you obtained in -- in an extortion case is money, and I'm not sure how you really threaten money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.776" offset="13365020">You can threaten to take money from someone, but you don't really threaten the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.994" offset="13377872">So these are different terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.680" offset="13384664">So relying on the Barondess case, which is the same case that Justice Stevens relied on in dissent in Scheidler II just doesn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.369" offset="13415384">Now, she's also absolutely correct that extortion at common law only involved official extortion, but that doesn't mean that there aren't common law places to look for a relevant definition of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.344" offset="13463345">Because the same basic concept was in the larceny statutes, the -- not statutes, the common law crime of burglary, larceny, and embezzlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.466" offset="13503782">And indeed to this very day, New York refers to extortion as larceny by extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.619" offset="13528442">And if you go to those New York cases, the place I would point you to is the Ashworth case, which is cited in both of our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.857" offset="13553415">This is a case that makes very clear that under New York law, they didn't even think that services at all were property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.946" offset="13581732">This is a case where the foreman of a mill gets the bright idea that he's going to do some work for his own company using the mill's facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.850" offset="13613392">And he's charged with larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.885" offset="13621438">And the court in that case says: No, that's not larceny, you didn't obtain any goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.789" offset="13641082">Classic sort of common law property is in order to be the kind of property that you can steal or extort it has to be moveable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.017" offset="13714016">And they use a line which I think really captures what's going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.452" offset="13727704">They say, well, maybe you can conceive of such a conception of property, but they say to conceive this requires a certain intellectual flexibility which is probably not possessed by the average person.</text>

            <text syncTime="3476.615" offset="14012438">I went back to the Tropiano case, because it is sort of the pro genitor of this whole line of Second Circuit cases, and I noticed two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.119" offset="14038456">One, I noticed it was written by a district court sitting by designation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3504.568" offset="14124243">So the -- the difference is, Your Honor, that that could have also been, I think, actually prosecuted as a property crime, because in that case, there were customer accounts that were obtained, and those customer accounts, as the facts of Tropiano discussed it, actually had value; they could have been transferred from one business to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.113" offset="14194355">So I think what would happen in the Second Circuit, if you decide this case the way we would like you to, is the Government's going to have to be careful.</text>
