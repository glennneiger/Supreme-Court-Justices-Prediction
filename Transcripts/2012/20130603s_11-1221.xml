            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Sotomayor has our opinion this morning in case 11-1221, Hillman versus Maretta.</text>

            <text syncTime="6.644" offset="133036">The Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Act of 1954 FEGLIA establishes a life insurance program for federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.609" offset="172847">FEGLIA provides an employee, may appoint a beneficiary to receive insurance proceeds after his death. This case turns on the relationship between FEGLIA and a Virginia statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.729" offset="225405">Section 20-111.1(A) of the Virginia Code, Section A revokes a beneficiary designation in any contract that provides a death benefit to a former spouse when there has been a change in the decedent's marital status.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.466" offset="296354">In the event that this provision is preempted by federal law, a different provision, Section 20-111.1(D) of the Virginia Code, Section D creates a cause of action rendering a former spouse liable for the proceeds to whoever could have received them if Section 8 were not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.383" offset="387992">This case presents a -- the question whether Section D is itself preempted by FEGLIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.867" offset="417876">Warren Hillman and respondent Judy Maretta were married.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.412" offset="436057">In 1996, Warren named Maretta as a beneficiary of his FEGLIA policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.001" offset="462493">Warren and Maretta divorced in 1998 and Warren subsequently married petitioner Jacqueline Hillman.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.924" offset="494153">Warren died in 2008.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.578" offset="504707">At that time, Warren had never changed his beneficiary designation and Maretta collected the proceeds of his life insurance as the named beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.516" offset="548488">Hillman, then, brought an action in Virginia Circuit Court arguing that Maretta was liable to her under Section D for the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.462" offset="584328">Maretta argued in response that Section D is preempted by federal law and that she should keep the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.966" offset="614316">The Virginia Court rejected that argument and found her liable to Hillman for the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.943" offset="638245">The Virginia Supreme Court in turn reversed holding that Section D is preempted by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.281" offset="667606">We granted certiorari and now affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.117" offset="682862">Under our precedents, state law is preempted when it stands as an impediment to Congress' purposes and objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.272" offset="715567">In ascertaining Congress' purposes here, we do not write on a clean slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.148" offset="739077">In two previous cases, we found that federal statutes similar to FEGLIA preempted laws -- rules of state law requiring that insurance proceeds be paid to a person other than a named beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.631" offset="800935">In Wissner versus Wissner, we considered whether the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 preempted as rule of state marital property law.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.729" offset="845343">There, a California court granted a decedent's widow who was not the named beneficiary an interest in the insurance proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.462" offset="880243">We reverse holding that the federal statute preempted the state law action.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.025" offset="902499">We explained that Congress had made clear that the proceeds paid under the federal statute belonged to the named beneficiary and no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.525" offset="944504">And we found that the California trust conflicted with that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.261" offset="963521">Then in Ridgway versus Ridgway, we considered a similar question regarding the federal Servicemen's Group Life Insurance, SEGLIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.002" offset="1002496">A Maine court imposed a constructive trust on insurance proceeds paid to a named beneficiary, an order that they be transferred to the decedent's first wife under the terms of a divorce decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.445" offset="1056204">We found the trust preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.897" offset="1066026">We reasoned that the statute was similar to the one we considered in Wissner in a critical respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.529" offset="1092566">Both statutes reflect that Congress' purpose in requiring that the proceeds belong to a named beneficiary and that she be able to use them.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.812" offset="1133735">And we concluded that the Maine trust conflicted with that purpose by taking the proceeds from the named beneficiary and reallocating them to someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.933" offset="1178143">The same reasoning applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.485" offset="1188383">The statutes we considered in Ridgway and Wissner are similar to FEGLIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.614" offset="1208863">Like these statutes, FEGLIA plainly gives highest priority to a named beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.414" offset="1236135">And FEGLIA includes an order of precedents nearly identical to the one Congress enacted in SEGLIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.235" offset="1267378">FEGLIA accordingly reflects Congress' clear purpose that the proceeds should actually belong to the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.694" offset="1301232">As in Ridgway and Wissner, Section D conflicts with that purpose by allocating the proceeds to another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.354" offset="1331848">We, therefore, hold that Section D is preempted by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.627" offset="1348984">The judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.738" offset="1361418">Justice Thomas and Justice Alito have filed opinions concurring in the judgment.</text>
