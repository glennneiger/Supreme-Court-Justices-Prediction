            <text syncTime="306.845" offset="1334035">Well, do you mean to say that a judge who has just ruled that a statement is immaterial is going to keep the case in his court litigated by an individual plaintiff, even though he's just ruled that the statement is immaterial?</text>

            <text syncTime="326.989" offset="1414597">But let me take one more run at -- at your premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.960" offset="1426509">The next thing that would happen if I'm right, presumably, and the case isn't over, the class just isn't certified, is that defendant, you know, emboldened by the judge's rule, will file a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that materiality -- the element of the substantive offense, not materiality, the predicate to class certification -- has just been determined in favor of me.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.341" offset="1532043">That is a very different question for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.793" offset="1541865">Materiality, as this Court has said, is fact-sensitive, and it involves a balancing of credibility of witnesses or of expert opinions, and the judge at the -- at the class cert stage has to find facts and has to make a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.137" offset="1603201">When it comes up on summary judgment, what the -- if there is a dispute of material facts, what the judge should do under the law is to say: Look, I just held that I didn't think it was material, but I resolved disputed material facts, and that's for the jury, and this case will go to the jury.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="393.116" offset="1679060">So you're saying that a judge on a class certification stage can say: This is immaterial, the statement is immaterial; therefore, this can't proceed as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.639" offset="1721170">But when a summary judgment motion comes in arguing the exact same thing, the judge will say: Oh, it's not immaterial after all, or it's disputed enough that the case can continue?</text>

            <text syncTime="428.890" offset="1822211">But the vast majority of cases -- this is a perfect example -- where they have statements that in the abstract, extracted from the total mix of information, look pretty material.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.295" offset="6431779">First, Basic did not try to distinguish between the requisites of Rule 23 and the substantive component of the fraud-on-the-market theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.135" offset="6471171">And that's important, because in that case the court remanded for a redetermination of materiality, but it upheld the class certification order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.026" offset="6514744">So in the context of Basic, the court seemed to be thinking there was a difference between what needed to be proved for class certification and what would need to be proved on the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.000" offset="6562600">Now, the second thing to be said is that Basic needs to be read against the backdrop of Rule 23, and especially this Court's recent decision in Walmart v. Dukes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.391" offset="6608262">Because materiality always generates a common answer for all class members, it is the quintessential common issue that does not splinter the class or cause it to be noncohesive for purposes of understanding predominance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.151" offset="6779207">In a fraud-on-the-market case, the idea of reliance, the only theory of reliance that is being advanced, is indirect reliance on the integrity of the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.680" offset="6841379">Why do we know that in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.680" offset="6849320">For two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.881" offset="6854127">First, the Connecticut Retirement System could not be the class representative if it did not meet the typicality requirement of Rule 23(a), which the district court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.606" offset="6901042">This is on page 25A of the petition appendix, and has not been challenged subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.093" offset="6922985">But why doesn't Connecticut have a direct reliance theory?</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.212" offset="6943465">We know they don't because they have a fiduciary duty to their investors to apply whatever theory they have of securities fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.353" offset="6988082">So we know in this case, and this is by far clear in the run-of-the-mine fraud-on-the-market case, that the class representative will only establish reliance indirectly by showing that the integrity of the market was impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.314" offset="7051926">And so their construct is an entirely hypothetical and theoretical one.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.665" offset="10497268">In 2011 the statistics showed that what Congress did was successful in achieving the purpose Congress attained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.066" offset="11946959">And my second response is Basic didn't adopt any particular economic model of market efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.803" offset="11969842">If you look at footnote 24 of Basic, if you look at footnote 28 of Basic, the Court makes very clear that it's not adopting an economic theory as far as how quickly or completely the information is incorporated into the market price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.194" offset="12019371">Instead, it was looking at congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.563" offset="12028879">It was looking at difficulties in direct proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.813" offset="12037865">And it was looking at common sense to reach a result and again to adapt a reliance theory that was premised on face-to-face transactions to the impersonal market that exists today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.120" offset="12079139">And so, again, I wouldn't consider market efficiency in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.005" offset="12094708">It's not presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.122" offset="12099096">To the extent there's questions about how the determinations should be made in terms of levels of generality, that's something that the lower courts can decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.511" offset="12124696">Today, all we're talking about is the materiality component and again focusing on whether or not common issues predominate over individual issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.998" offset="12154685">It's a comparative inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.534" offset="12160745">It requires comparing common issues on the one hand and individual issues on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.252" offset="12179658">And Petitioners have not identified any individual issues that will actually come into play as the case is litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.508" offset="12208706">The -- going to the -- some of the policy concerns that were raised, I'd make a couple points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.460" offset="12228455">One is the one that my colleague made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.995" offset="12234620">Congress addressed those policy concerns in the PSLRA, in SLUSA, and it chose to address them through different means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.148" offset="12263250">The second point I would make is the same argument could be made with respect to the other elements of the securities fraud cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.069" offset="12290940">If the argument is you should have to prove it at class certification because otherwise the case is going to settle, you could say the same thing with respect to scienter, with respect to falsity, with respect to loss causation, which this Court in Erica John of course did said did not have to be proven at the class certification stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.514" offset="12352693">So in short, it proves too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.281" offset="12359798">The third response is that there are countervailing policy concerns and there are countervailing concerns that are actually tethered to Rule 23 in terms of efficiency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3153.357" offset="12720079">And this Court made it very clear in Shady Grove that the only question at the Rule 23 stage is whether the prerequisites have been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.426" offset="12748396">The only one that we're talking about here is predominance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.878" offset="12758114">It's a comparative inquiry between common issues and individual issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.747" offset="12773682">And if I can quickly go back to my point about countervailing policy concerns, as Petitioners acknowledge, a determination of the class certification stage is not binding on anybody -- in that case on the ultimate fact-finder, or in any other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.340" offset="12828017">And so the problem with Petitioners' position is that it would require relitigation of the materiality question at the merits stage to the extent the class is certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.511" offset="12860722">Or if it's not in every other case that is brought on the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.148" offset="12875247">That doesn't serve the efficiency purposes that underlie Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.434" offset="12892383">The -- in terms of absent class members, he suggests that absent class members would somehow be prejudiced, but as Your Honor, Justice Kagan, pointed out, the only prejudice is that they wouldn't be able to relitigate the very same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.443" offset="12944419">That is protected by allowing opt out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.395" offset="12956226">That is protected by Rule 23's adequacy of representation requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.263" offset="12971691">And so that's already sufficiently protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.465" offset="12980468">The most efficient course is to actually focus on common issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.667" offset="12993320">Materiality is a common issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.834" offset="13001993">It will result in the same answer for all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.286" offset="13011815">The class rises or falls together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.588" offset="13021010">And class certification is not about only certifying meritorious cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.225" offset="13039505">In 1966, when the current version of Rule 23(b)(3) was adopted, it was an innovation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.295" offset="13063851">It was a change from the spurious class actions where it was a one-way ratchet, where only the defendant was bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.532" offset="13088824">In the current rule of Rule 23(b)(3), you want to certify class actions that are both meritorious and those that are not, so it reaches a binding judgment.</text>
