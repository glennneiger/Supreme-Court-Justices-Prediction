            <text syncTime="10.389" offset="148000">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.391" offset="160017">The court of appeals' practice of automatically granting appellate relief for every violation of Rule 11(c)(1), irrespective whether it prejudiced the defendant, is flawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="200977">As this Court recognized in United States v. Vaughn, Rule 11(h) was adopted for the precise purpose of ending the then-common practice of automatically reversing even for non-prejudicial Rule 11 errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.339" offset="251863">It would be especially inappropriate to apply an automatic reversal rule in a case like this one that comes to the appellate courts in a plain error posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.160" offset="283106">Erroneous judicial participation--</text>

            <text syncTime="46.095" offset="290838">May -- may I ask you a question about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="48.481" offset="300347">It's plain error because the defendant didn't make an objection in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.253" offset="331485">But the defendant doesn't know about Rule 11 and doesn't know about 11(c) that says a judge is not supposed to participate in plea bargaining, and his lawyer doesn't tell him the judge is doing something wrong because his lawyer wants him to plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.881" offset="405986">So he lacks the information necessary to make a prompt objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.702" offset="429287">So it seems a bit unfair to say that he's subjected to plain error when he hasn't got a clue that the judge, magistrate wasn't supposed to do what he did.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric J. Feigin</label>
            <text syncTime="94.628" offset="484980">--Well, first of all, Your Honor, I'd respectfully disagree with the notion that just because Respondent's counsel was advising him to plead guilty, that Respondent's counsel had so advocated -- so abdicated his representation that he couldn't be expected to object to an error that the judge made.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.221" offset="547360">I'd also point out that if the Court were to create an exception to the plain error doctrine, this would be a particularly inappropriate case in which to do it because not only was there not a contemporaneous objection, there wasn't an objection before the district judge in the months and proceedings that followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.695" offset="601277">They didn't raise any claim of error on appeal until the court of appeals raised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.533" offset="620608">And in fact, in this case, Respondent did file a motion in the district court to withdraw his plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.503" offset="644431">And he didn't mention the magistrate's comments or any pressure he felt from those comments at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.074" offset="662717">Well, suppose you just stick with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, or perhaps not even a hypothetical, what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.227" offset="687377">Just assume that the defense attorney likes this judicial intervention and he -- he wants this to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.750" offset="721440">It -- it seems quite unfair to talk about the plain error, because he doesn't tell -- as Justice Ginsburg says, what does the defendant know about Rule 11(c)?</text>
            <text syncTime="164.439" offset="764177">He doesn't know about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.391" offset="768043">Well, Your Honor, if Respondent wants to make an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on collateral review, he can make that.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.712" offset="797300">But I'm not aware of any court of appeals that has abandoned the plain error doctrine in this kind of case and I don't think there should be any sort of special exception that says when -- that we assume when counsel is advising his client to plead guilty, that we can't expect counsel to make objections to errors that occur based on the judge's comments.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.243" offset="891445">So he didn't -- even at that stage, the lawyer, the -- I don't want to absorb your time beyond this, but I think the plain error is questionable when it seems that the judge, the lawyer, they arranged against the -- the defendant, and the defendant doesn't know that he has this route.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.693" offset="989248">Well, Your Honor, let me just say one other word about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.895" offset="1001996">I don't think it's going to be easy for courts of appeals to tell exactly why the lawyer may not have made an objection, and I just don't think it's fair to assume that in every Rule 11(c)(1) case that the lawyer is effectively acting at contrary purposes to his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.622" offset="1072944">I mean, lawyers advise clients to plead guilty all the time and that doesn't mean that they've abandoned the representation to the point where you can't assume they're acting on the client's behalf and will raise objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.664" offset="1113173">But our basic point in this--</text>

            <text syncTime="253.949" offset="1122263">Does this issue go -- it doesn't go to whether you should apply the prejudice prong, because either under normal harmless error or plain error you have to get to whether it prejudices someone.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.606" offset="1172941">That was exactly the next sentence that was going to come out of my mouth is that our basic point in this case is that you have to apply prejudice analysis in some form, and whether it's harmless error or plain error, the court of appeals refuses to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.231" offset="1219439">And we think--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="278.881" offset="1221947">One of the most powerful arguments of your adversary is that in the most common of situations -- and it's how I read the advisory notes -- it's going to be awfully difficult to say that a judge's intervention hasn't influenced a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.209" offset="1295298">This is the unusual case where you might actually have a no prejudice argument because of the unique facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.863" offset="1321943">But there is a purpose for keeping judges out of this, and that's because the subtle influence that judges exert is not so subtle.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.337" offset="1363844">It's very palpable and does influence most decision making, both by lawyers and defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.676" offset="1397176">So if that's the standard, why isn't it a rebuttable presumption that prejudice exists?</text>

            <text syncTime="341.472" offset="1472304">There's actually a variety of different kinds of Rule 11(c)(1) errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.857" offset="1485888">Rule 11(c)(1) has been held to cover, for example, a judge pressuring the government outside the defendant's presence to offer a plea, a judge discouraging a plea, a judge commenting in a well-intentioned manner about the obvious difference in potential sentencing consequences between a potential plea agreement and a trial, or a judge, having rejected one plea agreement that the parties reached, indicating a bit too strongly what kind of plea agreement the judge might accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.841" offset="1589855">I think adopting some sort of “ one size fits all ” rule would -- would be inappropriate, and the rebuttable presumption I think would also be inappropriate, for a few reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.180" offset="1623187">First of all, I don't think courts should have to distinguish between different types of errors to see whether a rebuttable presumption should apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.010" offset="1706466">--I think that's already built into Rule 52 in a couple of different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.628" offset="1720990">First of all, Rule 52 places a presumption based on whether or not the defendant objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.199" offset="1739276">If the defendant objected, the burden's on the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.651" offset="1753068">If the defendant didn't object, the burden is on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.686" offset="1761218">But also, I don't -- I want to be clear on this: The type of error -- if there is a very serious error, the nature of the error and the error's seriousness would of course be a factor, and a very important factor, in the prejudice analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.161" offset="1815135">But, as Your Honor has recognized with this case, there may be other circumstances that indicate that the error did not in this case have a reasonable probability of affecting the decision of the plea.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="437.551" offset="1856722">But that's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.151" offset="1859021">Is there a way of doing this, which I -- I don't see at the moment?</text>
            <text syncTime="443.289" offset="1879605">But the judge intervenes in a serious way and says, you go listen to your lawyer and this is a very harsh penalty and, boy, you are into -- okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="453.395" offset="1920043">A serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.930" offset="1926208">And now to track down whether that affected substantial rights, you have to try to track down the state of mind of the defendant and would he have pled guilty anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.453" offset="1960271">And that's sometimes quite difficult to do, very hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.821" offset="1977721">But if you don't insist on doing it, and you have an absolute rule of structural error or something, then you suddenly discover these minor things.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.395" offset="2020040">The judge says, go to lunch, or -- or, you know, some really trivial intervention, and you are going to say that -- the guilty plea, he can just void his guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.151" offset="2055044">So there should be a way of distinguishing the trivial from the -- from the really important in terms of how serious the intervention was, but I don't see any way to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.340" offset="2091824">Have -- have you thought about that at all?</text>

            <text syncTime="500.709" offset="2109274">I have thought about that a little bit, Your Honor, and I'd say that trying to break Rule 11(c)(1) into different pieces and adopt different rules based on different kinds of error would be inappropriate, for three main reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.516" offset="2156503">The first one is I think it would be inconsistent with this Court's position in Neder v. the United States, which makes clear that in deciding whether an error is structural you have to look at the entire class of errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.972" offset="2194329">And Rule 11(c)(1) defines the class of errors as cases in which a judge participates in plea negotiations in some way, and it doesn't define subcategories.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.645" offset="2229019">Second, I think breaking this up into pieces would essentially be an incomplete and unsatisfactory form of prejudice analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.417" offset="2264128">That is, reviewing courts would still be looking at errors and differentiating between them in order to decide whether relief is warranted, but they would be narrowly focused only on the binary inquiry of how to categorize the error, they'd be disregarding how serious that particular error was versus other errors in that category, and they would be disregarding all the other facts and circumstances the courts always look at and are well familiar with how to look at in a normal prejudice analysis, to determine whether the error affected the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.401" offset="2368095">Third, particularly because the subcategories don't exist in the rule and would be something of judicial invention, I think that approach would be inherently inadministrable and manipulatable and lead to inconsistent results.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.828" offset="2421803">It could be very difficult to tell whether a particular type of error should fall into one category or another, and under the approach you're suggesting, which I think is the approach Respondent is advocating -- I don't think Respondent is actually advocating the per se rule that the Eleventh Circuit adopted here -- I think under that approach, you know, everything turns on a narrow question of categorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.657" offset="2505081">I think the much better approach, and the approach that Rule 52 adopts, is to look at all the facts and circumstances to attempt to determine the effect on the outcome.</text>

            <text syncTime="658.780" offset="2741542">The Fourth Circuit's decision in United States v. Bradley, the judge essentially told the defendants that he -- it boggled his mind that they were going to trial and kept essentially harassing them about why they were going to trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="678.574" offset="2820745">But the advantage of a prejudice approach is it allows you to separate that kind of case from kinds of cases when there are less serious errors, or even a case where there is a fairly serious error -- and this case may fall within that category -- but there are facts and circumstances that indicate that the error didn't have a reasonable probability of affecting the defendant's decision to plead.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.450" offset="3580281">--So -- Your Honor, I think one of our main concerns in bringing this case before the Court is the interaction of this Court's decisions in Lafler and Frye with Rule 11(c)(1), and Frye suggests that one way a judge can try to guard against a later claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is to conduct a colloquy with the defendant -- not a colloquy, but a discussion with the defendant -- during the initial proceedings to try to establish that he understands the consequences of his plea and that he's receiving effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.486" offset="3704415">I think that could be done very carefully by asking very general questions, but I think it's very easy to see how a judge might slip up and say, oh, that's an interesting offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.175" offset="3739210">Did you discuss that with your counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="909.777" offset="3745584">That seems like something you ought to discuss with your counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.894" offset="3754048">And I think what the automatic reversal rule the court of appeals has adopted is it really puts judges, and, frankly, the government, in kind of a box.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.965" offset="3782365">On the one hand, judges have to guard against these later ineffective assistance of counsel claims by discussing plea discussions, and on the other hand, any slipup in that discussion is going to lead to automatic reversal on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.773" offset="3829594">Now, I -- I just want to add one -- one more thing, which is, I think, the best evidence that we have that this -- the magistrate judge's comments here did not create a reasonable probability of effecting the defendant's decision to plead is, again, defendant himself moved pro se to withdraw his plea in the district court, and his reasons for withdrawing his plea, which start on page 58 of the Joint Appendix, never mention the magistrate's comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.424" offset="3932203">Instead, in his own words, what he says is,</text>
            <text syncTime="958.440" offset="3940249">"Your Honor, my decision to enter the plea was a strategic decision. "</text>
            <text syncTime="962.059" offset="3954668">"The reason being is that I knew that the prosecutor had a duty with the courts to disclose the information relevant for this court's determination of the acceptance or rejection of the plea. "</text>
            <text syncTime="971.434" offset="3992180">And what he means by that is that he took issue with some aspects of the allegations in the indictment, although he's quite clear, both in that proceeding and at his guilty plea proceeding, that he did commit the conspiracy offense, and he just believed that those allegations in the record would be cleaned up or have to be withdrawn by the prosecutor if he pleaded guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.646" offset="4069085">Now, he was wrong about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.181" offset="4075145">But what we have in this case is a clear unvarnished explanation by the defendant in his own words about why he pleaded that doesn't mention the magistrate's comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.536" offset="4112657">The Court of Appeals erred in disregarding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.488" offset="4124464">And if the Court has no more questions, I'll reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.014" offset="5618564">And so if a judge is making the kinds of comments that Rule 11(b) is contemplating, informing the defendant about the nature of the charges against him, attempting to make sure that the defendant understands that his trial right is a real one, telling the defendant a little bit about what, in fact, the -- the sentencing exposure might be if he is convicted, those purely informational statements we don't think is what is meant to be prohibited by the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.352" offset="7187896">Let me address that in two ways, because we have two separate arguments and I want to try to keep them distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.404" offset="7208062">One is that if you look at the text and the history of Rule 11, there is strong evidence that Congress actually made an affirmative judgment not to sweep in Rule 11 violations within the scope of Rule 11(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.564" offset="7268771">Our second argument is even if Rule 11(h) applies to all Rule 11 errors, that all Rule 11(h) does is apply the same substantial rights language that you see in Rule 52(a) and (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.589" offset="7328853">And this Court has recognized that, while that substantial rights language is often synonymous with a case of specific prejudice inquiry, that's not always true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.429" offset="7364170">And there are a number of examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.814" offset="7373679">The Court is familiar with the constitutional cases in which the Court has said that an error is structural without trying to determine, make a case-specific determination of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.920" offset="7410146">But there are a number of nonconstitutional cases as well in which the Court has said an individualized prejudice inquiry is simply inappropriate, that the error affects substantial rights by its nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.710" offset="7453300">So one example that I think is fairly close to the one we have here is Gomez v. United States, where you have the Court addressing a statutory provision that prevents magistrate judges from conducting the jury voir dire and that proviso is violated and the Court is asked to conduct a prejudice analysis: Did it matter that the magistrate judge conducted voir dire?</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.076" offset="7550789">And the Court said: We are not going to go there; this is in effect a structural defect in the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.352" offset="7803863">So the case in which the Court did so is the McCarthy case, which is discussed extensively in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.970" offset="7826329">The Court referred to the 1966 version of Rule 11 and said that prejudice adheres in a violation of that rule and that it was not going to conduct an individualized analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.612" offset="7872931">It was simply going to grant relief where there had not been full compliance with that provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.227" offset="7963419">In other words, if automatic reversal is always the effect of finding a violation -- and I think you acknowledge this in a way -- that people will just find fewer and fewer violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.118" offset="8006887">And I'm wondering why we should do something like that rather than interpret the rule as it was meant to be interpreted, but then say: You know, somebody can look and say it really just didn't matter that it was violated in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1994.163" offset="8083165">The rule really is about this problem of placing judicial pressure on defendants to plead guilty, and those are the cases that ought to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.935" offset="8114198">But the Court has a line-drawing decision to make either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.720" offset="8129349">Either the line that the Court should focus on is the line that separates participation from nonparticipation or, again, a narrower class of participation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.775" offset="8253587">Is it easier for them to monitor the narrowing, the improper narrowing of the rule over time, or is it easier for them to monitor improper applications of the harmless error rule, especially applications of it that are happening in this kind of setting, where it's going to be almost inherently a very speculative analysis, an attempt to read the defendant's mind and ascertain whether the defendant was influenced by what the judge was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.391" offset="8355987">And it would be much easier for appellate courts to focus on the line-drawing exercise that determines whether or not a violation had occurred or, if you think that the rule is broader, whether the kind of violation that occurred in this case occurred, than it would be to try to make this case-by-case scouring the record, individualized prejudice determinations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2127.063" offset="8614704">So there are -- there are certainly steps that a judge can take to help root out the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.586" offset="8640827">And I would say that the fact is that generally when it comes to ineffective assistance of counsel claims there is only so much that the trial could court can do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.985" offset="9866387">That is, some States even today allow a judge to participate in plea bargaining, and the advisors -- the rules advisory committee -- said, when it -- when it framed this rule that some commentators had said it was quite -- quite a frequent thing that happened, that judges participated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.821" offset="9973698">So it isn't like not having a public trial or not giving a person counsel of choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2487.133" offset="10054991">And -- and so this Court can resolve the case just on that narrower basis, that there is a category of cases that clearly do involve direct judicial pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.090" offset="10094802">And no State allows it, and those are clear violations of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.660" offset="10117058">So without needing to draw these other lines about how broad participation may reach, the Court can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.814" offset="10141718">But even in those States, it's important to note that -- that the Federal system has made a different structural choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.135" offset="10170975">So whether or not it may violate the Constitution for States to have carefully tailored procedures that allow some type of judicial involvement, that's not the structure that the Federal system has chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.709" offset="10217264">And when you're dealing with the structural choice that was made in Rule 11, that judges shall not, must not participate in plea discussions, that that is as elemental to the Federal system of plea bargaining that we have as many of the familiar elements of -- of the trial are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.237" offset="10283406">And so, the fact that States have made -- made different structural choices does not mean that it's not a structural error here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.946" offset="10434289">Now, if the Court feels like it may be difficult to do line drawing, and it is uncomfortable extending the rule, the remedy that we're seeking that far, it is entirely appropriate for the Court to -- to take out a subcategory of Rule 11(c)(1) violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2610.696" offset="10549228">It would factor into the prejudice analysis that the Court undertakes, but it also is a reason just to -- to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.052" offset="10582665">I mean, this Court in -- in various instances has indicated that -- I mean, there are some -- some broad rules out there: The right to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.641" offset="10617042">It comes in different shapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.041" offset="10622580">And the prejudice analysis that applies for a total denial of the right to counsel is different from the one that applies when you're dealing with mere deficiency in counsel's performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.264" offset="10655494">And there is -- and again, this is -- this is a comparative line-drawing problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.251" offset="10675452">Either you draw the line looking at what a violation is or looking at what a judicial exhortation is from the statement that is made, or you engage in this freewheeling speculation that the government wants engaged in, where you were trying to read the defendant's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.827" offset="10733757">And that is simply not how harmless error analysis normally proceeds, where you have a closed universe of a record, you have specific criteria that are being applied, and you can posit what a reasonable juror is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.485" offset="10780360">There is no reasonable defendant that can be posited in the same way, because defendants are idiosyncratic and are entitled to be idiosyncratic.</text>

            <text syncTime="2677.324" offset="10815782">Mr. Yablon, do you know of any case where there is one of these core violations, these exhortation cases, where the Court did not find prejudice?</text>

            <text syncTime="2685.447" offset="10848278">The answer is no, and that would be -- and we would urge the Court that if it does not accept our primary submission, that it make clear that judicial exhortations like this are highly unlikely to be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.689" offset="10913271">That is what the Fourth Circuit has done, the Fifth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Tenth Circuit, the D.C. Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.360" offset="10931870">They are in effect applying a per se analysis, they're just not calling it that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.212" offset="10947334">They are reversing in all of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.331" offset="10955798">And so, if this Court is uncomfortable calling it a per se rule, at least it should give very strong indications that comments like this cannot be written off, that they are highly likely, given the position of the judge relative to the defendant, to affect the defendant's thinking, to affect the way that the defense counsel approaches the case, and possibly the prosecution as well in those cases in which the prosecution is aware of the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.577" offset="11044823">And we would go further and say that if the Court were to go down this road, it would be useful for the Court to provide the additional guidance of holding that this particular type of error was not harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.302" offset="11087664">That would send a signal to the lower courts that this conduct is clearly off limits, and it would give them an indication that the court means what it's saying, that these kind of comments, where a judge is exhorting a defendant to come to the cross, that he needs to plead guilty--</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.343" offset="11239801">I mean, consider the change in judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.460" offset="11248265">The reason this hearing occurred before the magistrate judge is because the defendant sent a letter to the district court asking -- explaining his problems with his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.216" offset="11283374">He got a response from the magistrate judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.318" offset="11291733">So in the defendant's mind, the magistrate judge and the district court are effectively one and the same, and you would not want a system where district courts are encouraged to send these issues to magistrate judges, so magistrate judges can engage in these kind of comments, but then the district judge can basically just cleanse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.511" offset="11352546">It is going to affect the way that the process plays out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.962" offset="11366338">Now, the speedy trial issue, if I may just -- we can equally draw the inference that that was only done because counsel wanted to put some pressure on the government to actually reach a deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.604" offset="11412836">And it is that kind of speculation that makes this error ill-suited to the kind of remedial analysis the government favors.</text>
