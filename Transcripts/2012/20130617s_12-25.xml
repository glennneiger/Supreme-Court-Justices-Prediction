            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Kennedy has our opinion this morning in case 12-25, Maracich versus Spears.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="6.968" offset="134290">To obtain a driver's license or to register a vehicle, State Department of Motor Vehicles has a general rule, requiring an individual to disclose detailed personal information.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.935" offset="186222">This includes an individual's name, home address, and telephone number and in many states, including the state in this case, it includes the individual's Social Security number and medical information.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.372" offset="239929">Now, a federal statute has been enacted to protect the privacy of drivers who furnish this information to the State DMVs and the federal law, as the Diver's Privacy Protect Act or the DPPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.318" offset="299698">Disclosure of personal information from the state DMV databases is prohibited under this federal Act unless that disclosure falls within one of the Act's exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.616" offset="352883">The respondents here are South Carolina trial lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.974" offset="366362">They obtained names and addresses of over 34,000 individuals from the South Carolina DMV.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.187" offset="399172">They did this to send letters seeking plaintiffs for a lawsuit that they had filed against a group of South Carolina auto dealerships for violations of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.149" offset="447028">The petitioners here, who are the plaintiffs below, are South Carolina residents whose information was obtained and used without their consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.670" offset="489138">They sued the respondents, the state trial lawyers, for violating the federal act, the DPPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.574" offset="516723">Now, there are 14 subsections in the federal Act that contained exceptions to the general Non-disclosure rule and this case, requires the Court to interpret the exception that's contained in Subsection b (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="117.865" offset="577954">And it simplifies a bit for this summary, but the b (4) exception allows personal information to be disclosed for use in connection with any civil, administrative or arbitral proceeding and the statute specifies that this includes investigation in anticipation of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.968" offset="666352">And the respondents, the trial attorneys, argue here that both of these phrases or either of them, cover their use of DMV information.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.169" offset="707103">In light of the text and structure of the DPPA, the Court today holds that an attorney's solicitation of clients is not permissible under either of the phrases just noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.209" offset="755273">Solicitation is a distinct form of conduct, separate from the limited permissible purposes provided under b (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="169.936" offset="786202">It is separate from an attorney's duties as an officer of the court or as an agent of the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.457" offset="812220">The distinction between solicitation and other litigation activities is recognized by state bars, and state statutes, that treat solicitation as a discrete subject for regulation and governess of the legal profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.256" offset="883482">Interpreting b (4), not to include solicitation, is further supported by the fact that b (4) is one of only four of the 14 statutory exceptions that permits the use of the most sensitive kind of information, including medical and disability history and Social Security numbers, to permit this highly personal information, to be used in bulk solicitation would be so substantial and intrusion on privacy that it must not be assumed without a clear indication that Congress intended to provide attorneys with a special concession to gain access to this information for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.167" offset="1055159">Excluding solicitation from the reach of b (4) also respects the statutory design of the federal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.177" offset="1083162">The use of protected personal information for the purpose of bulk solicitation is addressed explicitly by the exception in b (12), and it has the specific safeguard requiring the express consent of the person contacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.523" offset="1140527">If the in connection with language of b (4) were read broadly to include solicitation and attorney could use protected information to send bulk solicitations, to perspective clients without their express consent, and this would create tension or significant tension in the DPPA between the litigation and the solicitation exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.647" offset="1225059">Now, the respondents contend that even if b (4) does not permit attorneys to solicit as a general matter, it should be allowed here when tied to a particular proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.346" offset="1263825">While some solicitations may have a close relationship to the existing proceeding, there is no principled way to classify some solicitations as acceptable and others as unacceptable for purposes of b (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="302.000" offset="1314398">In determining whether obtaining, using or disclosing the personal information is for the prohibited purpose of solicitation, the proper inquiry is whether the defendant had the predominant purpose to solicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.225" offset="1363299">That purpose might be evident from the communication itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.571" offset="1376778">In other instances, the defendant's whole course of conduct will be relevant in determining whether solicitation was the predominant purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.662" offset="1413141">There is a concern here about the amount of damages sought in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.191" offset="1435188">Recall that over, 34,000 individuals received communications from the respondents, under one view of the federal act's damages provision this would amount to $2500 per violation or sum in the neighborhood of $170 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.085" offset="1514809">Whether the civil damages provision in the act, Section 2724, whether that section, the damages section after a careful and proper interpretation would permit an award in this amount, and if so, whether principles of due process and other doctrines that protect against excessive awards would come into play is not an issue argued or presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.441" offset="1624210">In summary, solicitation of perspective clients is not a permissible use in connection with litigation or investigation and anticipation of litigation under b (4) of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.319" offset="1659737">As a result, the Court of Appeals erred in granting respondents summary judgment without first determining whether the communications had the predominant purpose of solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.111" offset="1698920">On remand, the Court of Appeals or the District Court must determine whether the letters sent by the trial attorneys, the respondents, viewed objectively had the predominant purpose of solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.642" offset="1748971">And in these further proceedings, other questions under the statute can be addressed including the argument that respondents conduct was permissible under the b (1) governmental function exception which neither this Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.817" offset="1809680">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Scalia, Sotomayor, and Kagan join.</text>
