            <text syncTime="50.183" offset="307253">Yes, I agree, Your Honor, but I thought it would be relevant to point out that it was pre-AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.901" offset="326061">And then, on that point, this Court has said several times that habeas should not be used to grant indefinite stays.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.006" offset="362528">In fact, even pre-AEDPA, in the Barefoot case, this Court said that habeas is not a time to retry a case, and even less is it a time to grant indefinite stays.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.631" offset="409026">So the sentence with, “ even less ”, followed the sentence with, “ not ”.</text>

            <text syncTime="101.999" offset="514456">We agree with the Ohio position.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.483" offset="520412">In the American Psychiatric brief, I think it's page 10, note 20, they said that up to 90 percent of the cases are solved in six to nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.173" offset="559178">And I think that if this Court set a standard of no more than a year for the successive stays, that would give some guidance to the courts.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="122.279" offset="595540">So how do you deal with Justice Kagan's earlier question of what difference does it make if the person's still necessary -- or the information, potential information is still necessary, what makes it unnecessary after a year?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Horne</label>
            <text syncTime="136.539" offset="652592">Because I think the consequence of AEDPA is that a balance has to be drawn between the fact that there has to be finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.276" offset="683625">In fact, this Court has said the purposes of AEDPA include finality, comity, federalism, and reduction of delays in death sentence cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.481" offset="716435">There needs to be a balance between that and the need to have a competent defendant, if we can have one, in a case where the testimony is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.737" offset="753424">This Court has said several times -- I was going to mention also the Heinze case, where this Court thinks that -- very clearly that stays cannot be indefinite.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.212" offset="791354">So I think it would be very helpful for this Court to give a guideline to the courts and say, the way to balance this is that if they get the time in which 90 percent of the cases are--</text>
