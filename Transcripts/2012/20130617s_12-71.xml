            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Scalia has our opinion this morning in case 12-71, Arizona versus the Intertribal Council of Arizona.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="8.543" offset="140664">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.018" offset="166473">The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires states to “accept and use,” that's the crucial language here, a uniform Federal Form to register voters for federal elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.052" offset="234600">The Federal Form developed by the Election Assistance Commission requires that an applicant aver under penalty of perjury that he is a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.427" offset="280158">The Federal Form does not require however any concrete evidence of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.574" offset="304713">Arizona law does.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.780" offset="313595">It requires voter registration officials to reject any application for registration including a Federal Form that is not accompanied by documentary evidence of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.769" offset="365526">The Ninth Circuit held that Arizona's requirement as applied to Federal Form applicants is preempted by the Federal Act's mandate and state's accept and use of the Federal Form.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.626" offset="420906">Arizona argues that accept and use requires only that a state “willingly receive” the Federal Form and use it in some way not that it be deemed conclusive of valid registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.272" offset="483495">That is certainly a possible meaning of accept, a merchant's notice that he will accept visa credit cards does not mean that he will not require in addition personal identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.436" offset="536158">But reading except merely to require willing receipt seems out of place in the context of an official mandate to accept something for a given purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.091" offset="582760">Imagine for example a government diktat that civil servants shall accept government IOUs for payment of salaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.958" offset="630303">That command certainly does not invite the response, “Sure, we'll accept IOUs if you pay us a 10% down payment in cash.”</text>
            <text syncTime="141.187" offset="671159">The implication of a mandate to accept is that that object is to be accepted as sufficient for the requirement it is meant to satisfy.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.491" offset="716403">Here, the requirement of registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.680" offset="729151">Many other federal statutes impose and accept requirement that obviously bears this meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.290" offset="759557">Arizona's reading is also difficult to reconcile with other provisions of the voting rights -- the Voting Registration Act as we explained in detail in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.062" offset="802712">In some, the Act forbids states to demand that an applicant submit additional information beyond that required by the Federal Form.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.355" offset="835835">We add an important caveat however the Act does not prevents states from denying registration based on any information in their possession establishing the applicant's ineligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.048" offset="898633">Arizona seeks to vindicate its reading of the statute by invoking the canon of construction that statutory ambiguities should be resolved in a fashion that avoids constitutional doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.919" offset="954117">The constitution, Arizona rightly points out, empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held but with a few exceptions not relevant here, does not permit Congress to regulate who may vote in federal elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.473" offset="1028305">Determining what qualifications of voter must possess is the province of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.924" offset="1054114">Arizona is correct that it would raise serious constitutional doubts if a federal statute prevented a state from obtaining the information necessary to enforce its voter qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.931" offset="1110120">But to avoid these doubts, it is not necessary to give accept and use a meaning that allows Arizona to deny the sufficiency of the Federal Form.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.209" offset="1147319">At oral argument, the United States expressed the view that one section of the statute requires the Election Assistance Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.464" offset="1180338">You remember them there that people that design the form, requires the Election Assistance Commission to include on the Federal Form information “Necessary to enable the appropriate state election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="287.018" offset="1254525">We need not consider whether the statute requires that.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.712" offset="1269258">It is enough that the executive has discretionary authority to apply it that way in order to avoid serious constitutional doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.914" offset="1306143">One further elaboration, the Voter Registration Act provides that any state may ask the Commission to include state specific instructions on the Federal Form, and the Commission has done that for some other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.285" offset="1367583">If the Commission rejects such a request or fails to act upon it, a state may seek judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.783" offset="1405618">That alternative means of enforcing its constitutional power to determine voting qualifications remains open to Arizona here.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.091" offset="1442816">If Arizona makes a request and the Commission does not approve it, Arizona would have the opportunity to establish in a reviewing court that requiring affirmance of citizenship on a mere affirmance of citizenship on pain of perjury will not suffice to effectuate its citizenship requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.998" offset="1522437">If that is so, the Commission would be under a nondiscretionary duty to include Arizona's concrete evidence requirement on the Federal Form.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.307" offset="1559636">The judgment of the Court of the Appeals is therefore affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.704" offset="1573219">Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.249" offset="1595476">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.462" offset="1608328">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
