            <text syncTime="9.856" offset="146895">In Grable, this Court explained that arising under jurisdiction demands not only a contested Federal issue, but a substantial one embedded in a State claim in order to indicate whether there is a serious Federal interest in exercising Federal jurisdiction over the State claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.602" offset="229860">This Court should reverse the judgment below because Minton -- Mr. Minton's claims do not present a substantial Federal issue, and exercising Federal jurisdiction over his claim and legal malpractice claims like his, State legal malpractice claims would--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="47.231" offset="296420">The question is whether the experimental use, whether that was a viable theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.770" offset="342500">Why isn't that a substantial -- what do you mean by “ substantial ”?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jane_webre" startTime="63.990" stopTime="131.051">
            <label>Ms. Jane Webre</label>
            <text syncTime="63.990" offset="363398">--Well, Your Honor, defining substantiality is a difficult point.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.775" offset="378549">I would answer in two layers.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.760" offset="386490">First, Mr. Minton's claim did not involve a legal question of does the -- how does the experimental use doctrine work; how is it applied, what are its parameters.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.202" offset="432256">The question was, did his fact-bound and situation-specific affidavit present relevant evidence of the application here in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.074" offset="471753">And it is not a substantial question because, first, from a unique case perspective, it involved merely a hypothetical determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.782" offset="510624">There were no actual patent rights that would be at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.182" offset="520132">Those were already fully, finally, irrevocably determined in the underlying patent litigation in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.721" offset="546359">And second, from a jurisprudence standpoint, the question of uniformity of patent law, any decision by a State court in Mr. Minton's legal malpractice claim would not be binding in any way on either the PTO in a patent application, or on any subsequent Federal court deciding a real patent case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="131.051" stopTime="135.955">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="131.051" offset="631623">You mean substantial beyond the -- this particular case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jane_webre" startTime="135.955" stopTime="317.872">
            <label>Ms. Jane Webre</label>
            <text syncTime="135.955" offset="651267">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.405" offset="661089">And I think that that's where the Federal circuit jurisdictional -- the Federal circuits “ arising under ” jurisdiction standard which the Supreme Court of Texas applied here, that's exactly where it goes awry, is that the court improperly conflates the question of necessity of a Federal issue with the question of whether that issue is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.504" offset="753458">And in the Grable case, this Court emphasized that those are two separate issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.158" offset="772057">There are four prongs to the Grable test: The Federal issue embedded in the State claim must be necessary to the State claim; actually disputed; substantial; and then there is a federalism inquiry that exercised a Federal jurisdiction over this State claim can't upend the proper balance between State and Federal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.137" offset="855962">The Grable court announced that, and then just a year later in the Empire Healthchoice case, Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg, you wrote that opinion for the Court, and that acted sort of as an underscoring of</text>
            <text syncTime="200.545" offset="909670">"and here's how limited the Grable rule really is. "</text>
            <text syncTime="204.683" offset="926180">The Empire Healthchoice opinion distinguishes between Grable, which presented a merely pure question of law, and the claims at issue in Empire Healthchoice which were fact-bound and situation-specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.241" offset="980410">It distinguished the -- the question of whether a State court is competent to apply Federal law to the extent relevant to the claims and found that, yes, it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.131" offset="1023982">And the Court emphasized that certainly the State courts are going to be deciding the occasional Federal issue here and there, but let's not make a Federal case out of each and every State tort claim that might have an embedded Federal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.641" offset="1081974">Now, in the earlier argument, there was some discussion of the fact that jurisdiction means a lot of different things in a lot of different contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.795" offset="1110604">But here, this Court has on more than one occasion determined that jurisdiction, “ arising under ” jurisdiction, means the same thing in 1331, the general Federal question jurisdictional grant, and 1338(a), the -- the exclusive provision that's applicable specifically to patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.225" offset="1188344">Now, that has been amended slightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.993" offset="1195450">It now includes compulsory counterclaims where they didn't used to be a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.695" offset="1214258">But the jurisdictional grant that Congress gave through the first sentence of 1338(a) uses the same exact phrase, the “ arising under ”,</text>
            <text syncTime="287.420" offset="1257099">"any civil action arising under Federal law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="290.455" offset="1269220">And Justice Scalia, you wrote the opinion for the Court in the Holmes Group case and explained that the linguistic consistency between those two means that they mean the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.513" offset="1313523">There is nothing unique about this subject matter, the patent subject matter, that changes the scope of the jurisdictional grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.916" offset="1339123">To be sure, the grant of original jurisdiction to the district courts is exclusive and that is different from the general Federal question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="317.872" stopTime="339.118">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="317.872" offset="1378934">Well, why isn't that significant?</text>
            <text syncTime="319.538" offset="1385621">Doesn't that manifest Congress's view that this is a complicated specialty area, and so there would be arguably a special reason for having these cases, cases that involve a patent issue, in Federal court rather than State court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jane_webre" startTime="339.118" stopTime="608.141">
            <label>Ms. Jane Webre</label>
            <text syncTime="339.118" offset="1463884">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.135" offset="1467959">But the Congress did that in a couple of different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.237" offset="1480393">First of all, I think it begs the question, it begs the core question, to say that exclusive -- the fact that jurisdiction is exclusive answers the substantiality, because in order to get to exclusivity of the jurisdiction you have to get to jurisdiction first.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.330" offset="1536818">You have to -- it has to be arising under an act of Congress relating to patents before it can then be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.167" offset="1560119">So -- so we still have the first step.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.000" offset="1567433">But also, Congress did not cast a net broader than the general “ arising under ” standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.189" offset="1596168">Even under the statutory framework after the America Invents Act amendment, under the statutory structure there are still a number of patent issues, legal issues that are going to be decided in the State courts, that do not come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.632" offset="1661997">For example, compulsory counterclaims now come within the exclusive jurisdiction, but permissive counterclaims don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.971" offset="1691358">Permissive counterclaims can certainly present just as substantive a question of patent law, and yet those are excluded under the statutory scheme of 1338(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="405.760" offset="1730542">Patent issues raised as a defensive matter are not sufficient to support “ arising under ” jurisdiction under 1338(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="413.766" offset="1762516">So certainly, Congress contemplated a situation where some patent issues are just not going to come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.306" offset="1804625">And I think it's interesting to back up a little bit and look at the Federal Circuit's evolved perception of its own exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.911" offset="1843078">In the early years of the Federal Circuit in 1984, the first Chief Justice -- the first chief judge of the court, Chief Judge Markey, in the Atari case that is cited at page 21 of the amicus brief filed by the American Intellectual Property Lawyers Association, the Federal Circuit wrote,</text>
            <text syncTime="453.075" offset="1919773">"Congress was not concerned that an occasional patent law decision of a regional circuit court or of a State court would defeat its goal of increased uniformity in the national law of patents. "</text>
            <text syncTime="464.199" offset="1964286">That was the view of the Federal Circuit's own jurisdiction in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.519" offset="1985497">But in the time evolved, the Federal Circuit has changed its perception of its own jurisdiction and that's why we are here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.440" offset="2013187">In 2007, the Federal Circuit went awry and -- and changed the standard that no longer follows what this Court articulated in Grable.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.779" offset="2054565">They have improperly conflated the necessity and substantiality components of the -- of an appropriate Grable analysis, and they totally disregard a proper balance of the State and Federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.956" offset="2103257">The Federal Circuit announced that there's an interest in -- Federal interest in uniformity of patent law, and then that was that.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.109" offset="2131887">That was the end of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.342" offset="2136798">There is no balance if you don't look at the State interest on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.929" offset="2151218">And in legal malpractice cases in general and in Mr. Minton's claim in particular, there are substantial State interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.702" offset="2186222">There is the general interest, the right of a State to develop its own State claims, its own State law and its own State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.706" offset="2218300">But there is also a State interest in governing the relationship between attorney and client that happens through the legal malpractice process.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.795" offset="2250588">But specifically with regard to Mr. Minton's claim, one of his primary theories in this case, in the legal malpractice case, is that the attorney's error with regard to bringing up the experimental use doctrine deprived him of the opportunity to make a lucrative settlement with the NASD in the underlying patent litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.792" offset="2330627">Well, the question of exactly how you prove whether and to what extent the NASD would have paid a settlement and for how much in the underlying case is a matter of tremendous dispute right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.016" offset="2383499">That is an evolving issue in the -- in the legal malpractice jurisprudence of the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.170" offset="2408158">In fact, in the month of December 2012, the Supreme Court of Texas heard argument in a case called Elizondo v. Krist that addresses that precise issue: How do you prove that NASDAQ would have paid him $100 million if only these lawyers had raised this issue earlier?</text>
            <text syncTime="591.548" offset="2473673">And yet, if Mr. Minton's claims are hailed into Federal court because of the fact-bound and situation-specific application of the experimental law doctrine, the Federal courts would be -- to that important issue that the State courts really need to resolve.</text>

            <text syncTime="686.324" offset="2852762">I mean, they are not going to mess up Texas law in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.834" offset="2910754">In a way, it's akin to the issue in Grable, because the -- the embedded issue in Grable that justified this Court reaching down and grabbing a State law claim and bringing it up into Federal court wasn't just that the issue was disputed, the construction of that statute was unresolved; but that it needed resolving.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.532" offset="3001556">It needed resolving by a court whose decision could be precedential so then it's resolved from then on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.206" offset="4684260">So the PTO would have made a -- its own determination and granted or not granted limited sanction, whatever action it is the PTO takes in -- before -- in a proceeding before itself, the PTO would be deciding that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.418" offset="4757089">So, in -- in the first instance, the PTO gets to decide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.220" offset="4772344">From a res judicata standpoint, the PTO's patent review manual, the Manual of Examination of Patents provides that res judicata effect is only given to decisions by either the Board of Patent Review or Interferences, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and the Federal circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.902" offset="4859071">No State courts make that list.</text>

            <text syncTime="2816.634" offset="11374010">I think there are -- there are distinctions in the area of patent law versus any other area of the law mainly because as we get to the State -- this goes to the analysis of the State/Federal balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.740" offset="11418418">That's why the exclusive Federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.942" offset="11427195">That's why exclusive nationwide jurisdiction in patent law in the Federal Circuit is different than any other area of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.365" offset="11456870">It is that balancing test that we are required to engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.483" offset="11469409">That's why it's unique from antitrust, trademark, civil rights, securities, employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.803" offset="11490620">Those have concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.553" offset="11497621">They may not have an agency involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.422" offset="11505144">For example, bankruptcy initially sounds like it's exclusively Federal court issues, but when you look underneath the bankruptcy, there is core proceedings and there's non-core.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.778" offset="11538581">Non-core are concurrent; those could be heard in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.345" offset="11548821">Secondly, those underlying issues in bankruptcy typically involve State property right issues anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.884" offset="11574944">So they are really applying whether somebody has a perfected security interest lien, whether somebody has a justified debt, whether -- things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.721" offset="11606291">So rather than in any other area of law, these other areas, even if they are exclusive in Federal court jurisdiction, some of those underlying issues are basically based on who the party is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.921" offset="12871140">One is they conflated necessity with substantiality and that comes, in the Federal circuit's jurisprudence, that comes from a sound bite from the earlier Christiansen case where the -- the -- the line goes something like, there is a substantial Federal issue because it is necessary to the parties' claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.718" offset="12946372">And so it conflates necessity with substantiality, and the -- the Texas Supreme Court followed the Federal circuit's construct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.638" offset="12978033">They said, We're applying Grable, we're looking at substantiality, but then they did exactly what the Federal circuit did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3226.161" offset="13012096">They pointed to the needs of Federal interest in the uniformity of patent law and that was the end of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.232" offset="13036338">And I think that that is a measure of the deference that the Supreme Court of Texas, as other State courts would do, the deference they grant to the Federal circuit in deciding the question of appropriate scope of patent jurisprudence and the relative importance of the -- the uniformity of patent law.</text>
