            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Thomas has our opinion this morning, case 11-1175, Marx versus General Revenue Corporation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clarence_thomas" startTime="8.274" stopTime="289.032">
            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="8.274" offset="139515">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.031" offset="162607">The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act prohibits certain debt collection practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.288" offset="187580">Olivea Marx filed a lawsuit against General Revenue Corporation, alleging that it violated the Act by harrassing and threatening her in order to collect the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.770" offset="233556">The District Court ruled against Marx and awarded respondent, General Revenue Corporation, cost pursuant to Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.575" offset="280785">This rule gives the courts the discretion to award cost to the prevailing party, unless a federal statute provides otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.947" offset="314222">Marx, moved to vacate the award arguing that section 1692k(a)(3) of the FDCPA provides otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.409" offset="356122">That section provides that “On a finding by the court that an action under this section was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment, the court may award the defendant attorney's fees reasonable in relation to the work expended and costs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="80.826" offset="429787">That's a sentence crying out for editing.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.425" offset="448178">Marx argued that this provision means that a court may award cost to the defendant, only on a finding that the action was brought in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.272" offset="495512">In her view, because she brought the case in good faith, the respondent was not entitled to cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.249" offset="523410">The District Court rejected Marx's interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.775" offset="541592">The Tenth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.137" offset="550996">It agreed with the District Court that costs were allowed under Rule 54(d) even in the absence of bad faith because nothing in The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act displaced the judge's discretion under that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.957" offset="614316">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.132" offset="630930">Rule 54(d) gives courts discretion to award cost to prevailing parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.178" offset="655172">That discretion can be displaced by a federal statute that “Provides otherwise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="143.608" offset="680876">A statute provides otherwise if it is contrary to the Rule 54(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="149.098" offset="702819">The language and context of section 1692k(a)(3) persuade us that it is not contrary to Rule 54(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="158.814" offset="741689">Section 1692k(a)(3) provides that when a plaintiff brings an action in bad faith, the court may award attorney's fees and costs to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.237" offset="783381">The best reading of the statute is that Congress intended it to deter plaintiffs from bringing lawsuits in bad faith, but it does not address whether cost may be awarded in this -- in a case such as this, where the plaintiff brought the case in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.125" offset="850986">Marx argue that by specifying that a Court may award attorney's fees and cost when an action is brought in bad faith, Congress intended to preclude a Court from awarding fees and costs when bad faith and purpose of harassment are absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.339" offset="923815">We are not persuaded by that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.876" offset="933951">The statute provides that when the plaintiff brings an action in bad faith, the Court may award attorney's fees to the defendant, but a court has inherent power to award attorney's fees based on a litigant's bad faith even without section 1692k(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="224.627" offset="1005004">The fact that Section 1692k(a)(3) codifies the background rules for attorney's fees, weighs against inferring congressional intent to override the background rule with respect to cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.102" offset="1058816">We note that Congress has expressly limited court's discretion to award cost in other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.875" offset="1085983">Had Congress intended section 1692k(a)(3) to displace the rule, it would have -- it could have easily done so by saying that the court may award cost to the defendant only on a finding that the action was brought in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.039" offset="1158604">For these reasons and reasons setup more fully in our opinion, we conclude that section 1692k(a)(3) does not provide otherwise, than Rule 54(d) and that the District Court had discretion to award cost without finding that the plaintiff brought the action in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.139" offset="1238956">Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Kagan joins.</text>
