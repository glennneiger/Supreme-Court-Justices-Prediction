            <text syncTime="10.706" offset="149736">Congress intentionally designed FEGLIA so that the Federal interest ends once the insurance proceeds are paid out.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.048" offset="427157">And that is a mechanism to help do that, but it wasn't--</text>

            <text syncTime="128.029" offset="619104">It -- Congress did this in several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.816" offset="634256">If you wanted to do a beneficiary designation, you have to do it before -- in order for it to be honored, it's got to be filed before death.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.503" offset="664976">The same thing with an assignment.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.055" offset="679186">These are all examples of Congress saying we don't want States interfering with the administration of FEGLIA plans, but I don't think it is a statement that Congress is saying we don't want States to regulate domestic relations when it comes to FEGLI benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.086" offset="751284">The -- the intent of Congress with regard to FEGLI benefits needs to be gained from a review of the entire statute of FEGLIA.</text>

            <text syncTime="192.121" offset="875418">The outcome in that case was the preemption prevailed in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.859" offset="898406">I -- I was citing the -- the case of Hisquierdo because I think it very well lays out the presumption against preemption of family law.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.231" offset="935918">And -- and while that presumption can be overcome, as it was in Ridgway, and as it was in Hisquierdo, it -- it still is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.336" offset="972280">And it's -- it's a statement that Congress generally is not looking to regulate divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.974" offset="990879">Not that Congress can't do it when it wants to, but that this Court normally starts its analysis assuming that Congress didn't intend to do that, unless they find direct -- a direct enactment saying this is -- we want to preempt all other State laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.252" offset="1059947">That -- that was the -- the purpose behind citing Hisquierdo.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="243.588" offset="1081263">But, you know, the -- the exception suggests another thing besides the fact that it suggests that the only way the second spouse prevails is by a divorce decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.528" offset="1125044">It also suggests that Congress's sole purpose -- that Congress did not have the sole purpose in this statute to make it easy for the insurance company that has to pay out the proceeds to know whom the -- who the beneficiary will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.875" offset="1206442">If that were the case, there wouldn't be this exception for a divorce decree, because the insurance company is going to have to look to see if there's a divorce decree on the books, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.567" offset="1249178">That obviously shows that Congress in this statute not only had a concern about efficiency of payment, but also had a concern about who gets the payment, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.807" offset="1302154">There's no other way to explain the -- the exception for divorce decrees.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.611" offset="1321380">--Well, the exception for divorce decrees I would analogize to the Rose case, when this case was -- when this Court was addressing veterans' benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.882" offset="1354504">And in the Rose case, this Court distinguished Ridgway and Wissner, because the purpose behind the Veterans' Benefits Statute this Court determined was in part to take care of the veterans' families and it looked at -- it looked at the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.694" offset="1425766">It looked at the Senate report that said that, but it also looked at the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.797" offset="1438096">And the text had in Rose a -- a provision which said the Veterans Administration can apportion a part of those benefits for the benefit of the noncustodial children.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.888" offset="1494520">And it was argued in that case that that's Congress's statement that this is the only exception and further exceptions shouldn't be applied and Congress was trying to regulate this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.610" offset="1541436">But this Court said that's not what Congress was doing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.581" offset="1557318">That was Congress showing that they cared about -- that those benefits were there to help take care of the family members.</text>

            <text syncTime="438.246" offset="1859921">I think what Congress was doing is Congress was making a statement -- I don't think they were trying to say they were looking at this divorce law in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.937" offset="1898687">I think what Congress was saying is that: We're just going to look to the States and let the States use their benefit and wisdom to determine which divorce laws should apply and which shouldn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.394" offset="1944558">So that in this case in particular, there -- there are benefits and detriments possibly to section D, but what this Court I think would be appropriate to do would to -- to pass a bright-line rule that said State laws that interfere with the administration of a plan are preempted, but after that, after the money has been paid out, laws that affect the benefits are not preempted, and that -- that allows the States to be--</text>

            <text syncTime="498.869" offset="2102442">Section D was a response to this Court's opinion in Egelhoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.838" offset="2118324">And at first blush it looks like, especially with the language, that that's what the States are trying to do, trying to end run preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.742" offset="2141939">But that -- when you look at it closely, that's not what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.027" offset="2155104">In -- in Egelhoff, this Court found that Congress intended to preempt a Washington statute very similar to section A, but what Congress was preempting was a State interfering with the administration of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.222" offset="2219888">It wasn't preempting a State domestic relations equitable remedy designed to protect the people to whom the Federal employee owed a duty of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.478" offset="2252907">It wasn't that -- that the States were not listening to Congress or this Court, and they're not sticking their fingers in their ears going la, la, la, I can't hear you.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.500" offset="2288956">A good example of this would be if a State had a estimated tax payment law that said when you get insurance, you've got to pay 10 percent into the court or into the State, that wouldn't be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.360" offset="2348411">But if the State thereafter had a law, enacted a law that said we want a withholding requirement and if that money is withheld then you don't have to do the estimated tax payment, well, that would clearly be preempted because it interferes with the administration of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.887" offset="2410478">But the first law would still be fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.588" offset="2425315">It shouldn't per se be preempted because it enacted the second law that is preempted because it's interfering with the administration--</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.267" offset="5012064">There -- there are two -- two points I'd like to make there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.305" offset="5032127">One, I don't think Congress was trying to get involved in the field of divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.744" offset="5065877">I don't think Congress with that law was saying all other domestic relations laws don't apply, we only want to apply these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.100" offset="5099313">There's so many other domestic relations laws like community property rights and waivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.503" offset="5120943">And children even in these divorce decrease can't file it, and then children would lose out if their parents didn't know enough to file those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.692" offset="5157723">So, the first point is that I don't think that that's what Congress was trying to do there with that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.080" offset="5179248">And the second point is that it's not a superfluous provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.698" offset="5193772">If I had a divorce decree, I would much rather file it with the court so that I knew it would get paid directly to me than have to deal with it after it's been paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.738" offset="5229926">So I think it is -- it absolutely serves a purpose, but it doesn't serve the purpose of trying to -- to get -- I think Congress was trying to make a statement, we want these benefits to be subject to State laws, not that we want these benefits--</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.963" offset="5290843">If that was Congress's intent, why limit it to a specific form of State borders involving divorce, annulment, et cetera?</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.905" offset="5342566">Why not just simply say in 80 -- 80705(e) that any court order could change the order of precedence, if that was Congress's intent?</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.965" offset="5390840">--I believe that's basically what they did, because the other type of court orders such as a waiver wouldn't make sense to put in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.337" offset="5428247">You -- you would not -- if I was paying attention if I -- if I had filed -- if I had a divorce decree that said my ex-wife waived a right to my insurance, it doesn't make sense that I'd do that additional filing because that wouldn't add anything to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.096" offset="5487284">So Congress was saying that court orders can -- that direct where money goes does that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.600" offset="5513302">And the other types of laws, like community property laws or waivers or this type of law, they would have to have a separate section for each of them to draft it in such a way that it wouldn't interfere -- it would make it easy on OPM to know where to pay the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.960" offset="5574742">And I think what they were doing is they weren't saying any types of State laws can come in, because they didn't -- they wanted to deal with the ones that were clear, that were easy for them to deal with, so that they -- so that OPM and MetLife knows where to pay the money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.071" offset="5951219">But just like a private employee, people expect their assets to be subject to divorce laws after they're paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.641" offset="5973475">And OPM is not involved in anything messy, MetLife is not involved in anything messy after it's paid out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1509.468" offset="6144838">But they did not do that -- well, the reason they did that with Servicemen's Group Life Insurance is because they wanted servicemen, no matter how much they messed up their finances, to know that they could leave some asset to whoever they wanted to regardless of--</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.296" offset="6528107">On two separate occasions, this Court has held that order of precedence provisions like those found in FEGLIA grant the insured an absolute personal right to, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.002" offset="6566977">"direct that the proceeds belong to the named beneficiary and no other. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.556" offset="6589129">In fact, Congress enacted FEGLIA just 4 years after this Court's decision in Wissner, where this Court held that the MISLA order of precedence was the controlling section of the Act, was forceful and clear in defining the scope of this Federal right, preempted post-distribution efforts to nullify the insured's choice, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.118" offset="6663421">"whether directed at the very money it received from the Government or an equivalent amount. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.512" offset="6736982">First of all, we are not dealing with the generally applicable body of law; we are dealing with something that is quite openly an attempt to do an end run on preemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.223" offset="10879793">I'd like to start off by talking about the purpose of the Federal law, which several of the Court's prior questions spoke to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2735.217" offset="11047813">So we don't deny that because there's no anti-attachment provision here, the designated beneficiary could be subject to a contracts judgment, a tort judgment, it could have to pay other outstanding obligations that that person has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.376" offset="11100476">But that is extremely different than a law like the one we have here that says, in effect, to the designated beneficiary, you know what, we don't really think you're entitled to this money.</text>

            <text syncTime="2788.102" offset="11259405">For one thing, it creates certainty in the process, not only for the insured, but also for the beneficiary, who's not going to have to face some kind of long legal contest over the money that may eat up the proceeds in attorney's fees and costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3001.919" offset="12114654">Now, that person's intent would be overridden by section D, which would essentially pluck the benefits right out of the hand of the ex-spouse that that person meant them to go to and transfer them over to somebody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="3061.707" offset="12353727">--I don't know if I can speak to how common it is, but, as we said in our brief, there may be many reasons why somebody would want to give their ex-spouse the insurance proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.813" offset="12390193">And I think what Congress was concerned with was effectuating the intent of the insured as expressed in their designated -- in their designation form -- so that there would be a clear system, a uniform system; and again, so that the beneficiary would be protected against actions much like this one, that create all this confusion over who is actually entitled to the proceeds, and may -- may eat them up in -- in legal fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.278" offset="12488100">In addition, I'd point out that if Petitioner is correct, then you could have other State laws that are like this one that try to rewrite the order of precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.336" offset="12532300">And essentially, the Federal order of precedence could be completely undone by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.240" offset="12559885">You'd also have a situation in which Federal employees attempting to figure out where their benefits are really going to go would have to make themselves familiar with State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.096" offset="12595307">As Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, there may be serious choice of law problems there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.582" offset="12617250">The vast majority of these employees are not attorneys and this is a tremendous burden to place on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.720" offset="12637834">It's much simpler and clearer to have the system that we have under Federal law, and that's why that system was set up.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel H. Ruttenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3145.061" offset="12687153">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.746" offset="12701887">First, a quick point about the -- the FEGLI handbook.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.867" offset="12718396">The FEGLI handbook came out in July 2008.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.586" offset="12729263">Warren Hillman died in July 2008.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.771" offset="12738040">So what the FEGLI handbook said -- I don't know that it applies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.156" offset="12755594">But even if it did, what it says is a recitation of the Egelhoff holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.893" offset="12774507">All it says is:</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.393" offset="12776492">"A divorce does not invalidate a designation that means your former spouse is a beneficiary. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.378" offset="12796450">It says nothing about domestic relations laws not applying after that, and that's exactly what -- this Court found in Egelhoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.113" offset="12819438">Another -- another point that my friend made was with regard to Servicemen's Group Life Insurance and the holding in Ridgway was based on the fact that these insurance proceeds belong to the designated beneficiary to the exclusion of all others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.956" offset="12878788">That was one of the main purposes this Court depended upon in ruling that the -- the State law was preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.461" offset="12908776">And you can't say that in this case, because those proceeds can belong to -- there's express enactments which allow to you assign it, and allow a Federal -- a divorce decree to direct where those go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.305" offset="12964156">So it can't be said in -- with FEGLIA that those proceeds belong to the designated beneficiary to the exclusion of all others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.542" offset="12993100">And the example that Mr. Chief Justice gave with regard to bankruptcy, the -- in the case of a bankruptcy, that's not benefiting the designated beneficiary because all their debts are being discharged anyways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.801" offset="13050151">So in that situation, it's solely benefiting the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.503" offset="13064989">I also wanted to address one of Justice Scalia's comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.307" offset="13080140">Justice Scalia was suggesting that this is not a divorce law and is not subject to the preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.792" offset="13102082">But the preemption analysis with regards -- there were I think two reasons he suggested that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.982" offset="13134892">One was it's a Federal act, and they applied in Ridgway, which was dealing with the Federal Act, the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance, they did apply the preemption analysis there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.404" offset="13168538">It was overcome, but they applied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.187" offset="13175748">And this Court's case in Egelhoff also recognized that the statute, very similar section A, the Washington version of section A, was a divorce/probate type of law, both of which are historical police powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.864" offset="13238442">The -- the only other comment I would like to make is with regard to the Slayer statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.035" offset="13267072">Many State Slayer statutes are drafted with the identical language of section D, which says if preempted then there can be a State law cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.677" offset="13313674">They're -- they're based on the same uniform code, and they use the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.329" offset="13332273">And if there are no other questions, I just would like to say what an honor it's been today and cede the rest of my time.</text>
