            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Ginsburg has our opinion this morning in case 11-597, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission versus The United States.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="9.863" offset="144865">This case concerns the Takings Clause of the Constitution, which instructs that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.994" offset="193348">When is property taken for public use?</text>
            <text syncTime="25.145" offset="205991">That question arises in the case we today resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.164" offset="222083">The Army Corps of Engineer operates a Dam on the Black River, upstream from a Wildlife Management Area owned and operated by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.442" offset="275163">The management area comprises 23,000 acres of hardwood forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.916" offset="301077">Between 1993 and 2000, the Corps operated the Dam in a manner that deviated from historical practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.170" offset="338066">The Corps did so in order to accommodate the interest of farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.861" offset="360845">The Arkansas Commission alleged that these deviations, beneficial, as they may have been to farmers, lead to unprecedented levels of flooding on its forest domain over a six-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.851" offset="420822">The cumulative effect of the recurrent flooding, the Commission stated, damaged or destroyed more than 18 million board feet of timber and altered the character of the terrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.922" offset="469096">After conducting a trial, the Court of Federal Claims ruled for the Commission, holding that the Corps' actions qualified as a taking of property, impermissible without just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.641" offset="519983">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.014" offset="533462">As a rule, the Appellate Court noted, government actions need not be permanent to count as a taking of property, but government induced flooding, the Federal Circuit held, is an exception to the general rule and must be permanent or inevitably recurring to rank as a taking of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.723" offset="620293">We reversed the Federal Circuit's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.032" offset="637534">Government induced flooding, we hold, even when finite in duration, gains no automatic exemption from Takings Clause inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.984" offset="677345">We have long held that a taking may occur when government action causes flooding of real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.050" offset="705661">We have also held that government acquisition or invasion of property can be a taking, even when temporary in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.818" offset="740665">These settled holdings lead us to conclude a government induced flooding of limited duration but severe impact can amount to a taking of property, warranting just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.839" offset="792806">In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Federal Circuit relied on United States against Sanguinetti, a 1924 decision in which this Court held that no taking occurred when a government constructed canal overflowed onto private land.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.252" offset="862396">Language in the Court's opinion accounts for the Federal Circuit's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.101" offset="881831">But the dispositive holding in Sanguinetti, was simply this, “The property owner failed to prove that the government's construction of the canal in fact caused the flooding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="206.934" offset="933136">Read in light of that no-causation holding, Sanguinetti does not establish the temporary flooding under any and all circumstances escapes assessment under the Takings Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.451" offset="995203">Removing temporary flooding from Taking Clause inspection would be out of sync with our recognition that as a rule, temporary takings maybe compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.980" offset="1037312">Why should Courts differentiate flooding from the myriad other instances of government occupation or invasion of property?</text>
            <text syncTime="240.993" offset="1069390">Given no persuasive reason to treat flooding as a unique category, we reject the temporary flooding exception on which the Federal Circuit grounded its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.911" offset="1113067">We, in no way, suggest that all floodings caused by government are compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.495" offset="1135428">Courts must assess the relevant facts and circumstances in each case to determine whether what the government has done amounts to a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.740" offset="1172417">As our decisions in this area of counsel, Courts should consider the duration of the interference, whether the invasion was foreseeable when the government acted, the severity of the interference, and the degree to which it upsets the property owner's reasonable expectations regarding the lands used.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.334" offset="1250785">The Federal Circuit did not engage in these case-specific inquiries, nor did it consider arguments about damage to downstream property or the relevance of state law, matters raised for the first time in this Court and therefore, outside our review province.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.807" offset="1324659">The Court's opinion remanding the case to the Federal Circuit is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.068" offset="1341691">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
