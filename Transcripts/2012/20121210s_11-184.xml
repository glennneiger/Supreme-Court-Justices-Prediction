            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Kagan has the opinion of the Court this morning in Case No. 11-184 Kloeckner versus Solis.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="6.811" offset="133663">Under the Civil Service Reform Act, which I'll call the CSRA for short, a federal employee who was fired, demoted or subjected to another serious personal action can challenge that action before an administrative body called the Merit Systems Protection Board which I sometimes just the Board for short.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.666" offset="221121">If the employee thinks the personnel action was not only unjustified but also based on illegal discrimination, such as race discrimination or sex discrimination, then the employee has what Federal Regulations call a mixed case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.217" offset="287263">The case is called mixed because it involves both a serious personnel action against the Federal employee and a claim of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.439" offset="328223">The petitioner in this case, Carolyn Kloeckner has such a mixed case.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.076" offset="346718">She was fired by the Department of Labor and claims that her firing was discriminatory, so she initially brought her case to the Merit Systems Protection Board, but the Board found that she had not complied with its filing deadlines and dismissed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.854" offset="417876">An employee like Ms. Kloeckner, whose mixed case is rejected by the Board is entitled to judicial review, review by a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.781" offset="453611">The question in this case is where Ms. Kloeckner should go to seek that review.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.592" offset="476808">That is a question of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.886" offset="489974">What does the CSRA say about which court Ms. Kloeckner should file suit in.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.208" offset="519231">Ms. Kloeckner says that under the CSRA, she should file a discrimination suit against the Government in Federal district court and that is in fact what she did.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.474" offset="560295">But the Government says that would be true only if the Board had ruled against her on the merits of her discrimination claim, because the Board, instead, dismissed her case on procedural grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.366" offset="603867">The Government contends Ms. Kloeckner should instead file a petition in the Federal Circuit which is a specialized Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.099" offset="638872">The courts below agreed with the Government and accordingly dismiss the suit Ms. Kloeckner filed in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.748" offset="669487">Today, we reverse that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.585" offset="680772">We hold that when the Board rules against the Federal employee who claims that a serious personnel action violates an anti-discrimination statute, the employee should seek judicial review by filing suit in district court under the applicable anti-discrimination law.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.699" offset="753288">That is true irrespective of whether the Board's decision was on the merits or on procedural grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.393" offset="784008">Our decision is based on two sections of the CSRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.400" offset="799995">We look first to Section 7703.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.059" offset="814728">That Section provides that Federal employees should generally seek judicial review of Board decisions in the Federal Circuit, but it also includes an important exception for what it describes as cases of discrimination subject to the provisions of Section 7702.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.774" offset="889543">Those cases, Section 7703 tell us, should be filed in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.076" offset="918800">We next look to Section 7702, the cross-referenced section, which tells us that cases of discrimination subject to its provisions are what I've been calling mixed cases, cases like Ms. Kloeckner's in which a Federal employee charges that a serious personnel action was discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.395" offset="999988">So, when we put Sections 7703 and 7702 together, we find a straightforward instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.618" offset="1032903">Mixed cases like Ms. Kloeckner's should be filed in district court and not in the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.749" offset="1065399">The Government's argument to the contrary, it's claimed that the CSRA sends the Board's Merits decisions to district court while sending it's procedural rulings to the Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.287" offset="1115554">Well, it's very complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.751" offset="1125480">It's so complicated that I'm not going to try to explain it to you this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.880" offset="1149931">More to the point, it's too complicated to be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.771" offset="1165500">The CSRA provides a simple answer to the question before us and we today acknowledge that clear congressional command in rejecting the Government's argument and telling Ms. Kloeckner that she was correct to file her discrimination suit in District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.808" offset="1237703">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
