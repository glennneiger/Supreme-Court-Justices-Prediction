            <text syncTime="165.891" offset="772637">In order to expand the record in a Wiggins claim, which is what's the basis of Mr. Trevino's claim, in order to expand that record, you have a 30-day window to file a motion for new trial, and 75 days -- 75 days to have a hearing on it or else the court loses jurisdiction by operation of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.562" offset="1107318">It was developed in 1995, a year before the Federal system was developed in AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.132" offset="1129574">And the concept -- and the reason for it, the rationale was to expedite these type of claims, especially in death penalty claims under Section 11.071, but the -- and the purpose is that there is two counsels that are appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.510" offset="1199165">One counsel is appointed to handle the record-based claims, and that's done on direct appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.533" offset="1347227">Let's assume, as she did in her hypothetical, that a State says -- doesn't have any case law like Texas does that says we prefer you to go that way for non-record-based claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.443" offset="1402815">Is the difference between that hypothetical State that says you can do either and the Texas situation, is that Texas in your mind puts up procedural impediments to using the direct appeal mechanism, and so that if the other State hasn't done that, has made the development of evidence, has provided a full opportunity for you to develop a record before the direct appeal is over with, that State wouldn't be subject to Martinez, and Texas is subject to it only because it has the procedural impediments?</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.184" offset="5737783">Texas's procedures for raising ineffectiveness claims are some of the most generous in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.754" offset="5764115">Those procedures offered Petitioner two bites at the apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.391" offset="5782609">The first bite came in a constitutionally protected direct appeal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.109" offset="5801522">And any deficiency in that proceeding would have been the source of cause under existing cause and prejudice standards to excuse a subsequent default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.315" offset="5838303">Allowing the Petitioner to assert cause on the basis of a second bite at the apple, that is, a State habeas proceeding, would create an unwarranted and unworkable extension of Martinez.</text>

            <text syncTime="1443.673" offset="5883756">Why is it a second bite when the Texas Supreme Court, court of criminal appeals, has said again and again, as a general rule, defendants should not raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal, should raise it on collateral review?</text>

State, States that the lack of a clear record usually will prevent the appellant from meeting the first part of the Strickland test as the reasonableness of counsel's choices and motivations during trial can be proven deficient only through facts that don't normally appear in the appellate record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.767" offset="6044147">So the only question presented by those instructions that are quoted over and over again in the Petitioner's briefs is whether and to what extent newly-appointed counsel -- as Justice Alito was pointing out, Texas provides newly-appointed counsel on direct appeal in capital cases -- can supplement the appellate record with an explanation from the trial -- trial counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.877" offset="6416549">So the way that the procedure in Texas would work, as it does in Kansas, is that the newly appointed direct appeal lawyer, who has no conflict and is therefore free to accuse trial counsel of being ineffective, would file a motion to stay the appeal, abate it and remand it to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.969" offset="6472974">The showing in both States is roughly the same; it's a facially plausible claim of ineffectiveness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2866.393" offset="11574688">The only guideline that any bar association had promulgated at the time of the direct appeal proceeding or State habeas proceeding in this case was the 1989 American Bar Association guideline 11.9.2, which specifically told the direct appeal lawyer in this case to raise every colorable claim he could, regardless of any State procedures to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.610" offset="13747553">--In the case of Sprouse in our -- it's page 20 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.605" offset="13819547">That the position in Sprouse is that there would be no constitutional defect if appellate counsel didn't have time or the record to raise the ineffective assistance claim, and that's because the habeas proceeding is available to direct -- to develop the claim and is the proper place to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.217" offset="13889973">And that's the State's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.735" offset="13896033">It's on page 20 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.519" offset="13903138">The other thing that I wanted to bring to the Court's attention is that the Respondent cites a couple of cases that are aberrant -- they're aberrations and they really don't -- shouldn't -- since this Court has -- has brought out a sensible rule in Martinez and this Court has said this Court's rule sensibly speak to the ordinary case, not the aberrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.288" offset="14022257">And that's exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.140" offset="14029676">The last thing that I wanted to say is -- is that the direct appeal, if -- if -- there's a choice here that the State has systemically developed a system that has caused -- that has directed attorneys on appeal that the habeas attorney does the extra-record claims, the Wiggins-type claims, and that the claims that are raised on the record go to the direct appeal attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.646" offset="14171677">That is the system that the State has developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.865" offset="14188500">Those are the rules that govern this system that have been promulgated by the court of criminal appeals and the Supreme Court, and that's the system, the scheme that we are under.</text>

            <text syncTime="3534.258" offset="14246074">What about the position of the State that says Martinez is relatively new, if there is an extension of Martinez to cover this case, then at least give the Texas courts the first crack at deciding whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel instead of having that done in the Federal court?</text>

            <text syncTime="3563.560" offset="14363311">And -- and because 1107.1 also has -- when they -- when that was promulgated in 1995 in order to expedite these claims, it provided three things: One, a new attorney; two, the money to fund those claims; and three, an abuse of the writ, which is Section 58, which is what we met in -- in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.025" offset="14465189">The Texas scheme, because of that abuse of the writ, proceeds -- causes procedural default, and that puts us in this quandary where a person like Mr. Trevino is unable to get relief because he has an ineffective trial lawyer and now he is -- that ineffective trial lawyer, his ineffectiveness is being insulated by the ineffectiveness of his -- of his habeas lawyer.</text>
