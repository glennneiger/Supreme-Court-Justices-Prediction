            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Ginsburg has our opinion this morning in case 11-1085, Amgen versus CT Retirement Plans &amp; Trust Funds.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.073" offset="146725">This case involves a securities-fraud complaint filed by Connecticut Retirement Plans against Biotechnology Company, Amgen and several of Amgen's officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.687" offset="209209">To gain class-action certification on the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, Connecticut Retirement invoked the "fraud-on-the-market" doctrine endorsed by This Court in a 1988 decision, Basic v. Levinson and recognized most recently in the 2011 decision Erica P. John Fund v. Halliburton.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.654" offset="321014">The fraud-on-the-market premise is if the price of a security treated in an efficient market will reflect all publicly available information about a company.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.606" offset="372840">Accordingly, a buyer of the security maybe presumed to have relied on that information in purchasing the security.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.021" offset="414532">Amgen has conceded the efficiency of the market for the securities had issued and has not contested the public character of the fraudulent statements alleged in Connecticut Retirement's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.440" offset="476181">Nor does Amgen hear dispute that Connecticut Retirement meets all four of the class-action prerequisites stated in Rule 23 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="105.951" offset="530202">Rule 23 (b)(3) states an additional requirement for class-action certification in a suit for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.907" offset="566042">That requirement is center stage in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.033" offset="582552">It reads, “The questions of law or fact common to the class members must predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.”</text>
            <text syncTime="134.152" offset="643051">To meet this predominance requirement, Amgen contends, “Connecticut Retirement must do more than plausibly plead that Amgen's misrepresentations materially affected the price of Amgen's stock.”</text>
            <text syncTime="152.591" offset="716821">“Certification must be denied,” Amgen asserts, unless Connecticut Retirement actually proves materiality at the threshold stage of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.724" offset="773350">The District Court affirmed by the Court of Appeals to the Ninth Circuit rejected the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.115" offset="794875">A proof of materiality must be made prior to class-action certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.585" offset="820788">We intern affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.689" offset="837193">Connecticut Retirement must have caused prove materiality in order to prevail on the merits of its securities-fraud suit, but that proof need not be made prior to class-action certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.173" offset="903126">Rule 23 (b)(3) says that questions common to the class must predominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.697" offset="929249">It does not require that those questions be answered on the merits in favor of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.757" offset="957461">Materiality is judged according to an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.630" offset="977000">It can be proved by evidence common to the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.163" offset="991107">Therefore, materiality presents a common question within the meaning of Rule 23 (b)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="229.370" offset="1023916">If the class representative, hear Connecticut Retirement, fails to show materiality at the merit stage, that hardly means that individual questions will predominate instead because materiality is an essential element of the securities-fraud claim, the suit will fail and its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.825" offset="1105732">In short, the class is highly cohesive, its members will succeed or lose unison and no event will the individual circumstances of particular class members matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.710" offset="1169262">Essentially, Amgen would have us put the Court before the course before certifying a securities-fraud class-action under Rule 23 (b)(3), Amgen argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.966" offset="1230284">A District Court must first determine whether the class will win the fray.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.753" offset="1253480">But the office of Rule 23 (b)(3) is not to get the case adjudicated rather it is to select the method best suited for adjudication of the controversy fairly and efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.693" offset="1317219">Here, that method is the class-action Connecticut Retirement seeks demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.412" offset="1344073">Justice Alito has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.834" offset="1357761">There are two dissenting opinions, one by Justice Scalia and the other by Justice Thomas with whom Justice Kennedy joins in full and Justice Scalia joins in all by Part 1-B.</text>
