            <text syncTime="6.837" offset="133385">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.772" offset="149163">The decision of the Court of Appeals deprives the Defendant of the ability to free itself from litigation even when it is willing to pay complete relief to the sole Plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.329" offset="195347">Thus, as long as the Plaintiff refuses to accept full and complete payment, a putative collective action must continue onward to certification.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="31.269" offset="231187">Did that offer include admission of liability, or was it just that it was going to pay the amount of damages requested?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="45.045" offset="286253">That's a good question, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.228" offset="294926">Because it was an offer of judgment, if the offer had been accepted, the result would have been a judgment by the Federal Court imposing liability under the statute, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, on the Defendant, and requiring the Defendant to pay full and complete relief, including costs and attorneys' fees, to the Plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.089" offset="362426">So there would have been a judgment of the Federal Court imposing liability under the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="78.516" offset="420105">Well, I think there is rules of issuing claim conclusion that would flow from the judgment, and it would have--</text>

            <text syncTime="83.420" offset="439749">Well, that -- so the next case is another employee who claims uncompensated work time, and that's brought on behalf of similarly situated people.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.494" offset="496069">Then that next case, the employer would be -- would be subject to summary judgment because the liability has been established.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.183" offset="530760">--Well, there would be a variety of fact questions that would have to be resolved to determine the extent of the preclusion from the first judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.718" offset="552911">But the rules of issue and claim preclusion would apply, and to the extent those rules call for matters that were comprehended within the judgment to bind, in a later case they would.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.443" offset="591782">I think the way that I would put it, looking back to Justice Kagan's opinion in the Smith v. Bayer case, it's common for there to be preclusive effect of a judgment in one case against people that are not parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.501" offset="640056">And this would have been a judgment imposing liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act based on the allegations made in the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="178.927" offset="821764">The -- the offer itself was a formal offer of judgment on a form promulgated by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.914" offset="841721">The offer itself is not an admission of liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.532" offset="1164177">The first one is to talk about what happened in this particular case, which is the case that's before the court; and, the second is to discuss the practical consequences of what could have happened in some other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.221" offset="1198972">So what happened in this case is that it was uncontested that the offer provided complete relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.475" offset="1227915">And so the Respondent suffered a judgment to be entered against her because of the conceded acts of the offer.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.113" offset="1358528">--Well, I think there is two questions to unpack here that -- that are implicit in both what the Chief Justice is commenting on and what you're commenting on, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.719" offset="1392905">One is the question that was presented in the petition, which is: What is the effect on a collective action if, before certification or any motion for collective process has been determined, the sole plaintiff loses the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.048" offset="1478273">The second one is: How do you deal with the housekeeping issues of terminating the interest of a plaintiff when there's no longer controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="352.690" offset="1516830">Well, it seems as though it's more than housekeeping issue that's involved here because -- I mean, I realize that you have an argument about what happens when the plaintiff's individual claims have been fully satisfied, but the plaintiff continues to want to represent other individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.516" offset="1584121">But, here, the plaintiff's individual claims have not been fully satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.215" offset="1670952">One is, we view it as a housekeeping question because it seems to us clear that, if the Defendant no longer wishes to contest liability and formally offers to pay all of the relief that the person could possibly win in any formal litigation, it has to be the case that the individual's interest is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.795" offset="1753290">Now, it might be that the appropriate response is, as is consistent with the Third Circuit, is that the district court should just dismiss the case, because if the person won't take yes for an answer, the Federal Court doesn't need anything further--</text>

            <text syncTime="540.541" offset="2268216">It says:</text>
            <text syncTime="541.310" offset="2271351">"A case becomes moot when it's impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party. "</text>

            <text syncTime="573.095" offset="2398410">I think Knox flows naturally from Friends of the Earth, and I think they're both saying exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.499" offset="2420040">And the -- what's going on in those cases, and I suppose in the Nike case from last month, is this general problem of a defendant is faced with a piece of litigation and they no longer wish to contest it.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.391" offset="2467582">If the action seeks prospective relief, it's quite difficult, once the case has begun, for the defendant to convince the court that they are going to change their conduct in a way that moots the claim for prospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.717" offset="2520977">And this Court's had a series of cases and has often not been convinced of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.252" offset="2535083">In a case that only seeks retrospective relief, it's somewhat easier to convince the court of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.637" offset="2556608">One way would be to formally offer to pay everything the person could get.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.024" offset="2574162">What happened in this case and what's before the Court is simply if that happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.910" offset="2593702">So what happened here is there was an offer that was conceded to be adequate and the plaintiff suffered a judgment to be entered against her on the premise that she had no further claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.283" offset="2631213">And the question is if that interest is gone, which has been conceded at all stages of the litigation until the bottom side briefing on the merits in this Court, what's the consequences for the collective action.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.091" offset="2682413">And so what the parties have litigated about, because this was conceded repeatedly over the course of several years, is what happens when that interest is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.781" offset="2713133">Now, we believe that it is correct that a defendant faced with litigation that it does not wish to contest can terminate the litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.691" offset="7960820">There is nothing in that rule that gives the court that power, certainly not stated explicitly or even implicitly, because it talks about an entire procedure of accepting the offer or rejecting it, all of it in the hands of the parties, none of it until the entry of the judgment in the hands of the court and only after the plaintiff has accepted the offer in writing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.558" offset="8376271">But we think that they set up two principles that help inform the Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.793" offset="8393199">The first is that when you have circumstances like this, in which a claim has gone away as moot because the named representative of the claim has gone away for one reason or another, there is play in the joints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.620" offset="8440533">Essentially, you can have a bridge plaintiff who acts to keep the case alive for purposes of letting the class unfold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.373" offset="8475537">That's really what then -- Justice Rehnquist was getting at in his decision in Roper, and we think there is a lot of force to that because otherwise, as Justice Ginsburg mentioned, the collective action mechanism doesn't even get off the ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.143" offset="13034635">But for a judgment entered by a concession, the actual issue is not litigated and necessary to the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.897" offset="13381646">But when we have an allegation like we have here, which there is a widespread policy of deducting 30 minutes a day, notwithstanding the employer's knowledge that the employers -- employees are working through that lunch break, there is every reason to think that there is a substantial body of -- of employees similarly situated, and it would be an abuse of discretion for the Court not to proceed at least down that road, provide some discovery, facilitate class notice -- as the Court in Hoffman-LaRoche recognizes is the appropriate thing to do under Section 216 -- and at the end of that process, which could be short for some cases, a little longer for some, should be, of course, always exercised in the Court's sound discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.836" offset="13533365">At the end of the case, if there are more plaintiffs who opt in, then it proceeds as a collective action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3425.947" offset="13809845">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.284" offset="13823220">I think the most useful thing to do is to address the point that Justice Breyer has raised several times because I think it's important to discuss the relationship between what I would call the statutory facts and the constitutional questions that they might raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.226" offset="13882988">And so I do think it's fair in a sense to think about this as a statutory case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.262" offset="13903155">When a plaintiff files suit in a Federal court, often the cause of action rests on a statute that Congress has adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.832" offset="13925411">Those statutes have a lot of attributes that Congress can control to make it easier or harder for a defendant to make an offer of complete relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.422" offset="13955713">They can provide for mandatory seeking of attorney's fees, as this one does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.557" offset="13976297">They can alter the rules for shifting costs, as perhaps the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act does from last month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.878" offset="13997613">They can provide for injunctive or declaratory relief, which makes it basically impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.313" offset="14011302">But Congress gets to decide, when they write a statute, whether they want to make it a statute for which it--</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="3481.484" offset="14031991">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.834" offset="14033349">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.600" offset="14036484">And so what we would be reading into this statute is a relation-back doctrine, which happens every day of the week in class action cases and has historical analogies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.322" offset="14071383">So I understand the difference you're pointing to, but why not read that in?</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.976" offset="14086012">It would be fair, and it would get the job done that Congress sets up in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.047" offset="14110253">That's the argument the other way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3502.347" offset="14115478">--Well, that leads me to the second point I wanted to make, which is exactly what is the constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.249" offset="14131047">And I think the way to get to it is when my colleague, Mr. Katyal, refers to the worst that happens, well, the worst that happens, I think it's -- it's important to understand what the worst thing is that happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.723" offset="14172947">The worst thing is -- that happens is the case is on the docket of the Federal district judge, and there is no plaintiff with an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.912" offset="14205757">And the procedure in the district court is we should spend some time, have some discovery, look around to see if we can find another plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.934" offset="14241806">And so I think that that's a different problem from how the district court should decide the order of hearing -- of deciding motions.</text>
