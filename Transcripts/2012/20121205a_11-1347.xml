            <text syncTime="11.189" offset="150899">United States courts have the power to effectuate relief in the Hague Convention cases under circumstances presented here in this international treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.246" offset="191127">Sergeant First Class -- First Class Chafin's appeal from the district court's decision is not moot because reversal of the district court's judgment could grant Sergeant Chafin relief in three ways, each sufficient to preclude mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.304" offset="243372">First, a reversal would mean that the United States is the child's habitual residence; second, the district court or court of appeals should order Ms. Chafin to bring the child back to the United States and overturn the monetary award; and, third, it would effectuate relief in the ongoing Alabama case and the Scottish case by, one, letting Alabama courts proceed to determine custody and, two, cause the Scottish court to stay or dismiss its proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.062" offset="13730393">First of all, these courts have inherent authority to order the child be brought back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.549" offset="13752335">It is a way of reversing the wrong decision of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.018" offset="13766233">When we are talking about the object of the Convention, it is in part rapid return, but that is kind of putting the cart before the horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.440" offset="13799878">The critical issue is where is the appropriate habitual residence of the child, and that is the place that then needs to make the custodial decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3430.594" offset="13828508">Well, what he says is that after 18 months in Scotland, the Scottish court will decide where is the habitual residence of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.967" offset="13866020">We are now in August of year 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.736" offset="13877096">And what happened before January of year one is now totally irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.989" offset="13902069">So even if the American courts decided prior to January of year 1 the correct habitual residence was Alabama, when the Scottish courts decide what is his habitual residence as of 18 months later, they won't pay any attention at all to that American decision because it is not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.921" offset="13993811">That, I take it, to be his argument, which depends on the long-time, 18 months.</text>
