            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Breyer has our opinion this morning in case 11-626, Lozman versus the City of Riviera Beach in Florida.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="9.768" offset="145471">Fane Lozman who is the petitioner here owned a floating home.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.012" offset="166473">It consisted of a house-like plywood structure with French doors on three sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.829" offset="189774">It contained a sitting room, bedroom, closet, bathroom, and kitchen along with a stairway leading to a second-level office space.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.414" offset="228122">An empty build space underneath the main floor kept it afloat.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.440" offset="248184">The home could not propel itself across the water, but it could be towed.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.259" offset="267515">And it was towed a few times over several years from one marina to another, eventually ending up docked at a marina owned by the respondent, The City or Riviera Beach, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.448" offset="320282">After several, rather heated disputes, the city brought this lawsuit against Lozman in Federal Court for dockage fees and trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.071" offset="362705">It invoked the Court's Admiralty Jurisdiction and the presence of Admiralty Jurisdiction, the lower court say, “Depends upon whether Lozman's floating home is a vessel,” as that term is defined in Title I of the United States Code, Section III.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.819" offset="429683">The lower court said that it was a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.645" offset="441072">And with the hope of resolving certain differences among the lower courts about to how to determine what is and what is not a vessel, we agreed to hear this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.109" offset="482868">Now, the statute defines “vessel” as including, “Every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.”</text>
            <text syncTime="111.228" offset="551309">To go to the bottom line, we conclude that Lozman's floating home falls outside this definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.219" offset="579312">It is not a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.620" offset="588925">In explaining why that is so, we have attached two pictures to today's opinion comparing Lozman's home with a wharf boat of a kind that this Court, many years ago, also held was not a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.226" offset="643365">And even though a picture is worth a thousand words, we have written a few words of explanation as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.110" offset="674920">We explained that the Court should not interpret the statutory phrase as if it covered virtually every artificial contrivance that floats.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.599" offset="712850">They must avoid reading the statute, and we say some have not avoided reading the statute, as if it covered, for example, a wooden washtub, a swimming platform on pontoons, a door taken off its hinges, or Pinocchio inside the whale.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.521" offset="784530">We believe the courts must interpret the statute in a practical way in light of its focus upon transportation, which is more than mere movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.586" offset="824759">We state that often, as here, the proper test will be whether a reasonable observer, looking to a structure's physical characteristics and activities, would consider it to be designed to a practical degree for carrying people or things on water.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.290" offset="895603">And applying this test, we hold that Lozman's home falls outside the statute's language capable of being used for transportation on water.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.813" offset="933742">Lozman's home was structured like a normal home, not like a boat designed to carry people or things from place to place.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.350" offset="963835">It was not capable of self-propulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.453" offset="976269">It had been towed significant distances only twice in seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.151" offset="995077">It was cumbersome to move it over the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.899" offset="1006049">On at least one occasion, a second boat followed along to prevent Lozman's home from swinging dangerously from side to side while being towed.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.904" offset="1042098">And then, there is the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.810" offset="1053696">I need say no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.968" offset="1062264">We reverse the contrary determination of the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.956" offset="1078251">Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion in which she is joined by Justice Kennedy.</text>
