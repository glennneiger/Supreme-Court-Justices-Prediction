            <text syncTime="13.891" offset="162509">The Third Circuit held in this case that the assessment of the adequacy of expert evidence offered in support of class certification is a merits question that has no place in the class certification inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.567" offset="221232">According to the Third Circuit and to the plaintiffs in this Court, what is sufficient is for the proponents of class certification to point to some abstract methodology, such as econometrics or regression analysis, that conceivably might be applied to the problem at hand in a way in which in the fullness of time will evolve into admissible evidence by the time of the class trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="91.955" offset="474829">Because generally -- at least it's my impression -- that in class certifications, if the liability question can be adjudicated on a class basis, then the damages question may be adjudicated individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.570" offset="573258">Take a -- take a Title VII case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.336" offset="580364">A liability -- pattern of practice of discrimination, therefore liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.307" offset="600217">But damages can be assessed on an individual basis, so why isn't bifurcation possible here?</text>

            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="133.698" offset="641804">--Well, let me make two points in response to that question, Justice Ginsburg: One about what the legal standards are, and, you know, the second one, which is as important, about what the record in this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.070" offset="683286">With respect to the first point, what the rule asks us to look at is not questions of damages versus liability, but whether the common questions predominate over those that are individual to the class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.194" offset="735740">I don't disagree, and it is not my position today, that there may be cases in which individual damages questions are consistent with class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.269" offset="780044">But as the lower courts have recognized, it is not the case that all damages questions may -- may remain individual consistently with class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.060" offset="827169">Indeed, the 1966 advisory notes expressly say that questions of damages with respect to class members may or may not predominate in cases like this; i.e., antitrust class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.902" offset="882548">Let--</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="194.352" offset="884429">Mr. Estrada, doesn't Justice Ginsburg's question actually point out that the -- the law that both the district court and the circuit court used in this case was actually quite favorable to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.794" offset="930196">Unlike some courts, both the district court and the circuit court said that the plaintiffs needed to show that there was a class-wide measurement of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.250" offset="971992">And then in addition, both courts said really, it was -- the burden was on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that that class-wide measure of damages existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.410" offset="1020579">Now, I understand that you have problems with the way in which the plaintiffs met that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.913" offset="1046597">You say that they didn't meet that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.015" offset="1055061">But it seems to me that the legal standard that was used was exactly the legal standard that you wanted, that the plaintiffs had to come in and show by a preponderance that they had a class-wide way to measure damages in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="253.708" stopTime="278.342">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="253.708" offset="1121830">--I don't think that's right, Justice Kagan.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.993" offset="1126950">I think we can have a healthy debate about whether the district court did what you just finished saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.529" offset="1149102">I think there can be no debate that the court of appeals did so, because repeatedly throughout its opinion said that the questions as to the adequacy of whether they had complied with the Hydrogen Peroxide standard was a merits question that was for later adjudication in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="278.342" stopTime="317.300">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="278.342" offset="1220364">Well, here's what the district court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.875" offset="1226424">"The experts' opinions raise substantial issues of fact and credibility that we are required to resolve to decide the pending motion. "</text>
            <text syncTime="287.614" offset="1257458">That is the motion for class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.698" offset="1265817">"Having rigorously analyzed the experts' reports, we conclude that the class has met its burden to demonstrate that the elements of antitrust impact is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class, and that there is a common methodology available to measure and quantify damages on a class-wide basis. "</text>
            <text syncTime="309.695" offset="1345752">So that seems to me exactly what you say they should have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.580" offset="1357245">Now, you disagree with their ultimate determination, but not with the statement of the law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="317.300" stopTime="495.416">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="317.300" offset="1376158">Well, I think that it is true that our position in the district court was that Hydrogen Peroxide controlled, and that the district court correctly stated the holding of the Third Circuit ruling in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.791" offset="1430179">Beyond that, I don't think that we do agree, because in the Third Circuit, once the case got there, we got a rule of law saying that although this court prescribed the rule amendment, 23(f), precisely to enable courts of appeals to review whether the district court got it right for important policy questions, that the job of the court of appeals under 23(f) can be fully discharged by saying that providence will provide; we'll think about it in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.996" offset="1550969">And that is not consistent with the proposition that the correct law was applied in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.900" offset="1574584">Furthermore, although the district court did enounce the correct standard in reflecting the holding of Hydrogen Peroxide, it is far from apparent -- and this is part of our point to the Third Circuit -- excuse me; to the Third Circuit -- which was not actually heard on the merits, that what he did was different from simply saying that econometrics and regression analysis are well established methodologies for dealing with problems of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.352" offset="1696419">And I will ask you to look at the top of page 145 of the Pet.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.221" offset="1715854">App., where you can look at discussions -- I'm sorry, it's 131 in footnote 24, where the district court made clear that his understanding of the capable class-wide proof involved the inquiry whether the plaintiffs actually had evidence that reflected the methodologies that had been used in this case -- in these kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.105" offset="1819404">He says,</text>
            <text syncTime="428.755" offset="1822016">"It is undisputed that multiple regression analysis is an acceptable and widely recognized statistical tool for cases of this kind. "</text>
            <text syncTime="439.496" offset="1864961">So at a very general level, I don't have a disagreement with you that in many cases where there is error, the district court started out with the right foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.368" offset="1904458">I don't agree with you that the correct standard either was applied by the district court or was even attempted by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.308" offset="1940194">Now, if we were to go to the merits of the question -- and to answer, you know, the second part of the question that I started out with Justice Ginsburg, keep in mind that even on the assumption that the district court accepted that there was common class proof of antitrust impact, that is not the same as accepting -- and I don't think the district court accepted -- that there was common class-wide proof that the impact for every individual was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.362" offset="2068403">And that is a key point about what the theory of impact here was.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="495.416" stopTime="502.420">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="495.416" offset="2088674">It doesn't have to be the same for every member of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.535" offset="2101108">As the dissenting judge pointed out, you can have subclasses.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="502.420" stopTime="571.416">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="502.420" offset="2116677">Well, and I'm happy to also deal with that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.557" offset="2133187">There are cases, indeed, in which, you know, the variances of the classes can be dealt with, with subclasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.961" offset="2162862">No one on the plaintiffs' side has actually asserted here that the record would allow this.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.214" offset="2183864">And Mr. Jordan pointed out, there is considerable basis for skepticism in thinking that that could ever be accomplished because we are talking about 649 franchise areas with different competitive conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.506" offset="2232974">But if you go back to the theory of impact, and the theory of impact was that RCN, this putative overbuilder, was, you know, the little engine that could, that it was going out to radiate out to the entire DMA area and completely overbuild the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.949" offset="2294728">So the theory of impact was if you drop a stone in the water, you are going to have ripples all the way out, so you have ripples as to every member of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.555" offset="2329209">It doesn't mean that every ripple is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.025" offset="2343107">So -- so that the key question for the damages issue in front of you now is whether what McClave came up with was an adequate methodology for measuring the size of the ripple--</text>

            <text syncTime="571.416" offset="2392635">Are there cases in the -- in the ordinary course of class actions -- I know they are all different -- where the district court can find that common questions do predominate without addressing the question whether damages can be proven on a class-wide basis, or are they always interlinked?</text>

            <text syncTime="605.054" offset="2527218">And I fully accept, and I am not arguing, that the mere fact that there may be individual damages questions precludes class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.445" offset="2568805">I am actually arguing for the flip side of that issue, which is that just because it -- it may not be preclusive in certain cases doesn't mean that it is preclusive in no case.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.086" offset="2615303">I would refer the Court to the Fifth Circuit's opinion by Judge Garwood in the Bell v. AT&amp;T case, which was, like this, an antitrust case, where the Fifth Circuit acknowledged that in many of these cases it's almost hornbook law that there may be individual issues that would not preclude class cert, but that there are certain cases in which the theory of injury and -- and the proof that would be needed to make it out is so sui generous and individualized--</text>

            <text syncTime="3351.210" offset="13511812">Let me -- let me start with the proposition which I continue to find startling, that a damages model can stand up to examination on the theory that it is not linked to any theory of anticompetitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.201" offset="13567818">Now, the theory seems to be that whether the McClave model is intended to do is to isolate competitive markets elsewhere that are competitive in some sense, come to the conclusion that the Philadelphia DMA is somehow less competitive, and charge whatever the expert says is the difference to Comcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.050" offset="13655172">But that has a fundamental failure as a matter of substantive antitrust law, because we know from cases from this Court and the court of appeals going back to story parchment, that the one requirement is that causation link of the damages, you know, it has to be certainly linked to illegal conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3466.882" offset="13974493">Now, that'll be a new number.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.511" offset="14036978">I think all you have to do is whether the proponent -- is to ask whether the proponent of class certification has discharged his duty under this Court's cases to come forward with evidence that is persuasive under the point whether the case as a whole can be tried as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.103" offset="14095387">You don't have to become an econometrician; you have to know enough to assess whether the record that has been proffered is probative on the question before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.524" offset="14129033">Here, it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.559" offset="14133213">And one of the reasons it isn't is because they came to the hearing in class certification in the fall of 2009 after full merits discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.232" offset="14171874">The papers -- we said to them,</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.267" offset="14180024">"We have full merits discovery; this model does not work. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3551.005" offset="14310950">We go to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.705" offset="14317742">It is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.774" offset="14322026">Then it goes back to the -- to the district court for further trial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.511" offset="14345014">The district court, having read the court of appeals' opinion, invites them to submit the evolutionary model that the court of appeals had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.867" offset="14378450">We are still sticking with our story: McClave's the guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.818" offset="14390258">And so they have had every conceivable opportunity to develop a model.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.370" offset="14408439">Why haven't they done that, Justice Breyer?</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.072" offset="14415231">Oh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.839" offset="14418365">Maybe because there is a problem in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.507" offset="14429023">You can take all of the maps in the record, which are part of the field supplemental appendix, and you can see the different areas of penetration for DBS, you know, has different rates of penetration all over the class area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.784" offset="14490150">Same thing for RCN and FiOS.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.303" offset="14504152">And you can look at what -- what the market penetration is in each franchise area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.623" offset="14529438">Consider that each of them is a different licensing authority, that the overbuilding would have to go to franchise by franchise and radiate out in the fullness of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.579" offset="14569249">And I don't know if there is any kind of attrition that can combine all of that into a single class or subclasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.918" offset="14598610">They haven't identified one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.551" offset="14605193">And the key point for the resolution of the case in front of you, Justice Kagan, is that the question that comes here is whether a class that is more expansive than the one that you -- that you certified in Walmart can possibly be certified where there is no evidence that is tied to the record in the case that is reliably probative that a class would exist.</text>
