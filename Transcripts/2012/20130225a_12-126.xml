            <text syncTime="8.020" offset="139661">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.789" offset="150737">We're not dealing here with the situation where a prisoner is trying to gather new evidence as to have a tolling rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.359" offset="176964">That takes care of that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.426" offset="181248">We're also not dealing with anything that prevented Petitioner from filing, because that's the problem you sought in Holland.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.547" offset="205699">What we have here is the question of when a petitioner must file his Federal habeas petition when he has the evidence and there are no barriers to filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.718" offset="238404">And 2244(d)(1)(D) addresses that exact question.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.937" offset="255227">It says, “ within 1 year ”.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.122" offset="260034">Now, Mr. Perkins asks for a fairly dramatic expansion of Holland.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.258" offset="276543">What he wants is equitable abrogation with no diligence, no fault or any other factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.162" offset="300158">And our primary position is that you should simply apply the plain language of 2244(d)(1)(D).</text>

            <text syncTime="75.593" offset="409872">Well, he -- he does say that, and we read that as a concession that sometimes if you wait too long, that can actually trump a claim of actual innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.849" offset="442891">And so, at a minimum, our alternative position is that you have to act with diligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="88.986" offset="463475">We've had a miscarriage of justice exception for as long as there's been a habeas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.907" offset="491165">We've applied it repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.109" offset="499942">It's not that it trumps it, but that it puts into doubt the evidence you're claiming.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.446" offset="533274">Proves your actual innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.648" offset="542156">It's not the sort of situation where as reasonable -- as due diligence will do, which is to override even an actually innocent person.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>

            <text syncTime="133.348" offset="640899">But what diligence does that his rule doesn't do is it recognizes this compelling, countervailing State interest in having notice and an opportunity to investigate evidence as soon as it's discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.488" offset="685516">Now -- and the problem here, we don't have any issue at all if it takes 10, 15, 100 years to find new evidence, but once you have that evidence, the burden is on him to come forward so that the State has the opportunity to investigate.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.773" offset="810590">Now, if I were the prisoner, I'd say, you know, this one might not work.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.559" offset="821771">Maybe I can get two.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.244" offset="828458">And then he gets a second, which makes a certain amount of sense to me, although a substantial period of time elapses.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.815" offset="854790">And the same thing happens with the third.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.931" offset="863253">It makes sense to me that the prisoner might try to wait for the third.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.902" offset="883106">How -- how does that factor into your diligence, assuming we get there?</text>

            <text syncTime="200.622" offset="910065">Justice Kennedy, there's a very simple solution to that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.524" offset="921663">If he gets close to the end of his year and he thinks that that next affidavit might be just around the corner but he doesn't have it yet, all he has to do is file a protective habeas petition with the district court, ask for a stay, and say I'm still diligently pursuing what I think is going to be another affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.869" offset="982999">And if he can't find that next affidavit, you litigate it on the merits, and if he does, then he amends his petition and then you hear it.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.413" offset="1053216">That -- that -- that causes its own congestion problems in the district court, it seems to me.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="240.882" offset="1071083">Two thoughts on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.715" offset="1074427">First, we already see this in the exhaustion area.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.601" offset="1085921">There are petitioners who are concerned that, notwithstanding statutory tolling for pursuing State remedies, that while they're monkeying around in State court, they might somehow be time-barred from bringing their Federal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.792" offset="1126672">So, we see this all the time in the Sixth Circuit, you know, in Michigan in particular, that someone will file their petition and ask for a stay while they exhaust State remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.665" offset="1162199">So, you know, that the pile really isn't going to be any different than it is right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.450" offset="1177350">But the key difference between that scenario and the scenario that Perkins proposes is that when you have him file something, the State's on notice they have an opportunity to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.423" offset="1217265">Now here, we have his last affidavit from the dry cleaning clerk, and it's 10 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.476" offset="1237431">So even if Michigan could find that person, there's no way for us to meaningfully cross-examine her and investigate what she really knew or didn't know when she wrote that affidavit 10 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.165" offset="1276197">And so with the file and stay, you preserve all of the rights, but yet you get the State, the countervailing interest that the statute was meant to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.854" offset="1310992">And I do want to--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="302.287" stopTime="312.493">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="302.287" offset="1316634">What did -- what would it take to -- what would it take to show diligence?</text>
            <text syncTime="305.156" offset="1328128">And didn't he say that he tried to get a lawyer several times and was unsuccessful?</text>

            <text syncTime="312.493" offset="1357490">--Sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.676" offset="1362192">And that's a very practical question that I'd like to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.545" offset="1373686">Most of the habeas petitioners don't have lawyers, but filing the habeas petition itself is not something that takes great difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.651" offset="1406182">Every district court on their web site has a place where you click for forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.603" offset="1421960">In the Eastern District of Michigan, when you click that the very first two entries are habeas petitions for Federal prisoners and State prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.022" offset="1451635">And it's a relatively simple form, you check some boxes, say when your conviction was, and you write your claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.743" offset="1470548">And then every Federal district court in the country has full-time pro se staff attorneys who go through these pro se petitions, and if there is a legitimate claim there, then they can work that up for the judge if necessary and the State will respond.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.474" offset="1549438">The district court as I understand it said to the Petitioner: You lose for two reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.624" offset="1654032">But anyway, so you lose for two reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.199" offset="2348367">The analytical construct I want to set up is that we've got three different categories of prisoners who claim actual innocence based on new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.119" offset="2380027">In the first category, they used that new evidence only to try to establish innocence with no constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.040" offset="2403642">And in Herrera you say no Federal habeas remedy for that; you have to go back to the State courts, executive clemency, prosecutorial discharging of verdicts, and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.064" offset="2443766">The second category is where you have a prisoner who uses new evidence as a gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.132" offset="2464037">It's not related to the constitutional claim that they assert -- the true Schlup gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.870" offset="2487025">And that's not actually this case either and you could reserve that question, although I'm happy to talk about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.174" offset="2508236">The case we have here is the third instance, where the evidence of actual innocence, the new evidence, is the factual predicate for the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.680" offset="2538225">And you could not find a provision more on all fours with that category than what Congress did in 2244(d)(1)(D).</text>
            <text syncTime="614.684" offset="2566228">And we know Congress was thinking about actual innocence in Schlup.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.569" offset="2581797">For those of you who are interested in the context, in the legislative debate in '95 and '96 before AEDPA's enactment we have Senators Feingold and Kennedy and Dodd, among others, talking about how this new statute is going to eliminate claims of actual innocence based on new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.612" offset="2650029">In fact, Senator Feingold even mentioned the Schlup decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.731" offset="2662463">And yet Congress adopts 2244(d)(1)(D) and all the rest of the provisions by a 91 to 8 vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.819" offset="2690780">So, Congress had this Court's decision in Schlup in the back of its mind, it considered this particular construct and it said no, we want a 1-year limitations period.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.870" offset="2795061">And in the Herrera case, there is no constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.387" offset="2805092">So there is no factual predicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.089" offset="2811883">It's just a stand-alone “ I'm innocent ” claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.374" offset="2821079">And this Court has said, appropriately so, that the Federal habeas remedy doesn't cover that.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.175" offset="2840200">You know, if you think about the remedies you can get from State courts, from prosecutors, from executive clemency, it's rather a big circle, and AEDPA is a much smaller circle that's subsumed in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.717" offset="2882414">And you recognize in Herrera that just because you don't fall within the habeas circle doesn't mean that you can't get relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.387" offset="2909059">In fact, if you look at the examples that the amici briefs cite on the Respondent's side, in almost every case the final decision is motivated by State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.410" offset="2945212">There's a governor who grants clemency in a couple of cases, there's a State attorney general's office that dismisses charges in others, county prosecutors who do the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.749" offset="2978545">One which the amicus brief characterizes as a habeas grant is actually the Illinois Court of Appeals in a State proceeding reversing.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.521" offset="3009578">You know, what the -- these are the best examples that they have for why you need an equitable abrogation rule and yet in the vast majority of those cases, it's the State system that's solving the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.646" offset="3054091">Now, I do want to go back to what I think is -- is the trickiest question and that's, Justice Kennedy, the second category of prisoners, those who are using actual innocence to prove, not their underlying constitutional claim, but simply the Schlup gateway.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.506" offset="3117516">And I would respectfully submit that even there Congress has closed the door with 2244(d)(1)(D).</text>
            <text syncTime="758.160" offset="3140190">And the best way to understand that is by looking two subprovisions earlier in the second and successive petitions category.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.464" offset="3393369">What that means is that if you have a successive petition, Congress requires you to prove actual innocence and diligence, and you still have to prove that you satisfied the statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.175" offset="6276243">I would like to start with Justice Kagan's question regarding the important background interpretive principle here that's set out, set out in Holland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.446" offset="6305291">There the Court held that longstanding equitable rules in the habeas context are incorporated into AEDPA barring a clear command by Congress to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.869" offset="6339041">And the longstanding miscarriage of justice exception has had a well-settled meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.754" offset="6354505">It has allowed petitioners who can meet the high standing of showing actual innocence a procedural gateway around a procedural bar to allow them to present their otherwise barred constitutional claims in Federal court.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="1574.063" offset="6403825">Before you proceed with that, can you address Justice Alito's point that the district court said there is no merit to this; it's not an actual innocence -- it's not a valid actual innocence claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.554" offset="6457741">And then the Sixth Circuit sends it back for the district court to decide something it's already decided?</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.142" offset="6484073">How do you overcome that the Sixth Circuit never reviewed the actual innocence question, the district court did and said it doesn't make it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Chad A. Readler</label>
            <text syncTime="1604.083" offset="6523883">That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.216" offset="6532347">And with respect to Justice Alito's question, the reform recommendation from the magistrate denied this petition on statute of limitations grounds solely, and said it was too late and it missed the statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.342" offset="6580935">At the district court level, the court held that the statute of limitations was missed and that there was no diligence; the court believed there was a diligence requirement and so the petition failed for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.198" offset="6616357">And then, as Justice Alito noted, the court added some other language which said -- was not a weighing of the evidence, but the court said that it felt that the evidence was not new in the sense that it was reasonably -- potentially reasonably known at the time of trial, which I think is one -- was, one, the wrong legal standard but, two, was a misinterpretation of Schlup, because Schlup allows you to consider all the evidence, old and new, and I don't think that's what the district -- the district court I think applied the wrong legal standard, so it wasn't actually getting to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.596" offset="6717921">It didn't sort of set out all the evidence and weigh them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.515" offset="6725549">And then, Justice Ginsburg, you are correct that this was not part of the certificate of appealability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.317" offset="6740804">The certificate of appealability was limited on the narrow question of whether there was a diligence requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.621" offset="6758045">That factual issue was not before the Sixth Circuit and hasn't -- it is not before this Court as well, and what I think this Court should do is what it did in Schlup, which is announce the standard that should apply and then it remanded the case back to the district court for application of the correct standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.196" offset="6812275">The district court -- or you seem to suggest the district court was wrong in saying that there wasn't sufficient evidence for an actual-innocence claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.624" offset="12978009">Three brief points about Holland, and some closing thoughts about diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.944" offset="13003296">With respect to Holland, I want to note first of all that there, you were dealing with legislative assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.931" offset="13023253">Everyone agreed that Congress had not done anything about equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.466" offset="13037359">And as I explained earlier, when you consider the three categories of defendants who claim actual innocence based on new evidence, this situation here, where the new evidence relates to a factual predicate of the constitutional claim asserted, that's where Congress most clearly meant to have a limitations period apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.028" offset="13111652">So it's very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.114" offset="13115936">With respect to equitable tolling applying to acts of Congress, everyone recognizes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.916" offset="13135162">Mr. Chief Justice, you note that this has never been applied to limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.634" offset="13150104">I actually have to take issue with my friend's statement that Sanders and Kuhlmann somehow took a different tack, because in both of those cases, what Congress did is it left it to the district judge's discretion to do or not do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.693" offset="13202349">And all this Court said was well, if they've got discretion, then they can still have an equitable exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.429" offset="13221261">So even in those cases, this miscarriage of justice exception has never ever been used to override a congressional act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.268" offset="13248638">The last thing is that in equitable tolling, you are dealing with the fault of the petitioner -- Hurricane Katrina or something else happened, that wasn't their fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.691" offset="13282283">And here, it's entirely within the Petitioner's control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.893" offset="13295136">All they have to do is print the form, check the boxes, attach the evidence and then file the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.628" offset="13314048">And they have an unlimited time to find evidence and then 1 year after that, to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.015" offset="13335573">Now, with respect to diligence--</text>

            <text syncTime="3325.274" offset="13408612">I mean, a number of my colleagues have said can we really believe that Congress contemplated this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.211" offset="13428360">But, I mean, don't we have evidence that Congress contemplated it, in the second and successive context, a slightly tighter version, wouldn't it be quite odd to say that Congress contemplated an actual-innocence exception when you are on your second petition but barred it when you are on your first?</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.505" offset="13497532">What sense would that be.</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.872" offset="13503070">Let me explain that and I'm glad you raised that because, you know, besides the legislative history that informs what we are looking at here, what they did in 2244(d)(1)(D) is they made it broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.880" offset="13543090">They said even if you don't claim innocence, if you are coming forward with new evidence we want the court to hear that constitutional claim if you bring it within one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.003" offset="13579557">The reason they didn't mention it there is because it would have made the provision narrower and they didn't want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.971" offset="13599410">Then they ratcheted it up with respect to successive petitions, making you pass through the successive petition actual-innocence gateway and then comply with the limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.244" offset="13632533">So that's the explanation consistent were with legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.397" offset="13657088">I mean, they could have added a separate provision.</text>
