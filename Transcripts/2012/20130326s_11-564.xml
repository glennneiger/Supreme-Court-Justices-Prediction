            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Scalia has the opinion of the Court this morning in case 11-564, Florida versus Jardines.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="9.030" stopTime="309.240">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="9.030" offset="142545">Come out from behind these briefs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.177" offset="171175">This case is here on writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.795" offset="197611">The police received a tip that the respondent Joelis Jardines was growing marijuana in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.390" offset="235959">A surveillance team went to the home but saw nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.155" offset="251110">Two officers then took a dog trained to detect the smell of illegal drugs and approached Jardines' home.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.947" offset="286218">The dog and his handler walked up to the front porch.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.506" offset="304504">After sniffing around and going back and forth on the porch, the dog eventually sat down in front of Jardines' front door which is what he was trained to do upon finding the odor's strongest point.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.101" offset="362809">The officers then secured a search warrant using what they had learned as establishing probable cause and marijuana plants were found in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.039" offset="406591">At trial, Jardines moved to suppress that evidence arguing that when the officers brought the dog up to his door, they had searched his home without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.099" offset="458836">The trial court agreed with him, so did the Supreme Court of Florida and so do we.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.869" offset="485898">The Fourth Amendment protects the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.079" offset="526754">This case does not concern what it means for a search to be unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.301" offset="547652">Rather, the question here is more fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.333" offset="559773">What actions constitute a search?</text>
            <text syncTime="116.877" offset="573983">The basic rule is that a search occurs for Fourth Amendment purposes when the Government physically intrudes for investigative purposes on one of the areas that the amendment protects, that is, intrudes on to persons, houses, papers, or effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.422" offset="644096">Our later cases have supplemented this test but the basic approach keeps easy cases easy and by those lights, this is an easy case indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.848" offset="685787">First, there is no doubt that the officers physically intruded into an area protected by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.621" offset="716925">In our law of search and seizure, the home is first among equals.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.362" offset="739913">At the amendment's absolute core is the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from the state's gaze.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.098" offset="778888">The area immediately surrounding the home which is called the curtilage has long been regarded as part of the home itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.877" offset="813996">The police cannot without a warrant based on probable cause hang around on the lawn or in the side garden, trawling for evidence and perhaps peering into the windows of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.194" offset="863211">And the officers here had all four of their feet and all four of their companions planted firmly on that curtilage.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.131" offset="898947">The front porch is the classic example of an area intimately associated with the life of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.557" offset="928622">The only remaining question is whether Jardines had given the officers permission even implicitly to be on his porch.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.335" offset="963835">He had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.569" offset="968746">It is true that by hanging a knocker on the front door, we implicitly invite visitors including the police to approach our homes in hopes of speaking with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.333" offset="1011796">But the scope of that invitation is limited to a particular place, to a brief duration, and just as importantly to a particular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.877" offset="1057980">No one is invited to come up to the home simply to snoop around.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.697" offset="1077206">No door-to-door salesman would think himself licensed to stand on the front porch and peer into the windows.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.894" offset="1106045">And no neighbor would think it proper to slip a metal detector around the front lawn before coming to the door and asking permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.848" offset="1141885">The officers here were on the porch to gather evidence, nothing more, and we have no trouble concluding that the social norms that invite a visitor to the front door do not extend that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.514" offset="1192458">We therefore need not and do not decide whether the officers violated the reasonable expectations of privacy approach described in Katz versus United States, that the officers learned what they learned only by gathering evidence in a constitutionally protected area is enough to know that a search occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.263" offset="1275528">The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.303" offset="1287649">Justice Kagan has flied a concurring opinion in which Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.402" offset="1312099">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices Kennedy and Breyer joined.</text>
