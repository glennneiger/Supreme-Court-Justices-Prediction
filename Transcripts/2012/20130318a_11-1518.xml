            <text syncTime="6.937" offset="136121">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.872" offset="147824">This case presents one of the most confounding questions of bankruptcy law, and that is the meaning of defalcation which is found currently in Section 523(a)(4) of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.346" offset="193799">It is an undefined term in a Bankruptcy Code with more than 100 defined terms and it has been in the Bankruptcy Code or Bankruptcy Act, excuse me, since 1841 and in every version of it since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.671" offset="247089">There is no plain contemporary, ordinary meaning that we can resort to with respect to interpretation of the word because it is not in common use.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.445" offset="286168">This case presents both the question of the action required to establish defalcation and the mental state that most -- that must accompany it.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.485" offset="326292">And on the mental state issue, the circuits have split in probably three ways at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.722" offset="351265">The Eleventh Circuit here held that Petitioner committed defalcation by acting recklessly and affirmed on summary judgment, a summary judgment order that was granted for the petitioning creditor.</text>

            <text syncTime="75.748" offset="411347">Well, before we get to the various candidates for applicable mental state, if there is one, could you tell me what this mental state applies to?</text>
            <text syncTime="85.437" offset="450113">Does it apply to facts or does it apply to law?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas M. Byrne</label>
            <text syncTime="88.891" offset="463905">Your Honor, it should apply to both, but it applies -- the act must be accompanied by a culpable mental state.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.347" offset="501731">We will argue that -- and have argued that mistake of law can be relevant to the knowledge that the actor has when he commits the act, and we have argued that in this particular circumstance particularly involving dischargeability, that a mistake of law ought to be permissible in responding to the claim of defalcation.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="118.410" offset="581979">Well, what we have here is, I think everybody agrees, that these transactions were not authorized and they were self-dealing to the extent that there was a benefit to Mr. Bullock from the investments that were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.655" offset="662958">So what, in addition to being unauthorized and self-dealing, which the government tells us should be enough to make defalcation, what else other than that it was not authorized and it was self-dealing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_m_byrne" startTime="156.366" stopTime="172.745">
            <label>Mr. Thomas M. Byrne</label>
            <text syncTime="156.366" offset="733802">Your Honor, we believe that a showing of extreme recklessness at least is required as to the self-dealing, and so we have advocated for the First and Second Circuit standard, which requires either extreme recklessness or conscious misbehavior by the actor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="172.745" stopTime="197.443">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="172.745" offset="799318">But is a trustee who is taking -- borrowing against the cash value of the life insurance making an investment for the benefit of himself and his mother getting profit from that investment and not sharing it with the other siblings who are also.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.875" offset="875909">So what more than -- I mean, he did that all advertently.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_m_byrne" startTime="197.443" stopTime="262.903">
            <label>Mr. Thomas M. Byrne</label>
            <text syncTime="197.443" offset="898165">Well, Your Honor, let me go back to the question, first were -- were the loans authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.581" offset="918749">Now, this case -- the finding of defalcation here is based entirely on the two Illinois court orders in collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.687" offset="951141">And the Illinois courts specifically reserved the question of whether the loans were authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.489" offset="970367">But let me put that aside, please, and answer your second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.374" offset="985832">And what -- what sets this case apart and what -- what at least creates a factual question on whether Mr. Bullock committed defalcation was what was his -- was the overall transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.183" offset="1037136">This is a family trust, it was created by his father, involving his father's life insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.670" offset="1059079">There is uncontradicted evidence that he did not know that making a loan to his mother at his father's request would somehow run afoul of the law more than a decade later when this all came -- when this all came to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.245" offset="1113309">So we say, Your Honor, that there is at least a factual question that would have entitled him, should have entitled him to a trial on the question of the mental state that accompanied his actions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="262.903" stopTime="266.438">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="262.903" offset="1160016">But what about the two other transactions which were not done at the bidding of the father?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_m_byrne" startTime="266.438" stopTime="287.851">
            <label>Mr. Thomas M. Byrne</label>
            <text syncTime="266.438" offset="1174122">Well, Your Honor, they were done at the bidding of the mother and also they were -- they went into the family business.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.526" offset="1198469">These are two loans that went into the business created by the father and the mother, the garage building business.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.245" offset="1221352">That's where the proceeds went.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.514" offset="1226472">And so it would have been a surprise, we say, to the average person to learn that there was a legal problem with those loans.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="287.851" stopTime="307.979">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="287.851" offset="1259804">Well, I mean, it's often the case that -- that children don't want to go into the family business and it's often the case that some of them do and some of them don't and the idea that one of the children who wants to put the money back in the family business is -- you know, you wouldn't think that was wrong when the other children want to take the money out or put it somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.846" offset="1335768">That's not at all unusual.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.947" offset="1356144">But the record is very limited in this case as to what the preferences of the others were.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.323" offset="1537642">That is, I don't understand, and it's just something I don't understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.560" offset="1554570">I'm not saying it facetiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.827" offset="1559690">I don't understand the relationship of mental state to the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.064" offset="1580588">I mean, I didn't think there is any doubt here that the individual, your client, knew what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.051" offset="1604620">He knew for a fact that he was taking money from the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.103" offset="1620816">He knew he was giving it to his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.871" offset="1627817">And he knows where it's going.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.557" offset="1634609">And he knows it was later paid back with 6 percent interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.842" offset="1647775">So you don't have to assume extreme recklessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.627" offset="1658851">He knew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.777" offset="1663448">Now, what he didn't know was that that was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.446" offset="1678181">And therefore, if I look at the accompanying things -- embezzlement, larceny, fraud in the trust -- I don't think any of them require a knowledge that what you're doing is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.975" offset="1744323">So if I -- or do they?</text>
            <text syncTime="410.991" offset="1752369">I don't think -- you can be convicted of embezzlement while misunderstanding the law of embezzlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.311" offset="1773580">You can be convicted of larceny, it's saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.346" offset="1785806">And as far as I know, a person to commit fraud lies, knows it's material, knows, et cetera, but he doesn't have to know there's a law against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.702" offset="1823213">And -- and so -- if I do what Justice Harlan was doing and comparing it to the other three, it looks as if you don't need to know that what you're doing is against the law, where you commit defalcation.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.127" offset="1880891">Now, that I think is what Justice Alito was driving at.</text>

            <text syncTime="907.928" offset="3740078">But if you look with respect to defalcation at the definitions at the time, the definitions that were available in 1841 as I believe Justice Breyer has done, the -- the definitions you get are, for example, in Webster's 1828 dictionary, the act of cutting off or deducting a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.574" offset="3818655">And the origin of the defalcation exception, and I believe the amici for Respondent are correct in this respect, was the Swartwout scandal in 1838, when one Samuel Swartwout, who was the -- in charge of collections for the New York Customs House, which was a substantial part of the Federal budget at that time, was found after he departed the country to have $1.2 million missing from his accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.824" offset="3931713">And that was referred to as a defalcation at the time and it's quite reasonable to assume that's how it ended up in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3206.806" offset="12935598">And what makes this different is that this is fraud in a fiduciary capacity which was not true in the context of Neal v.

            <text syncTime="3280.671" offset="13231095">And so we think that's the heart of defalcation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.309" offset="13381665">And so if you look at the Ninth Circuit, for instance, the way it has handled this is it has recognized, as we do, that defalcation can be innocent and -- but it has, it has concluded that the essence of defalcation is the failure to account for or to produce funds, and therefore it wouldn't be something that would just be garden variety mismanagement of the assets.</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.495" offset="13922400">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.478" offset="13926266">Now, to respond to a few things said by Respondent and by the solicitor, the Petitioner actually did put into the record when he opposed summary judgment pro se in the bankruptcy court all of his evidence about what he -- what should have been done with the money that was in the constructive trust, what should have been done with the property that was in the constructive trust during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.128" offset="14024904">He put that in -- in evidence, it's in the record and his repeated pleas that the assets be sold to pay the judgment are reflected by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.918" offset="14060013">The Respondent relied entirely on the two Illinois court orders and put in no evidence other than the original pleadings, if they are evidence, in the -- in the Illinois case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.689" offset="14099092">So there is that question about the record, and Petitioner did track what -- what his efforts were to try to persuade the trustee to consent to the sale of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.331" offset="14145695">And it's interesting, the constructive trust, of course, was imposed on the properties that were acquired with loans two and three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.168" offset="14173071">So if there are any profit from the loans, they would have been caught in those properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.555" offset="14194596">And eventually, of course, they were not sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.591" offset="14202746">But to determine the amount of the loss here, a trial would be needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.309" offset="14221659">And that's really why we were hoping the Court will give us -- give Mr. Bullock a day in court here to establish under the proper legal standard what any loss really was, if there was one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.766" offset="14263455">And it was said earlier that a conflict of interest itself is a defalcation, but not if there's no loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.604" offset="14290831">That's just -- that's entirely inconsistent with the other exceptions to discharge in the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.674" offset="14315073">Mr. Gannon read the -- noted that the dictionary definitions evolved over time, but the 1856 definition of defalcation from Bouvier's Law Dictionary that's quoted in the Government's brief actually still reflects the -- the idea that -- or the definition that defalcation is the act of a defaulter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.825" offset="14423638">And a defaulter is defined as,</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.193" offset="14433146">"one who fails in making his accounts correct. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.879" offset="14443909">So by 1856, years after the first enactment of defalcation, that was still the definition that was prevailing in the day, at least according to that dictionary, and according to the others that -- that we cite earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.722" offset="14499288">Petitioner here made a mistake in judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.607" offset="14518828">There was never any finding of dishonesty on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.443" offset="14530113">There was never any finding that he acted with a malicious intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.213" offset="14549234">In fact, there was a finding that he acted with no apparent malicious intent in the Illinois courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.501" offset="14566371">This question is one of dischargeability, and his debt is really what bankruptcy is for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.152" offset="14588940">It's for a fresh start for an honest, but unfortunate debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.522" offset="14602420">Unless the Court has any further questions, that concludes my remarks.</text>
