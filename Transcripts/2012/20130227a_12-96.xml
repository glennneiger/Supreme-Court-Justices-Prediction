            <text syncTime="15.276" offset="167929">Almost 4 years ago, eight Justices of the Court agreed the 2005 25-year extension of Voting Rights Act Section 5's preclearance obligation, uniquely applicable to jurisdictions reached by Section 4(b)'s antiquated coverage formula, raised a serious constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.925" offset="270538">Those Justices recognized that the record before the Congress in 2005 made it unmistakable that the South had changed.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.705" offset="653702">Congress itself said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.074" offset="663106">But in line with Justice Sotomayor's question, in the D.C. Court of Appeals, the dissenting judge there, Judge Williams, said,</text>
            <text syncTime="155.950" offset="730607">"If this case were about three States, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama, those States have the worst records, and application of Section 5 to them might be okay. "</text>

            <text syncTime="183.702" offset="841679">He did not say, and he didn't reach the question, whether those States should be subject to preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.189" offset="867593">In other words, whether on an absolute basis, there was sufficient record to subject them--</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="194.491" offset="884834">But think about this State that you're representing, it's about a quarter black, but Alabama has no black statewide elected officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.764" offset="917957">If Congress were to write a formula that looked to the number of successful Section 2 suits per million residents, Alabama would be the number one State on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.389" offset="964455">If you factor in unpublished Section 2 suits, Alabama would be the number two State on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.645" offset="993398">If you use the number of Section 5 enforcement actions, Alabama would again be the number two State on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.414" offset="1024536">I mean, you're objecting to a formula, but under any formula that Congress could devise, it would capture Alabama.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.941" offset="1086603">Going back to Katzenbach, and all of the cases that have addressed the Voting Rights Act preclearance and the formula, they've all been addressed to determine the validity of imposing preclearance under the circumstances then prevailing, and the formula, because Shelby County is covered, not by an independent determination of Congress with respect to Shelby County, but because it falls within the formula as part of the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.843" offset="1194228">So I -- I don't think that there's any reluctance upon on this--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="277.062" offset="1215126">But facial challenges are generally disfavored in our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.616" offset="1229336">And so the question becomes, why do we strike down a formula, as Justice Kagan said, which under any circumstance the record shows the remedy would be congruent, proportional, rational, whatever standard of review we apply, its application to Alabama would happen.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bert_w_rein" startTime="301.863" stopTime="330.616">
            <label>Mr. Bert W. Rein</label>
            <text syncTime="301.863" offset="1314287">--There -- there are two separate questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.430" offset="1320556">One is whether the formula needs to be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.665" offset="1333513">In Northwest Austin, this Court addressed the formula, and the circumstances there were a very small jurisdiction, as the Court said, approaching a very big question.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.356" offset="1372278">It did the same in Rome, the City of Rome.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.891" offset="1382414">It did the same in Katzenbach.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.808" offset="1390042">The -- so the formula itself is the reason why Shelby County encounters the burdens, and it is the reason why the Court needs to address it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="330.616" stopTime="351.362">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="330.616" offset="1429330">Interestingly enough, in Katzenbach the Court didn't do what you're asking us to do, which is to look at the record of all the other States or all of the other counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.805" offset="1466110">It basically concentrated on the record of the two litigants in the case, and from that extrapolate -- extrapolated more broadly.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.116" offset="1539358">--I don't think that's a fair reading of Katzenbach.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.551" offset="1549075">In Katzenbach, what the Court did was examined whether the -- the formula was rational in practice and theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.589" offset="1581258">And what the Court said is, while we don't have evidence on every jurisdiction that's reached by the formula, that by devising two criteria which were predictive of where discrimination might lie, the Congress could then sweep in jurisdictions as to which it had no specific findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.035" offset="1655028">So we're not here to parse the jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.385" offset="1664432">We are here to challenge this formula because in and of itself it speaks to old data, it isn't probative with respect to the kinds of discrimination that Congress was focusing on and it is an inappropriate vehicle to sort out the sovereignty of individual States.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.030" offset="1734963">I could tell you that in Alabama the number of legislators in the Alabama legislature are proportionate to the number of black voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.620" offset="1765369">There's a very high registration and turnout of black voters in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.590" offset="1785222">But I don't think that that really addresses the issue of the rationality in theory and practice in the formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.178" offset="1811554">If Congress wants to write another statute, another hypothetical statute, that would present a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.731" offset="1833810">But we're here facing a county, a State that are swept in by a formula that is neither rational in theory nor in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.020" offset="1870904">That's the -- that's the hub of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1922.312" offset="7796102">There's a fundamental point that needs to be made at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.833" offset="7810208">Everyone acknowledges, Petitioner, its amici, this Court in Northwest Austin, that the Voting Rights Act made a huge difference in transforming the culture of blatantly racist vote suppression that characterized parts of this country for a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.091" offset="7867260">Section 5 preclearance was the principal engine of that progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.561" offset="7885127">And it has always been true that only a tiny fraction of submissions under Section 5 result in objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.481" offset="7912817">So that progress under Section 5 that follows from that has been as a result of the deterrence and the constraint Section 5 imposes on States and subjurisdictions and not on the actual enforcement by means of objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.058" offset="7971123">Now, when Congress faced the question whether to reauthorize Section 5 in 2006, it had to decide whether -- whether it could be confident that the attitudes and behaviors in covered jurisdictions had changed enough that that very effective constraint and deterrence could be confidently removed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.450" offset="10076696">Now, it is true, and the Petitioners raised the notion that there could be a preliminary injunction, but I really think the Petitioner's argument that Section 2 is a satisfactory and complete substitute for Section 5 rests entirely on their ability to demonstrate that preliminary injunctions can do comparable work to what Section 5 does.</text>

            <text syncTime="3203.595" offset="12921222">Justice Scalia, there's a number of things to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.697" offset="12929686">First, we are talking about the enforcement power that the Constitution gives to the Congress to make these judgments to ensure protection of fundamental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.020" offset="12982976">So this is -- this is a situation in which Congress is given a power which is expressly given to it to act upon the States in their sovereign capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.643" offset="13021428">And it cannot have been lost on the framers of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments that the power Congress was conferring on them was likely to be exercised in a differential manner because it was, the power was conferred to deal with the problems in the former States of the Confederacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.938" offset="13090600">So with respect to the constitutional grant of power, we do think it is a grant of power to Congress to make these judgments, now of course subject to review by this Court under the standard of Northwest Austin, which we agree is an appropriate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.181" offset="13143576">That's the first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.464" offset="13148696">The second point is I do -- I do say with all due respect, I think it would be extraordinary to -- to look behind the judgment of Congress as expressed in the statutory findings, and -- and evaluate the judgment of Congress on the basis of that sort of motive analysis, as opposed to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.638" offset="13293415">That deference is appropriate because of the nature of the power that has been conferred here and because, frankly, of the superior institutional competence of Congress to make these kinds of judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.345" offset="13336256">These are judgments that assess social conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.316" offset="13668115">But with all due respect, Your Honor, everyone agrees that it was appropriate for -- for Congress to have exercised this express constitutional authority when it did in 1965, and everybody agrees that it was the -- was the exercise of that authority that brought about the situation where we can now argue about whether it's still necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3524.452" offset="14204670">The first speaks to this question of whether Section 2 was adequate standing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.738" offset="14221807">As our brief demonstrates, in Alabama and in many of the covered jurisdictions, Section 2 victories often need Section 5 to realize the benefits of the -- of the ruling in the Section 2 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.082" offset="14283142">That is to say, that these measures act in tandem to protect minority communities, and we've seen it in a number of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3568.048" offset="14379064">Our brief shows that specifically in the covered jurisdictions, there is a pattern, a demonstrated pattern of Section 2 and 5 being used in tandem whereas in other jurisdictions, most of the Section 2 cases are one-off examples.</text>

            <text syncTime="3586.176" offset="14451580">Selma, Alabama in the 1990s, not in the 1960s but in the 1990s, had a series of objections and Section 2 activity and observers all that were necessary to continue to give effect to the minority inclusion principle that Section 5 was passed to vindicate in 1965.</text>

            <text syncTime="3622.700" offset="14597656">The United States brief has an appendix that points to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.384" offset="14608419">One of the recent ones was in Port Chester, New York, if memory serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.853" offset="14622316">But it's quite clear that the pattern in the covered jurisdictions is such that the repetitive nature of discrimination in those places -- take, for example, the case in LULAC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.809" offset="14658051">After this Court ruled that the redistricting plan after the 2000 round of redistricting bore the mark of intentional discrimination, in the remedial election, the State of Texas tried to shorten and constrain the early voting period for purposes of denying the Latino community of the opportunity to have the benefits of the ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.106" offset="14735269">What we've seen in Section 2 cases is that the benefits of discrimination vest in incumbents who would not be there but for the discriminatory plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.528" offset="14768915">And Congress, and specifically in the House Report, I believe it's page 57, found that Section 2 continues to be an inadequate remedy to address the problem of these successive violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.352" offset="14816249">Another example that makes this point very clearly is in the 1990s in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.888" offset="14830355">There was an important Section 2 case brought finally after 100 years to break down the dual registration system that had a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.410" offset="14864523">When Mississippi went to implement the National Voter Registration Act, it tried to bring back dual registration, and it was Section 5 -- Section 5 enforcement action that was able to knock it down.</text>

            <text syncTime="3722.898" offset="14998479">It takes cognizance of the experience, but it also looks to see what the experience has been on the ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="3942.191" offset="15875671">Yeah, but his point, I think the point is this: If you draw a red line around the States that are in, at least some of those States have a better record than some of the States that are out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.067" offset="15923109">So in 1965, well, we have history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.052" offset="15943067">We have 200 years or perhaps of slavery.</text>

            <text syncTime="3974.731" offset="16005761">So therefore Congress in 2005 looks back and says don't change horses in the middle of the stream, because we still have a ways to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.622" offset="16053304">Now the question is, is it rational to do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.106" offset="16071276">And people could differ on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.142" offset="16083397">And one thing to say is, of course this is aimed at States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4051.647" offset="16313483">The whole purpose of this act is that we made progress and Congress recognized the progress that we made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.635" offset="16337411">And, for example, they took away the examiner provision which was designed to address the registration problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.053" offset="16359041">In terms of when we are there, I think it will be some point in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.257" offset="16375864">Our great hope is that by the end of this next reauthorization we won't be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.476" offset="16392791">Indeed, there is an overlooked provision that says in 15 years, which is now 9 years from where I stand here today before you, Congress should go back and look and see if it's still necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.083" offset="16431139">So we don't think that this needs to be there in perpetuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.883" offset="16442424">But based on the record and a 2011 case in which a Federal judge in Alabama cited this Court's opinion in Northwest Austin -- there were legislators that sit today that were caught on tape referring to African American voters as illiterates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.626" offset="16497385">Their peers were referring to them as aborigines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.812" offset="16506058">And the judge, citing the Northwest Austin case -- it's the McGregor case cited in our brief -- said that, yes, the South has changed and made progress, but some things remain stubbornly the same and the trained effort to deny African American voters the franchise is part of Alabama's history to this very day.</text>

            <text syncTime="4163.819" offset="16762163">To be fair, this statute cannot go on forever, but our experience teaches that six amendments to the Constitution have had to be passed to ensure safeguards for the right to vote, and there are many Federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.793" offset="16806048">They protect uniform voters, some protect eligible voters who have not had the opportunity yet to register.</text>

            <text syncTime="4433.492" offset="17840811">But there is this difference, which I think is a key difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.427" offset="17852514">You refer to the problem as the problem identified by the tool for picking out the States, which was literacy tests, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.551" offset="17893056">But I suspect the problem was the denial or abridgement by a State of the right to vote on the basis of race and color.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.026" offset="17938927">And that test was a way of picking out places where that problem existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.013" offset="17962959">Now, if my version of the problem is the problem, it certainly is not solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.667" offset="17985529">If your version of the problem, literacy tests, is the problem, well, you have a much stronger case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4482.808" offset="18038087">--I think you look at Katzenbach and you look at the evidence within the four corners of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.711" offset="18057731">It responds to limited registration and voting as measured and the use of devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.765" offset="18077898">The devices are gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.815" offset="18082078">That problem has been resolved by the Congress definitively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.151" offset="18095452">So it can't be the basis for further -- further legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.203" offset="18111648">I think what we are talking about here is that Congress looks and says, well, we did solve that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.859" offset="18138293">As everyone agrees, it's been very effective, Section 5 has done its work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.844" offset="18154280">People are registering and voting and, coming to Justice Scalia's point, Senators who see that a very large group in the population has politically wedded themselves to Section 5 are not going to vote against it; it will do them no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.753" offset="18209869">And so I think, Justice Scalia, that evidence that everybody votes for it would suggest some of the efficacy of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.157" offset="18235469">You have a different constituency from the constituency you had in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.961" offset="18254695">But coming to the point, then if you think there is discrimination, you have to examine that nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.298" offset="18280086">They didn't look at some of the problems of dilution and the like because they would have found them all over the place in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.552" offset="18309029">But they weren't responding to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.238" offset="18315821">They were responding to an acute situation where people could not register and vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.540" offset="18333062">There was intentional denial of the rights under the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
