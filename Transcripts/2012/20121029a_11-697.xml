            <text syncTime="22.761" offset="197435">Our definition is the more consistent with the English language, and is the only definition that does not do mischief with the same use of that phrase each time it's repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.652" offset="241007">Ours is the only one consistent with a 400-year common law history, and 65-year-old right that was in the statute through 1976, and consistent with the principle that Congress doesn't abolish those things without being clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.214" offset="311224">Ours gives the copyright owners much of what they asked for when they were seeking an importation provision, just not everything; whereas, Wiley's grants them rights far beyond anything that anyone could have imagined asking for back then.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.541" offset="784563">Your Honor, I have a few answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.791" offset="793549">The first is it is not true that no country adopts national exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.278" offset="811521">Congress adopted national exhaustion in sections 905 and 906 6 years after the statute was passed, as to microchips.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.717" offset="849242">But second, Wiley is making the point that there is now a norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.003" offset="866378">They say most States -- most countries, that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.239" offset="879335">Back in 1976 Wiley is not even arguing that there was any international norm, much less that the drafters of the statute were focused on international norms; and the truth is that there isn't an international consensus around national exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.118" offset="950806">We know that for a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.951" offset="958225">In 1994 when 125 nations got together, they -- they agreed to disagree on international copyright exhaustion principles, and they codified that disagreement, to each his own, in the TRIPS agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.374" offset="1203880">And -- and the point here is we've got to of course read what Congress wrote.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.169" offset="1983061">And Your Honor, the reason was -- what was driving copyright owners crazy was this notion that there were lawless states out there that had no significant copyright protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.576" offset="2024648">And we were applying their standards to products that were infiltrating the U.S. market.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.111" offset="2046800">And one of the most important things to underscore here, which I think got lost in the Costco argument, is that the space -- that 602 does an enormous amount of work even with 109, the first-sale doctrine, carved out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.657" offset="2108971">Copyright owners wanted three things out of the 1976 act with respect to importation, and they got two and a half of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.215" offset="2159231">It was driving them crazy that there were lawless states out there; they gave the example of Russia, which -- where an agency approved the making and distribution within Russia of classic English language works.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.224" offset="2219312">They got imported to the U.S. and they were competing with U.S. works, U.S. copies within our domestic market.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.013" offset="2254421">And they got their wish to shut that down, to use U.S. law as the standard for those works.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.650" offset="2280961">Secondly, they got coverage for copies that were lawfully made but stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.971" offset="2306248">And this was the one ask that the film industry had.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.190" offset="2319100">We see it in the colloquies.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.458" offset="2328191">They rented films abroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.092" offset="2346790">The films would get stolen; and the U.S. market would be awash with stolen films.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.730" offset="2369255">And so they wanted to shut down with the importation provision those stolen goods coming into the U.S. market.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.602" offset="2404782">And the third thing that they wanted is -- is what's been dominating this debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.239" offset="2423276">But it's only the third thing, and that was help dividing geographic markets, so that they could go after the rogue distributors, yes, but also go after the downstream sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.797" offset="2469565">They got half of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.230" offset="2475312">They got a cause of action against the rogue distributors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1024.559" offset="4204618">It was that conversation between Clark and Goldman, who was the general counsel of the copyright office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.081" offset="4238682">It's on pages 11 to 12 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.847" offset="4249758">It's recited in extensive detail in the amicus brief that Costco submitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.103" offset="4278806">They got their importation provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1047.971" offset="4298241">You have got this importation provision, and you've got this First Sale Doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1060.481" offset="4348292">And what they do, the general counsel of the copyright office says, we obviously haven't thought this through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.634" offset="4372951">We need to do more work on this, says the librarian of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.336" offset="4387684">And the next thing that happens, you see it in a red line on page 13 of our reply brief, is that for the first time in the drafting history, the two are reconciled by making 602 subordinate to 109, in exactly the way that Quality King found it to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.992" offset="6482391">This Court unanimously recognized in the Quality King case that 602(a)(1) encompasses copies of books that were lawfully made not under the United States' Copyright Act, but under the law of some other country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.469" offset="6552295">602(a) is broader than 6 -- 109(a), because it encompasses copies not subject to the first-sale doctrine, for example copies made under the law of another country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.633" offset="6632857">Now, referring to it as dicta misstates what was going on, on the Quality King case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.771" offset="6657412">The argument was that if you interpret 602(a) and 109(a) as allowing a defense, a first-sale defense, you emasculate Section 602(a), and so the Court was explaining on page 147 and 148, I believe, why there were three reasons why 602(a) would have viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.671" offset="6761066">And one of those reasons had to do with direct action against someone that was engaged in pirating, and some of it had to do with bailees and lessees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2662.846" offset="10757800">It only makes sense to interpret it this way if you allow segmentation of the market pursuant to these provisions, because it is exhausting the copyright under the laws of the United States once you make a sale of a product produced in the United States subject to the United States' copyright laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.374" offset="10827913">You are not exhausting your U.S. copyright when you make something, or allow something to be made abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.545" offset="10852573">You are not exhausting that copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.814" offset="10861663">You have not done that yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.266" offset="10867410">So the first sale is not something that happens abroad that uses up the copyright laws -- of the protection under the copyright laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.872" offset="10909833">So it seems to me that this does make perfect sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.406" offset="10924044">And it makes -- there is not going to be a perfect solution in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.810" offset="10941598">The Court has dealt with that frequently with respect to copyright laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.179" offset="10955077">But if you interpret it as my opponent interprets it, you are opening the door to commercial enterprises precisely like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.701" offset="10985170">It's not necessary in this case to decide every single permutation of a problem that someone crosses a border with a product, but this section 602 specifically contemplates products that are acquired abroad and then brought back into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.128" offset="11050894">Here, we have a commercial enterprise doing exactly what is contemplated by the people who were talking about 602(a) and section 109 when the two were adopted at the same time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.134" offset="11494871">I think there are two related reasons, and one of them is the dictum, but I'll get to that second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.253" offset="11511381">I think in both cases, our overriding objective was to offer a reading of section 109(a) that would not supersede, or would not effectively negate the implication prohibition in section 602(a)(1), because from the Copyright Office's perspective, we agree with Mr. Olson that the primary reason for the enactment of 602(a)(1) was to facilitate market segmentation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.903" offset="12245944">That is, Bobbs-Merrill was a 1908 case in which the publisher sold books to retailers on the proviso that they not be sold at retail for less than a specified amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.127" offset="12286904">One of the retailers violated that resale restriction and was sued for copyright infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.079" offset="12306653">And this Court in Bobbs-Merrill said -- parsed the statutory language, which at that time gave the copyright owner the exclusive right to vend copies of the work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.470" offset="12344269">But you're saying Bobbs-Merrill means something beyond section 109, but when -- the 1909 Copyright Act said that it was codifying the holding in Bobbs-Merrill, and the 1976 statute which is now before us said it wasn't changing the meaning of the earlier law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.515" offset="12420442">So I don't know how -- Bobbs-Merrill wasn't a constitutional decision, it was a question of statutory interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3088.038" offset="12458476">Maybe I can put it this way: If I buy a piratical copy of a book, one that was illegally made without the consent of the copyright owner, and all I do is read it and put it on my shelf, I can't rely on 109(a) because the copy was not lawfully made under this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.832" offset="12521693">But I still couldn't be held liable for copyright infringement because there is no exclusive right to read the book or to own it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.986" offset="12546352">I wouldn't have been infringing any of the copyright owner's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.371" offset="12559831">And so in order to have a valid claim for copyright infringement, the copyright holder would have to show both that 109(a) was inapplicable, and that what the defendant was doing was a violation, an infringement of one of the exclusive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.281" offset="12615524">And Mr. Rosenkranz seems to postulate a situation in which a cagey manufacturer would locate its facilities overseas, make the copies there, import them into the United States, sell them in this country, subject to conditions on resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.040" offset="12674561">And if the goods were resold in violation of those restrictions, the copyright owner would sue for infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.778" offset="12701520">And I think the first argument the defendant would make is that is exactly the conduct that the Court in Bobbs-Merrill said did not infringe the exclusive right to vend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.217" offset="12739240">Now -- namely the resale in violation of restrictions on resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.538" offset="12756481">How can you now say it's now an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute?</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.656" offset="12772991">And it would be a particularly difficult argument for the copyright owner to make because what the House Report said in 1909, it didn't say exactly that it was codifying the holding of Bobbs-Merrill; it said that it was amending the statute in other respects, and it wanted to make clear that there was no intent to enlarge the exclusive right to vend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.551" offset="12848537">And so the Plaintiff, in Mr. Rosenkranz's hypothetical, would in effect be arguing that by codifying section 109(a), Congress had implicitly expanded the scope of the implicit -- of the exclusive right to vend or distribute, even though it said it was doing the various opposite.</text>

            <text syncTime="3316.871" offset="13373807">And the first is that Coke was saying that, in most circumstances at least, a sale is sufficient in order to divest the owner of his prior right to control distribution, but it doesn't say that a sale is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.679" offset="13421036">And my point is that when Mr. Rosenkranz says the hypothetical foreign publisher who makes copies with authorization but ships it into the -- them into the United States without could be held liable for infringement, there is nothing in section 109(a) that would allow a court to draw that distinction; that is, although 109(a) is sometimes referred to as a codification of the First Sale Doctrine, it doesn't require an antecedent first sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.877" offset="13521869">So as long as the foreign publisher was the owner of the books at the type -- time they were manufactured, if those books were lawfully made under this title, under Petitioner's reading they could be imported and distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.185" offset="13571084">We know also that this was not an oversight, that Congress didn't intend the provision to be subject to a sort of implicit first authorized sale requirement, because the language was intended to cover copies that were made pursuant to a compulsory license.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Joshua Rosenkranz</label>
            <text syncTime="3446.589" offset="13892703">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.006" offset="13898346">I just want to step back and take a look at what the government's doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.827" offset="13917676">After eloquently arguing in Quality King in the last two pages of its brief that our position on the meaning of this language is right, it's saying our position is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.265" offset="13959472">And then, it's trying to come up with a middle ground that has absolutely no basis in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.038" offset="13986535">If Bobbs-Merrill provides the content for the First Sale Doctrine, then what does section 109 do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.358" offset="14011822">And so the government is creating a scenario in which, in order to save 602 from being superfluous in the way it is described, although we believe it's not superfluous at all, it is making 109 superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.452" offset="14072217">Justice Kagan asked a question about essentially sentence diagramming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.856" offset="14093846">Our view is that under this title modifies lawfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.890" offset="14113908">You use the U.S. metric of U.S. law to figure out whether it's lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.144" offset="14134911">The government's and Wiley's position is that under this title modifies both made and lawfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.500" offset="14172422">And at least the way I learned grammar, you can't use the same phrase to modify both terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.821" offset="14193634">I want to correct something that I said to Justice Ginsburg because I said it backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.791" offset="14213487">905 and 906 are examples of the United States Congress in a copyright context applying national exhaustion, and that was six years after this statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.634" offset="14268866">To Justice Breyer's question, the bear is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.086" offset="14286734">It is very much there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.871" offset="14293840">The only reason no one has ever pursued these legal arguments is that the legal arguments that are the baseline for all of this have yet to be accepted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.060" offset="14338561">But I have not heard any argument for why the vast majority of them will not necessarily obtain, and they are not in any of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.468" offset="14376282">To use the Toyota example, there simply is no other defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.987" offset="14394359">There is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.670" offset="14397075">Fair use doesn't apply to the vast majority of the scenarios that I've just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.058" offset="14418600">Finally, outsourcing: Congress did not want U.S. jobs to go overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.246" offset="14455381">Congress in the very same statute in section 601 was hoarding manufacturing jobs to the United States; and as the government said on the last page of its Quality King,</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.971" offset="14498222">"it is highly unlikely that the same Congress that hoarded jobs in the United States was prepared to tolerate a situation in which there was eternal downstream control. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.945" offset="14542107">that the copyright owners would be encouraged to seize by sending jobs overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.349" offset="14567812">So unless there are further questions from the Court -- I saw, I just realized I said the same thing twice incorrectly to Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.371" offset="14603861">905 and 906 are examples of international exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.942" offset="14638133">Unless there are further questions, I thank the Court and respectfully request that the Court reverse the judgment below.</text>
