            <text syncTime="134.317" offset="643520">And what this Court said in Stewart is that capable means practically capable, not theoretically capable.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.888" offset="665881">There's a range of how broad the word capable can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.340" offset="679674">And again, going back over a century, every single time this Court's been confronted with that question, it's used the term function to describe whether or not something is practically capable of carrying people or things over water.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.869" offset="857724">And this district court decision, Sea Village Marina, cited many, many cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="203.544" offset="920418">Justice Ginsburg, I think there's a confusion of terminology that I hope I can -- that I hope I can straighten out at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.150" offset="950929">The term floating home is generally described to mean a residence that is designed to sit still and is not designed to carry people or things over water.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.138" offset="982798">The term houseboat is something that is self-propelled, generally moves people or things over water.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.458" offset="1012160">What happened in the Sea Village Marina case, to my understanding, is the Court simply used the wrong term.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.744" offset="1029296">It cited a lot of cases that held that houseboats, as we describe a houseboat as something that is designed to move its owner and the owner's things from here to there, are vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.067" offset="1074540">And we don't dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.003" offset="1078302">But on the other hand, you have something called floating homes, which the brief filed by the Seattle and Sausalito floating homes associations give a very thorough description of what a floating home is and how it's different.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.442" offset="1124069">And a primary way that it's different is that, as opposed to a houseboat, which is doing its function, it's doing its job when it's moving things from place to place, a floating home can't function when it's out in the water being towed.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.535" offset="1176418">None of the utilities work, none of the power, no equipment is aboard to do anything--</text>

            <text syncTime="280.277" offset="1227409">Now, the facts are in dispute, and we're not quite clear of the facts, but let's assume that this magnificent structure is -- which was mercifully destroyed -- let's assume that it was attached to the dock by a rope, a garden hose and an extension cord, and that it could leave within 30 minutes notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.648" offset="1348826">Is that indefinitely moored?</text>
            <text syncTime="313.231" offset="1359171">And if the answer is yes, is that because of subjective intent of the owner?</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.187" offset="12735079">And the reason why is because as this court recognized in Stewart, the in navigation requirement is something that has been used for limiting the reach of Jones Act seamen in those circumstances in which a vessel is taken out of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.799" offset="12801430">So I think that it would be appropriate in a case like this where this is a classic instance of a maritime lien, dockage--</text>

            <text syncTime="3185.389" offset="12847824">But -- and in fact, I think the question of who is a Jones Act seaman is a different test that this Court last discussed in the Chandris case in terms of its substantial connection to the mission of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.882" offset="12905816">And that -- I think that the Court could safely leave the Jones Act issues aside, because they bring in an entirely different regime that focuses on the worker's connection to the vessel as opposed to the definition of vessel itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.042" offset="12962449">The definition of vessel itself here is, as Justice Scalia pointed out, part of the Dictionary Act, and it is something that does apply more broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.815" offset="13001528">But as we briefed in this case, there are two provisions that take that definition and then they add an intent requirement as specific language in different parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.603" offset="13040712">So that if that idea, function, or intent or purpose is something that is germane to that particular statutory function, than that is a question that becomes a question for jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.478" offset="13084180">But I'd also like to point out that both, I think, the district court and the court of appeals here assumed that there was jurisdiction here because there had not been evidence that contested the basic principles that the City brought when it filed this in rem action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.357" offset="13151680">And because the case then moved into the merits phase, the district judge here initially denied the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction without prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.212" offset="13191177">And then as the evidence came in, revisited the question to provide a fuller explanation, and at that time made the ruling that Mr. Lozman had not put in record evidence that affected the practical capability of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.822" offset="13253558">The only thing Mr. Lozman argued in the court of appeals as a reason for error was that because he intended to live there indefinitely, even though he had no contractual or property right to do so, and he had signed a wet slip agreement that provided the marina complete discretion to move his houseboat within any of the slips, or to order of the houseboat to leave on 3 days' notice, the question of whether or not there was any record of evidence on practical capability got to the Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit, in applying a practical capability test, said the things that Mr. Lozman had argued, he didn't offer record evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.299" offset="13411442">So, Justice Kennedy, to your point, I think that with respect to the Court of Appeals and how it did do its job is an important facet of the case as it comes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.738" offset="13445192">They initially asked you in the cert petition to grant cert because the Fifth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit have implied an onerous intent test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.325" offset="13475598">They've not defended that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.427" offset="13483958">And it is abjectly erroneous because you can't have vessel status be so easily manipulated by an individual's intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.532" offset="13516454">And now by trying to morph it into some kind of function or objective purpose standard, they've essentially done exactly what the Eleventh Circuit said they had offered no evidence in the district court to try to prove.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.696" offset="13605061">I think Mr. Frederick's best argument that I've heard, and some of this Court has echoed it, is that this is a vessel because it was moved around and it carried his personal effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.319" offset="13643514">The difficulty is that argument runs absolutely headlong into Evansville and Roper; it cannot be squared with those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.991" offset="13674234">And I would be willing to rest my entire case on simply this Court reading and applying those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.478" offset="13696176">In Evansville, this Court dealt with something that carried around the effects of a business office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.882" offset="13717806">In Roper, this Court dealt with something that carried around grain and was far more seaworthy than the structure in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.351" offset="13739644">Both instances, the Court said they're not vessels because the function was not to carry those things around, it was merely -- they were merely incidental relocations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.559" offset="13776529">Now -- so for that reason, the Eleventh Circuit simply cannot be right when it says that function is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.296" offset="13803487">And the City can't be right on its test either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.331" offset="13815608">The only way the City has proposed to deal with those cases is to look at how securely the structure is fashioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.984" offset="13842253">And Justice Kagan, you're exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.436" offset="13848000">If you want a recipe for disaster on jurisdictional questions, start asking whether it's chains or ropes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.590" offset="13872660">And not only that, if you want something that's utterly manipulable, tell the yacht owner who has his yacht down in the harbor that all he has to do is hook it up to the dock with chains instead of ropes and now he's out of maritime jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.648" offset="13924905">So this Court's cases for almost a century have applied the exact test we're asking this Court to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.969" offset="13950191">And even if you're not 100 percent persuaded that that's what the statute is best read as doing, that is what we have done for over 100 years, and that is how maritime law has built up and guaranteed on those -- on those understandings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.847" offset="14013721">And it's not just the questions we have been talking today -- it's employment law, tort law, all the rest are built on this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.334" offset="14039634">And we're asking this Court simply to reaffirm what it has done in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.303" offset="14055517">So I think that leaves the question of, when you know the Eleventh Circuit applied the wrong test and you know the City's test can't be right, do you vacate or do you simply reverse?</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.909" offset="14093969">And we think -- Justice Kennedy, we think that you can simply reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.713" offset="14109120">You have everything in the record you need, most notably in the surveyor's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.665" offset="14124898">And you can look at four things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.117" offset="14130749">Look at the -- look at the materials used, the shape of the structure, its equipment and the utilities.</text>
