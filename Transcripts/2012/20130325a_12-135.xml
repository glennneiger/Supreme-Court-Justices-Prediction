            <text syncTime="3305.826" offset="13330358">It was Oxford's interpretation of its own clause that the arbitrator relied upon, which puts this case completely outside of Stolt-Nielsen, where in Stolt-Nielsen, the arbitrator fashioned his -- their own rules based on some policy preference about class actions which wasn't present here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3464.778" offset="13966179">"Tellingly, Sutter resorts in part to misrepresenting Oxford's previous positions. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.415" offset="14088641">But we know that as of this Court's decision in Stolt-Nielsen, because this was reported in the AAA amicus brief, that not a single final decision had been rendered prior to -- as of the time of Stolt-Nielsen, in any class arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.759" offset="14154051">The AAA class arbitration rules were adopted after this Court's decision in Bazzle, which left open the possibility, a possibility that the arbitrator in this case said was surprising, because the arbitrator said quite correctly that everyone expected that in Bazzle this Court would say there's no such thing as class arbitration.</text>
