            <text syncTime="1517.960" offset="6177267">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.579" offset="6195761">This trial here was ended before verdict from a jury on the motion of the defendant, opposed vigorously by the prosecution, alleging essentially that the crime charged contained an uncharged element on which insufficient proof had been presented for a rational factfinder to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; that uncharged element being that the offense be, for want of a better term, of a -- excuse me -- the structure be for want of a better term, a non-dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.002" offset="6333374">We had -- that had not been alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.035" offset="6337554">But it has been conceded throughout the appellate history of this case, from the Michigan Court of Appeals on, that there is no such element in -- in the -- in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.275" offset="6374543">The statute that Mr. Moran mentioned that refers to the next preceding section over 3 decades ago was held to be words of limitation; in other words, you don't have to prove it's a dwelling to prove that other real property, a building or other real property has been burned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.669" offset="6440058">So in the 1970s it was held the difference between the two statutes is the greater requires proof of a dwelling or a habitation; the lesser does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.608" offset="6479869">The judge held that you have to prove the negative of the element that enhances the offense in order to prove the lesser offense; you have to prove it's a non-dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.548" offset="6511634">And again, that has been conceded to be error throughout the entire appellate history here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.650" offset="6528039">And so the proofs were adequate, were appropriate here, and the charging document was appropriate here; and the question becomes on these facts, does termination of the trial by the judge constitute an acquittal so that jeopardy should bar a second trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.294" offset="6594599">The Jeopardy Clause is aimed at prohibiting certain governmental abuses that occurred historically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.317" offset="6634723">One of them is when the government would terminate a trial that was not going well, without the consent of the defendant, in order to take another shot at it, to build a better case or perhaps get a better factfinder; and the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits that kind of conduct by establishing through this Court's cases that mistrials without the consent of the defendant bar retrial; that abhorrent practice is barred unless a manifest necessity is shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.115" offset="6737854">And we have even extended that to the circumstance that if the judge is intending to help the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.169" offset="6754050">If he is doing something that he believes is in defendant's favor, if defendant has not consented, then that valued right to a verdict from the tribunal that he is before trumps everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.375" offset="6798876">But if there is consent, as there was in this case -- the defendant asked the judge to terminate the trial without going to this jury, so he gave up his valued right to a decision by this tribunal -- if he does that, then that -- the other side of that coin is, that is ordinarily outcome-determinative the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.689" offset="6876199">A retrial is permissible unless the government has achieved the first harm by the back door, that is by goading the defendant into the mistrial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.208" offset="10070243">--A verdict is a verdict, I agree with Mr. Moran.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.778" offset="10084558">When the judge on the merits returns a verdict, what the judge does or the jury does in returning a verdict on the merits is very different than what the judge does on a judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.699" offset="10116218">The jury weighs credibility and assesses the weight of evidence, and the judge is prohibited from doing those things, is supposed to be by the law in making his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.205" offset="10146207">His is the ruling of law as gatekeeper that -- that we won't even reach this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.109" offset="10165851">The jury is expressing its opinion based on the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.775" offset="10176509">And although it can be proven that they've reached a result contrary to reality, they can't be right or wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.548" offset="10203572">Legally, their opinion is their opinion of those 12 collective people after doing something the judge isn't allowed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.285" offset="10226560">So the directed verdict isn't, I don't think, a perfect analog to the jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.404" offset="10243069">But the bench trial issue gets very complicated because it is possible to do something with a bench trial that we don't do with jury trials, and that is have specific factfinding as to the elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.359" offset="10278805">Many jurisdictions do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.559" offset="10283611">There is, in fact, a case -- the Lynch case that Mr. Moran cited, where, on rehearing en banc, the court split evenly as to whether or not the judge's verdict, where the judge had actually specifically found all of the elements -- crime is elements A, B, and C, I find them; I don't find element B, so I acquit -- the court split five to five on rehearing en banc and whether or not that judge had really announced two verdicts and it could be reformed -- be reformed to a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.446" offset="10391236">And Justice Sotomayor was one of the members of the five who would have addressed the question of: Is that not different?</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.664" offset="10412029">The form of the language doesn't control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.515" offset="10419448">Has not the judge actually entered a guilty verdict in that circumstance?</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.567" offset="10435644">That's a very, you know, kind of off-the-beaten-track kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.455" offset="10455288">In a jury trial where a judge simply takes the case from the jury on the motion of the defendant and resolves the fact that the legislature has not said that one needs to be proven, that is not one of the constituent parts of the crime, that is not something that need be proven to impose punishment under the law, then he's done something very different than what the jury has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.417" offset="10527072">And to reverse that and allow the prosecution to have one full and fair opportunity we believe imposes no cruelty or oppression upon the defendant.</text>

            <label>Mr. Curtis E. Gannon</label>
            <text syncTime="2628.365" offset="10618919">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.567" offset="10627696">We believe the Court can resolve this case by distinguishing between the misconstruction of an element and the erroneous addition of an element to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.804" offset="10660610">But if the Court's unwilling to draw that particular distinction, it could also resolve the case by allowing the government to appeal in both of those instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.927" offset="10689136">This goes to the question that Justice Kagan was asking near the end of my friend's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.529" offset="10703556">We don't think that that would require overruling any of the Court's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.664" offset="10720065">We think it would require narrowing Smalis and Rumsey to their facts, and -- but Smith would not be a problem in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.038" offset="10757577">Rumsey is distinct for the reason that my friend suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.907" offset="10769071">It was actually a case involving factfindings by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.459" offset="10783281">The Court characterized it as a special verdict made by the sole decisionmaker there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.061" offset="10801671">It was not an instance like this, where the judge had taken the case away as a matter of law from the jury because there wouldn't be any sufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.833" offset="10832705">It has been cited later on in this cases, in particular in Smalis, as being about something like a sufficiency decision, but on its facts, that is not what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.106" offset="10865828">Smith is about a completely separate question because there is no dispute there about the appropriate construction of the element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.943" offset="10897175">The firearms offense there, the element in question was whether the barrel length was less than 13 inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.032" offset="10921521">There was a question about whether certain evidence that the firearm in question was a pistol was sufficient to satisfy that burden, but there was no doubt about what the -- what the element was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.071" offset="10961750">It was 13 inches or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.571" offset="10967706">And so it wasn't about misconstruing the element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.190" offset="10978155">Smalis is probably the hardest case in this context, but if you look at what actually happened in Smalis and what was at issue in the demurrer there, the decision that the Court was reviewing was one that was principally about whether there was sufficient evidence of causation which was an undisputed element of each of the counts at issue there, and only in footnote 7 of the Court's opinion did it address potential misconstruction of the element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.407" offset="11075017">And it was a different element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.507" offset="11083480">This was what my -- my friend Mr. Moran mentioned--</text>

            <text syncTime="2748.242" offset="11098422">My basic question: Normally, a judge will wait till the jury comes in and then decide, if the jury convicts him, whether to set it aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.767" offset="11140532">So there's no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.933" offset="11145129">So now we have the judge -- for one reason or other, this judge has decided to grant the motion of acquittal in the middle of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.106" offset="11173864">Now, this is unusual, I think -- I hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.641" offset="11187970">And if so, though, the judge might not think of writing down his reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.979" offset="11209286">So he might just say there isn't enough evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.914" offset="11221093">And now it happens that, just before he did that, the defense lawyer argued to him an erroneous theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3117.396" offset="12574968">And so it -- it is not uncommon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.765" offset="12588447">I mean, this particular type of error that we have in this case we think is the most egregious kind, the non-existent element error, which the Government had also pointed out in its amicus brief in Smalis, we think is the most egregious kind of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.875" offset="12644871">It's one that demonstrates that the court is engaging in -- it's usurping the province of the legislature in redefining the scope of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.945" offset="12677159">And we think, under the terms of the Double Jeopardy Clause itself, which talks about whether there's been -- somebody's been subject to being twice in jeopardy for the same offense -- then it -- it matters what the offense was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.438" offset="12731180">And when the judge has redefined the -- the crime so extensively that the indictment literally would have been invalid and could have been dismissed as not adequately alleging the elements of the offense, and we know that that is something the Government would have been able to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.416" offset="12803069">We also know that the Government would be able to appeal if the judge had reserved decision until after the jury had returned a jury -- a guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.089" offset="12833789">We acknowledge, as the State does, that jury verdicts are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.040" offset="12853538">If a jury is mis-instructed and a jury returns an acquittal, that we are not quarrelling with that in any way; we don't think there's any purchase in the Court's case law to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.646" offset="12888019">And I think one of the reasons is because the jury verdict might be attributable not just to mistake or error, but also to lenity or compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.435" offset="12923128">There -- there are lots of reasons why we don't exactly know why a jury did what it did, and why juries generally enter general verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.073" offset="12949668">And that makes it different from what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.441" offset="12959177">We have here an instance where the court, as a matter of law, at the defendant's behest, took the case away from the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3251.583" offset="13111732">I do characterize Rumsey as an additional element case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.887" offset="13128973">And I also characterize it as a misconstrued element case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.606" offset="13143810">It's a perfect example of how these cases can be construed either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.224" offset="13162305">The judge required a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.243" offset="13170351">You can call that an additional element to the aggravating circumstance, or you can call it as a misconstruction of what pecuniary gain means in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.431" offset="13199190">The same here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.515" offset="13203474">The error here can be construed as a misconstruction of the element that the property burned has to be a building, and the judge says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.371" offset="13234925">"Looking at the statute, I construe that to mean a particular type of building. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.656" offset="13248091">Or it can be, as the prosecution construed it, as the addition of an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.060" offset="13269616">There is no difference between the two characterizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.810" offset="13280692">Turning to the -- the broader question about this whole line of cases, and should this Court go back and revisit this whole line of cases, is there really a problem here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.516" offset="13315487">We have no amicus briefs from any states indicating that there's a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.987" offset="13333355">We have only the amicus from the United States saying that there's a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.621" offset="13347879">Is there a problem here that justifies going back and revisiting 50 years, or possibly 108 years, all the way back to Kepner -- all of this case law?</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.727" offset="13384346">We submit not, especially since as this Court noted just six years ago in Smith, there is an easy solution if there really is a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.750" offset="13416424">If there really is a problem with judges going wild and granting directed verdicts mid-trial for no apparent reason, all that has to be done is the states can fall into that, as we can say judges can't do that, or judges as an intermediate -- states as an intermediate step could at least give judges the power to reserve that decision--</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.529" offset="13599490">Namely, preserve the State's resources, preserve the jury's time, and present -- prevent the defendant from having to go through a trial that is going nowhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.868" offset="13628852">And so there are good reasons why States don't do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.820" offset="13640659">States have apparently made the decision, even after being alerted in Smith that there's something they can do about it, that the good of giving judges this mid-trial directed verdict acquittal power outweighs the bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.794" offset="13688620">Finally, I'd just like to respond to Mr. Baughman's point, and it was also raised by Mr. Gannon, about how jury verdicts are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.048" offset="13717564">There's something special about jury verdicts, because we don't always know why they granted the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.268" offset="13738462">But we have the same problem with judicial directed verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.904" offset="13752986">And we have Martin Linen, where the judge just says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.139" offset="13761972">"This is the weakest case I have ever seen. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.374" offset="13770958">We have Smalis, where he just says it's legally insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.576" offset="13783706">If the Court adopts the line that the prosecution and the Solicitor General would have you adopt, you're going to have to require judges to give very specific findings as to what the elements of the offense are, and which ones that they don't find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.419" offset="13839085">And that itself would require a radical reworking of this Court's jurisprudence.</text>
