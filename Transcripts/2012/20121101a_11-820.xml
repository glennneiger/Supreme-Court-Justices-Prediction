            <text syncTime="8.587" offset="140274">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.272" offset="151036">In the more than 20 years since this Court decided Teague v. Lane, it's had more than a dozen cases in which people have sought habeas relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel, but this Court has never once held that applying Strickland in those divergent actual settings constituted a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.067" offset="214252">For two reasons, this Court should reject the government's argument to do so for the first time here.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.702" offset="232747">First, Padilla was dictated by precedent; that is, like other Strickland cases that came before it, this Court in Padilla simply applied Strickland's formula of assessing attorney performance according to prevailing professional norms to a new set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.045" offset="294083">The second--</text>

            <text syncTime="47.981" offset="297844">It's a surprise to the, what, ten courts of appeals who came out the other way?</text>

            <text syncTime="53.885" offset="321459">Two -- two things about the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.635" offset="328460">The first is, there are only three lower court decisions that postdate the 1996 act that the government can cite that came out the other way in terms of the question presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.359" offset="375376">And the second thing is, even within those cases and within those courts, they didn't distinguish between deportation advice and other kinds of advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.064" offset="414246">They distinguished between acts and omissions; that is to say, it was a uniform rule in the lower courts at the time this Court decided Padilla that misadvice concerning the right to -- I'm sorry, concerning deportation consequences of a plea did violate Strickland.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.824" offset="473283">So the distinction in lower courts was not between deportation advice and other kinds of advice; the distinction was between acts and omissions.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.980" offset="725834">Now, remember, Justice Ginsburg, the Court did not extend Strickland to collateral consequences in Padilla.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.384" offset="747464">It actually reserved that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.101" offset="754360">What it held is that deportation consequences are not removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.538" offset="776094">So, remember, Strickland--</text>

            <text syncTime="180.213" offset="826772">What this Court held in Padilla -- and this is the second to last sentence in part two -- is that advice concerning deportation consequences of a guilty plea are not categorically removed from the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.837" offset="869299">So what I understood the Court to do in Padilla was take the ordinary Strickland formula of prevailing professional norms and simply apply it to this criminal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.921" offset="977655">The question this Court asked under Teague is whether it broke new ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.357" offset="991343">And I think what this Court said in Padilla is, we reject the artificial restriction on Strickland that the lower courts have created; so, therefore, this Court simply reaffirmed Strickland.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.366" offset="1051425">I mean, assume that you have these ten circuit courts all going in the way that the Chief Justice said, and then one court came along and said, you know, we think that they -- in an AEDPA context, a habeas consideration of a state conviction -- we think that this is all wrong, and, in fact, the law is exactly the opposite of what ten circuits have held.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.516" offset="1152048">Wouldn't we think that that's a very easy case that the AEDPA standard had not been met?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="266.987" offset="1173887">--I think you -- you may well find that, Justice Kagan, but the reason why is because you'd find that there was not an unreasonable application of preexisting law.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.426" offset="1207637">What you would not say is that the clearly established law is any different.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.295" offset="1223101">So, remember, this Court -- this case, because it's a Federal case, raises only the first question under AEDPA, in a sense, which is what's the clearly established law?</text>
            <text syncTime="286.984" offset="1253926">And this is the Chief -- I think this is responsive to the Chief Justice's question about the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.853" offset="1269390">There was a disagreement on this Court about how to apply Strickland, but the question's whether a new legal rule was created, not whether there was an unreasonable application--</text>

            <text syncTime="300.642" offset="1308470">I mean, you could say that about any principle of law that we rely on: The dissent thought that that principle applied a different way here.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.897" offset="1337518">What is different about Strickland that it enables you to appeal to that, as opposed to appealing to any principle of law?</text>

            <text syncTime="390.818" offset="1669273">Could -- if there was an evolution of the law of adequate assistance of counsel so that this Court later held, oh, conditions of confinement have to be a part of the attorney's skill and competence in representation, that that would be retroactive?</text>

            <text syncTime="689.858" offset="2865368">And I think that's the second answer I wanted to give to your question about this so-called threshold question in Padilla, is that even if there is some question as to whether the Sixth Amendment applies beyond, as the Government puts it, criminal jeopardy, this Court had answered that question in St. Cyr, where this Court said, in the text around footnotes 48 and 50, that any competent lawyer would give his client advice and a warning about deportation consequences of a plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.592" offset="2972365">So even if you needed more than Strickland itself, St. Cyr gave that to you in 2001, which is enough to decide this case; it was enough to decide Padilla.</text>

            <text syncTime="1518.964" offset="6181769">Let me answer both those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.666" offset="6184590">First, we are not asking this Court to create an exception to Teague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.185" offset="6198697">We are simply asking this Court to say Teague doesn't apply when a claim is, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.470" offset="6215833">"on the equivalent of direct review. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.922" offset="6221684">which is what this Court said in Martinez v. Ryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.022" offset="6230043">This Court has already held with respect to IAC that habeas rules, like the procedural default rule and like the Stone v. Powell bar against Fourth Amendment claims, do not apply in the IAC context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.080" offset="6274243">So this follows exactly from those previous holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.182" offset="6282706">Now, let me say two other things and then I can hopefully reserve my time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.634" offset="6296499">To answer your question about Martinez in State cases, it would depend on what the State system looked like, and I think States have their own decision to make as to whether they want a system like Arizona's, where these have to be brought in collateral proceedings, or whether, as I understand at least a couple of States do, say, we're going to stay and delay the entire direct review process, for years often, to allow the IAC claim to be brought then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.332" offset="6395242">Now, that's exactly what this Court rejected in Massaro, and the Government asked this Court to reject that in Massaro; said we don't want that kind of a system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.903" offset="6421573">I don't know why the Government is asking for it for the first time today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.390" offset="6435470">And finally remember, the last thing I would like to say is, all these problems raise not only finality concerns about the stay and remand procedures the Government suggests; they also raise insoluble conflicts of interest problems for Federal defender offices, who would have to bring IAC claims against themselves on direct review in order to preserve their ability to -- to get full relief for their client.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.143" offset="6662527">Justice Kennedy, what I would like to do, and I am happy to elaborate, if the formulation as I think you yourself put it in Wright v. West, which is that a rule that is, that is applied to a new set of facts does not create a new rule; but if you advance the law in some way you do create a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.903" offset="6725534">The last thing I would like to say about consequences is: Remember, the Government doesn't even have any answer for what is going to be half or more of the situations where people have Padilla-type claims, which is when they have a guilty plea and waive their right to direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.461" offset="6771823">So there the collateral filing like this is -- is absolutely the equivalent of direct review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.246" offset="7086964">--As for -- as for Padilla's rationale, the answer is yes, but there is a rationale that governed, in our view, misadvice claims that existed before Padilla.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.101" offset="7130328">It wasn't addressed or embraced in Padilla.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.270" offset="7139000">It was addressed in Justice Alito's concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.938" offset="7153733">Justice Alito gave two reasons which essentially mirrored the reasons that had been given in the lower courts for treating misadvice differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.944" offset="7185707">And that is, affirmative misadvice violated a more basic duty of counsel that was well established, which is not to represent that you're competent on a matter that you are not competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.519" offset="7231996">And the second distinction between misadvice and failure to give any advice is that a client has a constitutional right to make his or her own decision about whether to plead guilty; and a lawyer has a constitutional duty not to get in the way of that by affirmatively skewing the client's ability to make that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.682" offset="7316633">And so I would probably not disagree that misadvice claim was not new before Padilla and it's not really addressed by Padilla's rationale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.369" offset="7431467">And all of the courts that had adopted misadvice -- there were three of them that had done it in the removal context; there were three more that had done in the parole eligibility context -- they all simultaneously adhered to the view that as a general matter there is no obligation to give advice about collateral consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.396" offset="7507536">And they did this, I might add, despite the fact that, as Justice Kennedy alluded, the ABA, which was cited as one of the key sources of prevailing professional norms, stated in Standard 14.3.2, in the criminal justice pleas of guilty standards:</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.894" offset="7581514">"To the extent possible, defense counsel should determine and advise the defendant sufficiently in advance of any plea as to the possible collateral consequences that might ensue from entry of the contemplated plea. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.967" offset="7637834">So there was an aspirational professional norm that collateral consequences would be on the table, but all Federal courts that had looked at this question before Padilla had concluded that collateral consequences are outside of the duty of criminal defense counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.782" offset="11213057">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.699" offset="11216714">So given the fact that by and large it is, and I think should be, developed in that way, why not treat in the case of an inadequate assistance claim the first collateral as in other claims you treat direct review?</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.993" offset="11293932">Justice Breyer, let me give you a merits answer to that question, and then an answer on why I do not think Petitioner has fairly preserved or presented that issue to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.485" offset="11339908">The merits answer is that Teague reflects a fundamental judgment that when a case is final on its direct review, society has a strong interest in protecting that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.679" offset="11404692">And the exception to that is when the State or the Federal government has not conformed to existing constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.452" offset="11439800">Now, bringing that down to earth for ineffective assistance claims, at the time that Ms. Chaidez's conviction became final, and all convictions that became final before Padilla, jurisdictions had no reason to think that they needed to protect against the possibility that a criminal defense lawyer would not have advised about deportation, because the unanimous view was that's not something that's the Sixth Amendment duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.370" offset="11551395">Immediately after Padilla came down reflecting that it was, the Criminal Rules Committee began considering an amendment to Rule 11, which is now pending before the Judicial Conference, that would require judges to advise defendants about the possibility of deportation consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.866" offset="11629449">In other words--</text>

            <text syncTime="2890.622" offset="11668424">The point is that as soon as Padilla made it clear that a constitutional rule about defense counsel could threaten the finality of guilty pleas, the Rules Committee has taken steps to protect the integrity of federal judgments through a Rule 11 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.350" offset="11743343">It had no opportunity or reason to do that -- I can't say no opportunity, but it had no reason to do that as a constitutional matter until the Court decided Padilla.</text>

            <text syncTime="2974.043" offset="12002164">First of all, Massaro, which Mr. Fisher relies on, doesn't preclude a defendant from raising a claim on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.065" offset="12034243">It says that it's not a procedural default if he does not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.952" offset="12053782">A criminal defendant will probably not be in great shape to raise a -- a new rule claim on direct review, but he also will not be in great shape to raise it on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.141" offset="12090563">Unless this Court alters its Sixth Amendment holdings, such a defendant will be pro se, they will not have a lawyer, they will be pretty much in the same fix that they are in on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.763" offset="12136956">Now, if this Court announces that new rules under Strickland are not going to be applied to defendants whose convictions became final, then those defendants who want to raise a new rule claim are on notice that they'll need to do it on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.856" offset="12197351">Courts of appeals will be on notice that if someone raises such a claim, the appropriate thing to do is to adjudicate it or remand for its adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.044" offset="12238102">Now, right now the D.C. Circuit doesn't follow Massaro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.830" offset="12249283">It does remand ineffective assistance claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.198" offset="12258791">Mr. Fisher said he was unable to locate any cases where this actually happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.316" offset="12275196">You don't have to look any further than down the road to the arguments next week in Smith v.

            <text syncTime="3056.076" offset="12330262">It has a practice of doing that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3088.631" offset="12460457">I think Massaro makes that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.914" offset="12465577">But you have to understand how rare a new rule under Strickland really is, the way that the Court has administered Strickland to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.737" offset="12496923">Applications of the existing Strickland standard to particular sets of facts are not new rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.657" offset="12524613">That's why in the 28 years since Strickland none of this Court's decisions, and there are about 30 of them, under Strickland added up to a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.162" offset="12562648">Padilla broke ground because it answered the question, not how does Strickland apply, but whether it applies at all to something outside the compass of the sentencing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.720" offset="12604861">And so in that respect, there's no reason why the standard practice under Massaro should change if this Court were to address the issue and make clearer that new rules are not going to be applied on collateral review.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.458" offset="12735787">Is that an extra year to the statute of limitations for bringing a collateral claim or is it something more than that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3166.214" offset="12770791">It could be something more than that, because if the Court announces a new rule and makes it retroactive to a case on collateral review, (f)(3) of the statute of limitations provision gives the defendant another 1 year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.939" offset="12821678">And I think this case actually illustrates the mischief of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.443" offset="12839754">This case doesn't arise on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.909" offset="12845606">It arises on coram nobis 5 years after the conviction became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.663" offset="12864623">Now, if Petitioner were really serious that this Court should carve out from Teague ineffectiveness claims and adopt a rule just like the one that it did in Martinez v. Ryan, which is what he says on page 31 of his brief, then the Court should not give him the benefit of that rule, because Ms. Chaidez was on probation for 4 years after her conviction, she could have raised this claim after her conviction and sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.849" offset="12981338">She did not do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.801" offset="12997116">And I think this helps underscore why, if I can turn to this issue not being properly presented in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.872" offset="13025433">Petitioner did not raise the ineffective assistance of counsel type carve-out from Teague that Mr. Fisher raises in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.345" offset="13071304">That debuted for the first time in his merits brief after certiorari was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.683" offset="13096695">The Government acquiesced to get resolution of the new rule question that had divided the circuits and that will exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.789" offset="13129087">However this Court resolves this case, if it chooses to resolve it on the Massaro grounds, the new rule issue will still be salient for the States, it's still a circuit conflict that the Court needs to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.745" offset="13168897">It was not raised below, it wasn't raised in the certiorari petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.930" offset="13185720">The en banc petition raised a very general argument that Teague should not apply to federal convictions along the lines of what Justice Ginsburg asked me about, whether comity concerns and their absence meant there should be a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.122" offset="13242458">So you've got an argument that, so far as I can tell, has never been made to any Federal court before it's been made to this Court, and it would be remarkable for the Court to adopt that and then have to figure out, how does it apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.914" offset="13293554">Does Teague ever kick in?</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.234" offset="13314870">Lots of questions that no lower court has looked at, and that I would suggest this Court should not be the first to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.340" offset="13343291">It also raises an entirely new set of questions about whether Brady -- which also are kinds of claims that are typically raised on collateral review -- should now be exempt from Teague jurisprudence?</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.814" offset="13393237">I think the Court would really be engaging in kind of a sort of examination of Teague that had never happened before.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.488" offset="13647879">What he has done instead is concentrated much more on an analogy to Massaro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.726" offset="13668881">If I could give one more reason why I think the Court should refrain from entertaining that Massaro-based analogy here, the Court has just begun to embark in the Martinez v. Ryan line of cases on trying to figure out how ineffectiveness claims should be handled on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.837" offset="13737322">It grants its certiorari on Monday in Trevino v. Thaler, where it's going to explore how does Martinez apply in a jurisdiction that may be more like the Federal system in that ineffective assistance of counsel claims aren't channeled only to direct review, they can be asserted on direct -- I'm sorry -- only to collateral review, they can be asserted on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.453" offset="13827810">They are channeled largely to collateral review, but not as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.321" offset="13843274">So the Court has a lot of work to do in figuring out what that decision means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.658" offset="13864590">And I think rather than embark on a brand new process of applying that kind of reasoning in a case where it was never raised below, where the government never really had the opportunity to counter any of those arguments, and the lower court never had the opportunity to consider them, it's not a wise use of the Court's resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.870" offset="13937420">Instead, resolving the new rule question that has divided the circuits would provide an answer for us and the 28 states that filed an amicus brief that supported the United States on the new rule question, and would result, I think, appropriately, in concluding that Padilla was a new rule, unique among this Court's Strickland jurisprudence up to that time, and is not available to cases on collateral review.</text>

            <text syncTime="3492.359" offset="14075346">I'd like to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.276" offset="14079003">The first is, picking up where Mr. Dreeben left off, I'm not asking for any anything that is difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.478" offset="14095826">Mr. Dreeben referred to the Frady case, where this Court held that there is enough of an interest in finality to have procedural default apply to federal post-conviction review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.869" offset="14133443">Yet, in Massaro, this Court carved out IAC claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.988" offset="14145877">Exactly the same analysis applies here, and I do think the Court really ought to answer that question in this case because, if you hold that Padilla is a new rule and that Teague now applies to IAC claims, rest assured the Federal courthouses are going to be flooded, flooded with Federal -- with Federal defenders and other criminal lawyers raising IAC claims on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.334" offset="14235320">There'd be nothing else a responsible lawyer could do, because if you say Teague applies on -- if you wait until collateral review, but it doesn't apply on direct review, any responsible lawyer seeking to protect his client has to bring it on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.911" offset="14289550">It's going to absolutely change the way criminal procedure and criminal appellate procedure happens in the Federal court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.832" offset="14313270">The second point I wanted to make is back to the new rule question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.267" offset="14327062">I think I heard Mr. Dreeben say that the lower courts that had said that misadvice about deportation consequences violated Strickland had said something that was within Strickland that didn't constitute a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.075" offset="14378262">So it can't be that Strickland broke new ground, if he's correct, by saying deportation advice falls within the ambit of the Sixth Amendment in a guilty plea context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.680" offset="14416714">The only thing he relies on in the end is this distinction the lower courts had drawn between acts and omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.834" offset="14441270">And that's exactly the distinction in Strickland that this Court rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.536" offset="14456107">And in Padilla itself, this Court used the word absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.690" offset="14468750">And I think, Justice Kennedy, when you mentioned common sense, I think we could throw that in, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.308" offset="14487141">And so to the extent that the argument, at the end of the day when everything's stripped away, is that the lower courts were reasonable in saying that failing to advise about the most important thing a client would have been thinking as to whether to plead guilty is not ineffective assistance of counsel, whereas giving bad advice is, that's a line that Strickland itself rejected, that Flores-Ortega rejected when it came to the right to appeal and whether the lawyer ought to give advice; and, it's a line that this Court in Padilla had no difficulty whatsoever rejecting and called it absurd.</text>

            <text syncTime="3636.302" offset="14651190">Once we announce Padilla, any pending direct claim and any pending collateral claim that arises after Padilla for something that happened after Padilla would be covered by the rule, so there'd be no bar to those claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="3660.184" offset="14746693">The issue arises because Teague ordinarily comes into play when somebody asks the Court to create a new rule and apply it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.254" offset="14770935">So all the hypotheticals we've talked about today, about would Strickland apply here, would Strickland apply there, to parole advice, to professional license, all of those claims would be asking, if the government's correct, for a new rule.</text>
