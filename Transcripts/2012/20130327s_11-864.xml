            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Scalia has our opinion this morning in case 11-864, Comcast Corporation versus Behrend.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="7.970" stopTime="368.232">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="7.970" offset="138365">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.424" offset="164174">Comcast Corporation and its subsidiaries provide cable television services.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.128" offset="186953">From 1998 to 2007, they allegedly engaged in the series of transactions that the parties have described as “clustering.”</text>
            <text syncTime="30.295" offset="227600">A strategy of concentrating up their operations in a particular region that included 16 counties located in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.923" offset="274098">What they would do is buy out other companies in that area or trade-off a company in that area for one of their own elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.138" offset="319028">Respondents are subscribers to Comcast's cable services.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.937" offset="338150">They filed the class-action, alleging violations of federal antitrust laws, mainly that the clustering scheme harms the subscribers in the region by eliminating competition and holding prices for cable services above competitive levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.400" offset="415995">Respondent sought to certify a class of more than two million people pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (b)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="88.303" offset="459672">That rule permits certification only if “the Court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.”</text>
            <text syncTime="104.579" offset="524769">The District Court held and it is -- it was uncontested in this case that to meet the predominance requirement, respondents had to show, one, that the individual injury resulting from the alleged antitrust violation, referred to as a “antitrust impact,” was capable of proof at trial through evidence that was common to the class, rather than different for the individual members.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.750" offset="637409">And two, that the damages resulting from that injury were measurable on a classwide basis through the use a common methodology.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.205" offset="687250">Respondents proposed four theories of antitrust impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.783" offset="705536">One, Comcast's clustering resulted in decreased market penetration by direct broadcast satellite providers.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.759" offset="745451">Number two, Comcast reduced the level of competition from overbuilders that is companies that build cable networks in areas where an incumbent cable company already exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.504" offset="804488">Three, Comcast reduced the level of benchmark competition on which cable customers rely to compare prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.866" offset="841895">And four, Comcast's clustering increased its bargaining power relative to content providers.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.670" offset="873138">Each of these forms of impact, respondents alleged, increased cable subscription rates throughout the region.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.496" offset="904380">The District Court accepted only one of those four theories on antitrust impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.116" offset="926950">As capable of classwide proof, namely, the theory that Comcast activities reduced the level of competition from overbuilders.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.124" offset="966969">Proceeding then to the second question, the question of damages, the District Court found that damages could also be calculated on a classwide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.100" offset="1006885">And so concluding, however, the District Court relied on an expert model that did not isolate damages resulting form any one theory of antitrust impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.286" offset="1051606">That is to say it calculated the damages attributable to all four of the alleged antitrust impacts described earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.080" offset="1086715">The District Court certified the class and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.742" offset="1109389">The Court of Appeals saw no need for respondents to tie each theory of antitrust impact to a calculation of damages attributable to that impact because, the Court said, that would involve consideration of the merits of the antitrust claim which has no place, it said, in the class-certification inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.644" offset="1209072">We granted certiorari and today reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.595" offset="1224850">The class-action was improperly certified under Rule 23 (b)(3) by refusing to entertain arguments against respondent's damages model that bore on the propriety of class-certification simply because those arguments would also be pertinent to the merits determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.677" offset="1297157">The Court of Appeals ran a file of our clear precedence requiring precisely that inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.906" offset="1322026">And it is clear that under the proper standard for evaluating certification, respondents' model falls far short of establishing that damages are capable of measurement on a classwide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.260" offset="1375525">That is because as I have described, the model did not even attempt to calculate the damages resulting from reduced overbuilder competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.740" offset="1413454">The only theory of antitrust impact accepted for class-action treatment by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.130" offset="1438950">Respondents contend at the District Court's conclusion that the model was adequate, was a finding of fact that we must accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.542" offset="1476566">We think at no more a finding of fact than is a District Court's determination of what -- one of our our opinions holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.472" offset="1504360">And even if it were a finding of fact, it would be so obviously and exceptionally erroneous that we need not accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.170" offset="1535080">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.489" offset="1548351">Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer have filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan joined.</text>
