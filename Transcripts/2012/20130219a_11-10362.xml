            <text syncTime="13.308" offset="159203">The plain language of Section 2680(h) is law enforcement provides a waiver of sovereign immunity in clear, precise and unambiguous terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.478" offset="187834">It extends the waiver to any claim for one of the six enumerated torts committed by a Federal investigative or law enforcement officer acting within the scope of his or her employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.269" offset="227017">And it defines investigative or law enforcement officer as any officer of the United States who is quote, “ empowered by law ”, unquote, to carry out searches, seizures or arrests.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Paolella</label>
            <text syncTime="49.564" offset="304235">The proviso doesn't any employee of the United States who is authorized to carry out a search, seizure, or arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.635" offset="328477">It used the term</text>
            <text syncTime="56.587" offset="332343">"any officer of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="58.353" offset="339344">And I believe that the term “ officer ” carries some water here.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.705" offset="352823">If we look at a spectrum of individuals who have powers -- for example, to carry out searches -- we can envision on the one hand very traditional core of law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.179" offset="394723">Let's take a DEA officer who can carry out arrests, do searches and seizures, is authorized to use force.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.333" offset="419278">At the other end of the spectrum, we have something like a meat inspector or an OSHA inspector, who may have a limited ability to carry out searches, but these are searches that are in really a law enforcement capacity -- an administrative capacity as opposed to a core law enforcement capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.712" offset="484794">So the government raises the argument, and we think it's a plausible interpretation, that by using the term “ officer ” rather than any employee of the United States, that there was some limiting factor imported into the statute, thereby the statute's plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.852" offset="537352">And I would trust my colleague from the Solicitor General's office to map the boundaries of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.356" offset="559399">I would say that in any case, a correctional officer, who are the individuals who are involved here in committing the complained-of acts, certainly falls much closer to core law enforcement on that spectrum than to the administrative side.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="128.016" offset="618018">As a general matter, first in the States and then in the Federal Government, is a correctional officer or prison guard usually deemed to be a peace officer?</text>

            <text syncTime="138.972" offset="661904">In many States that use the term “ peace officer ” in the statutes defining a peace officer for things -- for example, authorizing the use of force or authorizing the carriage of weapons -- many States -- it's not uniform, but many States include correctional officers within that ambit.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.214" offset="718851">The Federal Government typically does not use the term “ peace officer ” in its statutes, but if you look at Federal statutes that use the term “ law enforcement officer ”, which is the very term that's used in subsection (h), many -- many of those other statutory schemes expressly include correctional officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.759" offset="784993">So, for example, for purposes of civil service pay, for purposes of death benefits, of retirement benefits.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="177.097" offset="814354">That doesn't prove that they're officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.032" offset="822087">I mean, that's -- that's not the test for an officer, how much you're paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.234" offset="834939">The test is whether you exercise significant authority under the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.888" offset="857509">That's a pretty fuzzy line, but I'm not sure that a prison guard exercises significant authority under the laws of the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Paolella</label>
            <text syncTime="199.112" offset="902439">I would think in the context of the prison, it's hard to imagine how a prison guard could exercise any more authority than they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.599" offset="928353">In addition to their correctional function, prison correctional officers are essentially the police force for the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.920" offset="953639">They are charged with maintaining order, and they're charged with enforcing the laws of the United States within the confines of the prison, and indeed in some specified cases, outside the prison walls.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.561" offset="996167">For example, they are explicitly authorized under Section 3050 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code not just to carry out arrests in prison for violations of Federal law, both by prisoners and visitors, but to carry out arrests outside the prison walls to prevent prisoner escapes or to prevent assaults on other law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.705" offset="1076833">So there's quite expressly an arrest authority granted to correctional officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.276" offset="1095118">In addition, they have the power to search for contraband, both in the context of visitors to prison and prisoners themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.676" offset="1200653">I don't want to let them establish the boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.945" offset="1209744">I want you to tell me, is it criminal law enforcement agents, is it law enforcement agents with -- acting -- as the Ninth Circuit says -- acting within a law enforcement activity?</text>
            <text syncTime="290.086" offset="1266273">Because I am finding it hard to figure out why we shouldn't permit tort liability on an OSHA inspector, who, in inspecting whatever he or she is inspecting punches someone or does some intentional assaultive act, why they should be permitted to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.385" offset="1351536">Assuming it falls within the definition of a law enforcement activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.737" offset="1372957">Justice Sotomayor, let me begin answering that question by making a distinction which I think is an important distinction here, between the definition of status and the definition of the conduct that's implied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.711" offset="1416842">Because I think this is a crucial difference between the amicus's argument on one hand and the Solicitor General's office on the other hand.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.305" offset="1471177">They would limit it to actions that occur in a law enforcement capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.542" offset="1492180">So I'm not sure exactly what that means.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.265" offset="2595069">It was never briefed before the Respondents' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.300" offset="2603115">And from my reading of the question presented as this Court formulated it, it was excluded from the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.954" offset="2625789">So I don't think this Court needs to address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.504" offset="2631954">It's more properly addressed on remand if it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.323" offset="2643239">But here I think that there is an argument that's within the scope of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.958" offset="2657763">And if you look at cases, for example the Mary M. case out of the California Supreme Court, there the California Supreme Court held that a sexual assault by a law enforcement officer of an individual who was subject to that officer's authority could be held to be within the scope of employment, because an officer is vested with authority and it is reasonably foreseeable that that authority can sometimes be abused if it happens when the officer is in uniform, on job hours, dealing with someone who that individual is authorized to use appropriate force against.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.013" offset="2785972">And even in Pennsylvania, you see cases where people do outrageous things, like a private detective shooting a picketing protester, where the Pennsylvania courts have held that that's within the scope of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.654" offset="2828604">It's a complicated issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.171" offset="2834665">It's an issue of State law and it will be different in every State, which is why I would suggest it's more appropriate for this to be handled on remand rather than have a ruling by this Court on a narrow issue of Pennsylvania State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.861" offset="2877401">But I think it is hardly implausible that Pennsylvania courts would find this within the scope of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="773.829" offset="3201319">As a result it will vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.197" offset="3210723">Some States have a rather broad understanding of scope of employment and sometimes in fact will encompass within the scope of employment rather egregious intentional torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.422" offset="3259625">It's not necessarily what the Court might think of as within the scope of one's Federal law enforcement authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.343" offset="3287314">So with respect to law enforcement authority, I mean, this -- that makes the question a little more difficult because that is not something that actually appears in the statute and it's not something that the United States embraces as a test because it is a creation of the amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.954" offset="3361816">What the statute here does, the only term -- the only place that it uses law enforcement is in the defined term “ investigative or law enforcement officer ” and then what it does in defining that term--</text>

            <text syncTime="851.710" offset="3512803">It could mean various things.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.579" offset="3520327">It could mean, for instance, something as limited as executing a search, seizing evidence or making an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.083" offset="3546345">That would be the Pooler type of rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.101" offset="3554390">It could be something incident to that, writing a report, as amicus suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.053" offset="3570168">It could be other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.255" offset="3574975">Law enforcement officers often aren't doing the very things that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.624" offset="3588454">They go on patrol, they talk to kids in schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.593" offset="3600366">There are all types of things that law enforcement officers might do that don't fall within what might thing -- what one might think of as what, you know, you see on television when officers are making contact with the public in rather high stakes incidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.185" offset="3666717">So it's difficult both because we have a State law term that varies and a term that doesn't even appear in the statute and that we don't embrace.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.093" offset="3906312">This came up in a case called Osborne v. Haley.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.778" offset="3921045">And the question about scope of employment for purposes of the Westfall Act turns on whether at the time of the alleged incident the officer, or employee in many cases, was acting within the scope of his or her employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.518" offset="3972036">Now, when the United States investigates, this is authority that is delegated to the Attorney General, which is in turn redelegated to the U.S. Attorney's offices, investigates the relevant circumstances and determines that the allegations are just false, not correct at all, in fact it never happened, the employee was sitting at his or her desk beavering away at important Federal matters, in that instance, the Government will say that the employee was in fact acting within the scope of his or her employment and can explain that the reason for that is the Government rejects the underlying factual assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.293" offset="4123128">That's something that then is litigated if the Plaintiff seeks to challenge the scope determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.297" offset="4151131">And the Court's decision in Osborne explains that this is how the situation will play out, is that then the merits of the case ultimately condense into a challenge to the scope certification of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.593" offset="4220304">So, no, we don't simply say they were within scope for no reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.813" offset="4241202">We determine whether they were within scope by evaluating the circumstances at issue and if the alleged circumstances did not occur and the employee was acting within the scope properly, we will certify that the employee was acting within the scope.</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.312" offset="5983256">In fact, what Congress did was reference back to the general waiver provision which explains that the waiver applies to acts within the scope of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1629.949" offset="6625763">First is about our reading of the law enforcement proviso as limited to conduct of investigative or law enforcement officers acting as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.388" offset="6655543">The first is that that reading is textually plausible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.077" offset="6690234">May I ask, in light of your opening statement, are you then abandoning your position that it must be either arrest, search or seizure?</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.801" offset="6737149">You have used the Ninth Circuit formula.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Bucholtz</label>
            <text syncTime="1661.253" offset="6750942">Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's not really clear how different the Ninth Circuit and the Third Circuit are from each other, because there haven't been cases that have arisen that have really tested the proposition that the Third Circuit meant only, literally only, the execution of a search, the seizure of evidence, or the making of an arrest, and that would exclude conduct very closely incident to one of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.017" offset="6837982">Those cases just haven't arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.469" offset="6843834">So the courts have used different formulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.404" offset="6851566">They appear to mean slightly different things by them, but I wouldn't want to exaggerate the differences between the Third Circuit and the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.641" offset="6876539">Both are trying to capture what Congress was getting at here, which was the law enforcement proviso was about law enforcement activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.128" offset="6906527">It was about covering the United States under the FTCA for abuses of law enforcement authority like had occurred in Collinsville, which was the national scandal that prompted the enactment of the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.019" offset="6946025">So I think the answer to, Justice Ginsburg, to your question, is: We think that if you take the Third Circuit's language in Pooler, which of course is not this case, but if you take the Pooler language literally and you say that the only conduct covered is conduct in the course of -- that's language the Court used a few times in Pooler -- in the course of a search, an arrest, or a seizure of evidence, that's problematic because it's clear that Congress was trying to cover abuses of law enforcement authority, including malicious prosecution and abuse of process, which we know because Congress included those torts in the exception to the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.907" offset="7077577">And if you had a situation where an officer conducted a search and then wrote a false report about the search that he had conducted, the writing of the report wouldn't literally be in the course of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.180" offset="7118642">So if you take those words in Pooler literally, that would be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.898" offset="7133584">That can't be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.981" offset="7137868">So to that extent we agree with the Ninth Circuit position rather than the Third Circuit position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.183" offset="7154691">But again I'm not really sure that it's fair to attribute that extreme position to the Third Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.543" offset="7212160">So I guess my question is, given that there is that conduct-based limitation in the statute, why one would substitute for it law enforcement officers acting as law enforcement officers?</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.623" offset="7296483">But really the reason is that under ordinary English usage, when there's a reference to somebody defined by their status, it's fair to assume that the reference to the person defined by their status is really just intended to cover things they do in that relevant status and not things they do in some other capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.386" offset="8087471">as acting as such, it's because -- in part the answer is because scope turns on State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.004" offset="8105966">So Congress doesn't know when it enacts the proviso what's going to be covered if the only limitation is scope, because that turns on 50 different States' laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.443" offset="8135745">And -- and I think that it's fair to say that there are actual meaningful differences between different States' laws as to scope as we -- as we point out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.263" offset="8166988">But the other past of the answer is the -- is the second part of this Court's analysis in Lane v. Pena, which is it's entirely possible literally to read the Rehabilitation Act in Lane, and I would grant that it's possible literally to read the words in the proviso, as covering everything that a defined law enforcement officer does within the scope of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.361" offset="8247445">But the Court said in Lane: We can't read the statute that way, because we're talking about a waiver of immunity, and waivers of immunity, even if you don't have to put a heavy thumb on the scales and even if you don't have to require that it be unequivocal -- we're not going that far here -- you can't interpret it more broadly than there's any reason to think Congress meant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2535.082" offset="10246335">But if the OSHA inspector knocks down your door and conducts an illegal search and batters you, why shouldn't that be covered?</text>

            <text syncTime="2566.386" offset="10371514">Because, Justice Kennedy, the point in this case is that we agree that correctional officers fall within the plain language of the definition that Congress provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.908" offset="10409548">Again, the structure of the proviso is there are two sentences, an operative provision and the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.377" offset="10427520">We are trying to get the Court to construe the operative provision, the first sentence, in the same way the Court did in Lane against Pena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.198" offset="10450717">The Government is trying to get the Court to construe the definition, the second sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.001" offset="10465972">What Congress said in the definition, what the term means, the Court has much less scope to construe that in some way other than the literal language that Congress provided where Congress said what the term means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.440" offset="10503693">So we agree under the plain language of the definition that correctional officers are investigative or law enforcement officers because of 18 U.S.C. 3050, which gives them the power under limited, and inapplicable here, circumstances to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.098" offset="10558341">We think that if you look at correctional officers under 18 U.S.C. 3050 or under the different authorities under 18 U.S.C. 4001 and following and the regulations, that they wear two hats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.823" offset="10601287">Sometimes they act in a law enforcement capacity, but not usually, because that only applies in the narrow context of escapes or visitors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2708.761" offset="10940983">And I don't see any basis consistent with the text or our understanding of what Congress intended, to the extent it's different from the text, to say that that's not covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2737.179" offset="11054668">Then it goes back to the question I asked one of your adversaries, which is all of this depends on how broadly or narrowly we define law enforcement activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.505" offset="11103987">If we take it as broadly as the Government is suggesting, at moments, it would -- we could very well say, you are right, it's a law enforcement activity, but not as narrowly as some would have it be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.165" offset="11162606">It would include securing or detaining people, or securing or detaining people.</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.719" offset="11292800">So the point is, why should we give it the narrow reading you are giving, and not the broader reading the Government seems to be suggesting?</text>

            <text syncTime="2804.806" offset="11325192">Well, two parts to the answer, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.825" offset="11337313">The first is the Government is trying to give the first sentence the broader reading, which it recognizes then creates a problem that it tries to solve by narrowing the second sentence in a way that we think won't hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.598" offset="11372317">But the other part of the answer, Justice Sotomayor, is it's about congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.102" offset="11390394">Justice Kennedy asked earlier about whether the Government's interpretation or the Petitioner's interpretation would unleash a flood of suits by prisoners and whether it's fair to think that Congress would have intended that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.108" offset="11426442">If you look at the legislative history of the proviso, there is absolutely no indication that anyone in Congress contemplated that the proviso would or could or should apply in the prison situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.796" offset="11469179">All Congress was focused on was providing a remedy for the kinds of raids that had occurred in Collinsville.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.717" offset="11488823">And so I think when somebody has two hats, like a prison guard has, because, again, there is two different sources of legal authority that they are exercising, 18 U.S.C. 3050 versus 4001, or a military policeman who has two hats, in the cases of Holian that we describe in our briefs where the Government made the argument that where a military policeman is engaged in a military function, not a law enforcement function, that they are not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.566" offset="11580251">We think where somebody who meets the definition that Congress provided of an investigative or law enforcement officer has two distinct hats, two distinct capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.219" offset="11610867">When they are not acting in the law enforcement one, they are not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.373" offset="11623510">There is no reason to think that Congress intended that military police or prison guards be covered when they are maintaining order on a military base or within a prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.229" offset="11658932">That's not what Congress was trying to get at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.846" offset="11665306">And we think again a severe disadvantage of the Government's position, they are trying to solve -- in a sense they are trying to solve the same problem that we are with our acting as such interpretation, but they are trying to solve it through the wrong part of the statute and in a way that -- in a way ends up with the worst of both worlds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.239" offset="11726955">You end up with broader coverage of the kind of conduct that's covered, broader than there is any reason to think Congress intended, conduct that doesn't involve law enforcement activity at all, but a narrower class of people whose conduct is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.748" offset="11777006">Where that excludes people like OSHA inspectors, FDA agents, EPA agents and in the rare circumstance where the Forest Service employee is acting as a law enforcement officer rather than as a botanist or an entomologist or something like that, we think Congress intended to cover them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.525" offset="11844088">We know from the definition that there were three exercises of law enforcement authority that Congress was focused like a laser beam on: Executing searches, seizing evidence and making arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.781" offset="11877107">Where somebody meets the definition of law enforcement officer and they are doing one of those three things, there is no basis not to say that they are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.601" offset="11904379">We think it's better to interpret the first sentence of the proviso the same way the Court did in Lane against Pena as limited to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers acting as such, and keep the definition that Congress provided the way Congress provided it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.721" offset="12736849">Well, I think -- one thing to point out is the government informs the Court in its reply brief that in a situation where there has been a violation of prison rules that may also be a violation of Federal law that may also be a crime, such that, you know, in ordinary English usage, you could refer to the prison guard as conducting an investigation for violation of a Federal crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.749" offset="12812918">What happens is the BOP guards don't do that themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.701" offset="12824725">They call in the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.768" offset="12829009">That's what the government says in its reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.553" offset="12836219">So I think that itself is an indication of the distinction between prison guards who are law enforcement officers as Congress has defined the term, but who are not traditional law enforcement officers, as the government seeks to define -- redefine the term, and in that capacity are not acting as law enforcement officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3213.292" offset="12959099">Well, Justice Kagan, it's hard to give a simple comprehensive answer that applies to all different types of law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.028" offset="12986057">Let me start by saying that the three things that have to be included are the three things that Congress specified, and that's one of the problems with the government's definition, is that it reads out cases involves those three activities, involving, in the government's view -- kinds of officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3237.137" offset="13054498">So -- in a case that involves one of those three things but also something else that's incident to or related to those three things, we think it would probably be artificial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.327" offset="13091278">And you can imagine all sorts of hypos, but it might well be artificial to separate the writing of the -- of the report about the arrest and the arrest itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.192" offset="13290749">And where I think it would be taking the Court is that as always, there could be hard cases that could arise that the lower courts would have to grapple with, but I think the important concept is, that where somebody has two hats, a law enforcement capacity and some other capacity, then it's easy to draw that line, in concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.352" offset="13355324">Again, there could be hard cases, but as a concept, it's easy to draw that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.073" offset="13370266">Where somebody doesn't have two hats, they only have one hat, like an FBI agent, and they are on the job and they are engaged in what normal people would think of as law enforcement activity, maybe that's covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.595" offset="13408300">I don't really have a -- have a problem with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.797" offset="13417182">I think -- I think that's probably consistent with what Congress was getting at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.083" offset="13438289">And maybe the way to think about it is, Congress defined “ law enforcement officer ” with reference to the three specified kinds of exercises of law enforcement authority, but when the FBI agent is interviewing a witness or potential suspect but hasn't yet gotten to the point of arresting a person or conducting a search, you can think of that as preliminary to an exercise of one of the three specified authorities, because after all, that's what the FBI agent has the authority to do, it's what his job entails.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.483" offset="13543928">And depending on how the initial questioning goes, that might be the next step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.970" offset="13561796">And so it's never far from the scene, when an FBI agent is engaged in what you would normally think of as law enforcement activity, that one of the three specified law enforcement activities could be in the offing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.326" offset="13603278">That's very different when you're talking about Forest Service employees who technically meet the definition but usually are not doing anything within a million miles of what normal people would think of as law enforcement activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.050" offset="13646119">So I think it's important to distinguish between different kinds of people who fall within the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.954" offset="13665763">And -- I understand the Court wants to try to figure out what the implications of this interpretation would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.108" offset="13694394">I think that in the prison context, the answer is clear, because there are two distinct capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.679" offset="13716650">And that's a hugely important context as a practical matter, given the point that Justice Kennedy made about the likelihood of an enormous number of claims that Congress probably didn't intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.201" offset="13750818">In the military police context, where there are also two distinct capacities, it's probably pretty easy to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.104" offset="13774433">In other cases, it will be case-by-case whether something that the Plaintiff alleges should be thought of as law enforcement activity or law enforcement officer acting as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.394" offset="13815497">We don't have a problem with the broad interpretation of law enforcement activity acting as such, dealing with the traditional law enforcement officer in a context that it's clear Congress intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.968" offset="14065855">It's -- it's not something -- that there are many, many cases, the vast majority of cases, involve individuals who will be by any reasonable definition core law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.275" offset="14111099">As far as I am aware, every Federal court to address the issue has defined correctional officers as law enforcement officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3533.128" offset="14238472">Justice Scalia, let me return to your earlier point about inferring congressional intent from, for example, from the list of enumerated torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.400" offset="14271595">And I think it's important to keep in mind that the best evidence of Congress's intent is the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.221" offset="14294896">And the fundamental problem with amicus's position is that he very ably uses tools for construing ambiguous statutes to construe a statute that at its core is not ambiguous, it's precise and it's definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.711" offset="14348813">Now, the coverage that is created by the literal words of the statute may be debatable as a policy matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.515" offset="14372010">Maybe it makes sense to include correctional officers, maybe it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.301" offset="14387161">But it's not absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.336" offset="14395311">And this Court's rule is when you were construing a non-ambiguous statute, Congress gets to draw that policy line, not the Court, as long as the result is not absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.477" offset="14439824">And we would argue that Congress drew that policy line here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.715" offset="14460826">It very specifically provided that any claim based on enumerated tort by a federal law enforcement officer acting within the scope of his or her employment, is where it drew that line, that's what the statute literally says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.974" offset="14521848">There is no argument about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.557" offset="14528222">And I think that all of the results, the parade of horribles that amicus has raised, again, may be debatable as a policy matter, but not one of them is an absurd exercise of Congress's responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.317" offset="14583184">And as a result, we would urge the Court to reverse.</text>
