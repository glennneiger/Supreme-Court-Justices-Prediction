            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="7.416" offset="136067">This case concerns the immigration consequences of a conviction for a marijuana distribution offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.717" offset="165324">Petitioner Adrian Moncrieffe is a Jamaican citizen who came to the United States legally at age three.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.073" offset="194685">Over 20 years later, during a traffic stop, police found about two or three cigarettes' worth of marijuana in his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.641" offset="228958">The State of Georgia charged him with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.817" offset="249752">He plead guilty under a Georgia program for first-time drug offenders which allowed him to avoid prison time.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.586" offset="284756">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, however, a non-citizen who is convicted of almost any drug offense may be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.228" offset="327387">And so the federal government sought to deport Moncrieffe because of his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.755" offset="349435">Ordinarily, a non-citizen may ask the Attorney General for discretionary relief for removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.266" offset="375557">But if a non-citizen has been convicted of a subset of drug offenses called “Illicit Drug Trafficking Offenses,” then the Attorney General is prohibited from granting discretionary relief no matter how compelling the non-citizen's case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.414" offset="448073">That is because illicit drug trafficking is considered an aggravated felony under the immigration laws, and aggravated felonies carry a specially harsh consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.676" offset="497183">An illicit drug trafficking offense is defined as any felony punishable under the Federal Drug Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.821" offset="525709">So the question before us is whether Moncrieffe's Georgia conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is equivalent to a felony under the felony drug laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.928" offset="578163">If it is equivalent, then Moncrieffe is subject to mandatory deportation as an aggravated felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.235" offset="607420">If it is not equivalent, then Moncrieffe is still deportable as a drug offender, but he may ask the Attorney General for discretionary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.539" offset="648589">Our cases have held that we determine whether a state offense is equivalent to a federal offense by using an analysis called “The Categorical Approach.”</text>
            <text syncTime="147.843" offset="697804">This is a somewhat complicated doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.892" offset="710029">The essence of it is that we do not examine the facts underlying the non-citizen's particular conviction to determine whether those facts could have given rise to a federal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.500" offset="764468">Instead, we consider whether any conviction of the state crime would necessarily establish the requirements of the possibly equivalent federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.290" offset="811593">If you think this is difficult, so does everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.844" offset="825804">If so, then we say that the state offense categorically matches the federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.863" offset="849941">This is an approached that has long been used in our immigration law.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.166" offset="867077">It promotes fairness by ensuring that all non-citizens who are convicted under the same statute are treated the same and it avoids the need to re-examine the underlying facts of old state convictions years later in immigration court.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.673" offset="937085">For Moncrieffe's Georgia conviction to count as an aggravated felony, it would need to categorically match a federal drug offense that is punishable as a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.893" offset="982016">There is no question that possession of marijuana would intent to distribute is a federal drug offense, but whether it is punishable as a felony under federal law depends upon the amount of marijuana and whether there was remuneration.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.383" offset="1055995">The mere social sharing of a small amount of marijuana is generally a misdemeanor under federal law, but if the offense involves a sale or a larger amount of marijuana, it is a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.352" offset="1111897">Here, the Georgia statute says nothing about remuneration -- boy, that word gets me -- or the quantity of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.353" offset="1147841">It punishes all instances of possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.466" offset="1168321">Including those had involved just a small share -- social sharing of a small amount of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.404" offset="1196011">The Georgia statute is thus broader than the federal aggravated felony because it comprises both marijuana distribution offenses that are punishable as felonies and those that are punishable as misdemeanors.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.575" offset="1252749">As a result, a conviction under the Georgia statute does not categorically fit within the federal definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.828" offset="1281797">And so, Moncrieffe's conviction is not an aggravated felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.325" offset="1299769">The government has argued that the misdemeanor provision for sharing a small amount of marijuana should not be relevant under the categorical approach because in a federal drug prosecution, it would be a mere sentencing exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.362" offset="1359851">Instead, the government suggests that convictions like Moncrieffe's should be presumed to be an aggravated felony, but that non-citizen should then be allowed to show in immigration court that their convictions involved only a small amount of marijuana pursuit for no money.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.532" offset="1432576">For reasons set forth fully in our opinion, we reject that position because it is unsupported by the text of the immigration law and inconsistent with our established categorical approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.434" offset="1492135">Again, our inquiry must focus on what a non-citizen's conviction standing alone established, not what acts he committed on a particular occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.052" offset="1534663">And Moncrieffe's conviction does not establish an offense that necessarily qualifies for felony treatment under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.897" offset="1569980">The government also fears that this approach will allow those who actually committed to serious drug trafficking offenses to avoid being labeled as aggravated felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.639" offset="1617000">But remember that escaping aggravated felony treatment only means escaping mandatory deportation, not deportation altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.979" offset="1658378">A serious drug trafficker whose state conviction is not categorically an aggravated felony may apply to the Attorney General for relief, but the Attorney General may deny that relief in his discretion because of its non-citizen's serious -- more serious conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.390" offset="1736014">So the effect of this decision on a government's ability to police our boarders is limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.394" offset="1764018">The judgment of the Sixth -- Fifth Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.904" offset="1782094">Justices Thomas and Alito have each filed dissenting opinions.</text>
