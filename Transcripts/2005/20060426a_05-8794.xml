            <text syncTime="8.986" offset="185328">In Nelson v. Campbell, this Court held that a challenge to procedures to execute an inmate may be brought in a section 1983 action unless the challenge would necessarily prevent the State from carrying out its execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.036" offset="237469">Mr. Hill does not challenge the State's right to execute him by lethal injection, but instead, only challenges the particular protocol the Florida Department of Corrections in their discretion has adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.398" offset="286893">Mr. Hill's claim, thus, does not necessarily prevent his execution, and his claim falls squarely within the scope of Nelson, as announced by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.118" offset="325763">The current claim... the only focus of that claim is the discretionary choice of the particular injection procedure that has been chosen by the Florida Department of Corrections.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.653" offset="371947">Therefore, it does not violate Nelson because the relief sought would not necessarily prevent the State of Florida from carrying out its execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.467" offset="411235">The State could still carry out the execution through a more humane means by offering the particular protocol that... that they have adopted.</text>
