            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="153116">We'll hear argument first today in Washington v. Recuenco.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.702" offset="167849">Mr. Whisman.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_m_whisman" startTime="5.904" stopTime="107.851">
            <label>Mr. James M. Whisman</label>
            <text syncTime="5.904" offset="176731">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="202331">When a judge, rather than a jury, decides a fact that increases the defendant's punishment above the applicable standard range, the Sixth Amendment's jury trial right is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.496" offset="239007">This is true regardless of whether the fact is called an element or whether it is called a sentencing factor because elements and sentencing factors are functionally equivalent under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.589" offset="295431">It follows that the same harmless error rule that applies to missing or misdescribed elements should also apply to missing or misdescribed sentencing enhancements.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.879" offset="332629">In a series of Washington decisions, the Washington Supreme Court has held that harmless error analysis may never be conducted as to a missing or misdescribed sentencing enhancement simply because it is called a sentencing enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.122" offset="389576">This rule of absolute prohibition is inconsistent with this Court's jurisprudence and should be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.108" offset="413505">Before I go on, however, to explain the legal basis and the flaws in the legal reasoning of the Washington State Supreme Court, I would like to take a brief moment to address a few State law issues that have been raised by the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.166" offset="465749">The first is the question of whether or not at all in Washington we can, at present, seek deadly weapon enhancements or, more specifically, firearm enhancements.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.605" offset="503470">It was alleged in the respondent's brief that we cannot, and I'd just point out to the Court that there is no authority in Washington for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.961" offset="536907">And so asking this Court to simply affirm the... the firearm enhancement that was originally imposed in this case does not constitute imposing a sentence that would any way be inconsistent with Washington law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="107.851" stopTime="144.707">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="107.851" offset="584450">On... on that point, I have... I have one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.887" offset="596571">At page 3a of the petition appendix, the Washington Supreme Court's opinion is set forth, and in the course of that opinion, it says, to the contrary, when defense counsel argued the definition should have been submitted to the jury, the prosecutor explicitly stated that the method under which the State is alleging and the jury found assault was committed was by the use of a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.633" offset="683611">And then he goes on to say, in the crime charged in the enhancement, the State alleged there is no element of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.637" offset="707643">The element is assault with a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.589" offset="719451">I don't... this was at the sentencing proceeding, I take it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_m_whisman" startTime="144.707" stopTime="145.541">
            <label>Mr. James M. Whisman</label>
            <text syncTime="144.707" offset="731885">I believe that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="145.541" stopTime="148.243">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="145.541" offset="735229">Yes, because I couldn't find it in the sentencing proceeding.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_m_whisman" startTime="148.243" stopTime="218.386">
            <label>Mr. James M. Whisman</label>
            <text syncTime="148.243" offset="745991">In the... in a subsequent or nearly subsequent breath, the prosecutor then asked for the enhancement, the 36-month enhancement, that applies for firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.265" offset="782145">I think what you're seeing there is that the prosecutor was responding to the... to defense counsel's use of the term element.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.002" offset="809103">And in... in the year 2000, before Apprendi, before Blakely, we never would have used that term as applied to a sentencing enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.108" offset="845465">We just didn't think of it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.841" offset="848391">Now, we have since changed our thinking, obviously, after Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.060" offset="861348">But I think if you... on the... on the overall point, if you look at defense counsel's comments beginning with the comments pretrial, where he notes that I can see no relevance to... to the admission of a different gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.902" offset="916623">Then he comments, Ms. Recuenco was threatened with a 380 automatic with a clip.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.771" offset="932192">Regarding the charge in particular, counsel at JA, page 30 says, the allegation and the basis on which this case was tried was under a theory of firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.179" offset="977749">At JA 37, counsel said, the firearm is an element of this offense as it has been pleaded and argued to the jury and evidently, perhaps, obviously proven to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.803" offset="1024247">So--</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="218.386" stopTime="224.456">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="218.386" offset="1026651">It does sound as if he thinks there was... the prosecutor thought there was no error.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.921" offset="1040757">A deadly weapon is a deadly weapon, and then--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_m_whisman" startTime="224.456" stopTime="252.190">
            <label>Mr. James M. Whisman</label>
            <text syncTime="224.456" offset="1050892">--That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.140" offset="1053609">And... and I think, Your Honor, that stems from the... from the way the statutes are structured.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.242" offset="1066043">Beginning many, many years ago, in Washington we had what we called a deadly weapon enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.896" offset="1088613">So there was no distinction made between any kind of weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.264" offset="1102092">In 1995, the law changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.299" offset="1114213">There was a distinction made as to firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.168" offset="1125707">The... the penalty was increased as to firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.401" offset="1130618">And so beginning that time, there was a material distinction depending on the weapon that was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.155" offset="1153710">But I think that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="252.190" stopTime="258.260">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="252.190" offset="1161860">Was deadly weapon still an enhancement at that point, or was deadly weapon part of the definition of a new crime?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_m_whisman" startTime="258.260" stopTime="310.110">
            <label>Mr. James M. Whisman</label>
            <text syncTime="258.260" offset="1186102">--Deadly weapon was still called an enhancement, Your Honor, under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.712" offset="1199895">And so the statute defined deadly weapon very generally, and then in the punishment section, the punishment provisions, which specifically were formerly under section 310 of the Sentencing Reform Act... now it's been renumbered to be 533.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.174" offset="1269798">Under that provision... you have two provisions, one which provides the punishment for deadly... for firearms, and under this... for this case, that would be 3 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.780" offset="1308146">And then as to the rest, it says if someone was armed with a deadly weapon other than a firearm, you have a lesser penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.219" offset="1345972">So as I say, I think that for a long time we have treated... in Washington, we've treated all of these things as deadly weapons, but recognized that if it was a firearm, the penalty was greater than if it were something other than a firearm.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>

            <text syncTime="316.431" offset="1418801">You... you seem to be describing now deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.132" offset="1433638">That's one thing, and that excludes guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.869" offset="1452551">And then firearm, a discrete category.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.321" offset="1466344">But I thought that deadly weapon includes at least pistols and revolvers.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.010" offset="1501139">A firearm includes pistols and revolvers because a firearm is something... anything from which a projectile is fired.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.320" offset="1566340">That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.653" offset="1571669">It was... it was... the... the jury instructions went to the jury to find deadly weapon as a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.574" offset="1595389">And over and over, the court reiterated, especially in the instructions conference, that the... there's no question but that the only weapon here is a firearm, and so they used the simplified version of the instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.666" offset="4351725">In Cotton, this Court held that that same type of error does not impugn the integrity, public reputation, or fairness of judicial proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.316" offset="4698318">And in fact, what would happen in cases like this and a lot in the Federal system, where you have undisputed, uncontested facts... and we know that because they had the incentive to contest them at a sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.039" offset="4745234">And so to hold that automatic reversal is required would mean it would go back for a retrial that would have nothing to do... nothing to do with the element that was not decided by the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1447.288" offset="5942164">But the... the law required that you find a deadly weapon but it wasn't which deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.073" offset="5957315">It was just a baseline eligibility, and then it was up to the court to decide which deadly weapon which would then dictate the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.096" offset="5989498">And one other point I'd like to make clear is there's been some argument that this case is different from Neder because you have a completed defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.666" offset="6015725">That is no different at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.849" offset="6020427">You had a completed verdict for a non offense in Neder, and the distinction between a judge making findings that make a verdict that support a non offense into offense is not one that makes a structural difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.426" offset="6074762">And in Carella v. California, Rose v. Clark, you had elements that stood on the fault line between lesser included offenses and greater included offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.781" offset="6112169">Now, they weren't missing... they weren't technically missing elements, but they were elements that were subject to mandatory presumptions by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.435" offset="6138814">And yet, this Court said that they're subject to harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.553" offset="6151248">Now, obviously, the type of the element is going to affect the government's ability to prevail under harmless error analysis, and there may well be times when the government will not succeed in that process, especially as you get elements that are more central to, you know, the... the crime and... and traditional elements like the intent issues that were at issue in both Carella and in Rose v. Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.388" offset="6254589">The other point I wanted... I wanted to make is that the fact that the jury verdict form here came back consistent with... with the... or the jury verdict form in Neder came back with the completed crime shouldn't make a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.481" offset="6314984">The change in the... that jury verdict only came back because of a second mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.950" offset="6328881">The jury was wrongly and mistakenly told that if it found elements A, B, and C, it would... it would establish a... a completed crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.205" offset="6361900">The fact that in this case you don't have that second error isn't again a difference that makes one error structural and the other nonstructural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.394" offset="6398680">The important thing is that the right is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.513" offset="6411114">The cost... the right to the same, the ability of courts to analyze this error is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.267" offset="6434102">And on the other hand, a rule of automatic reversal will impose an enormous cost on victims and the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.181" offset="12809756">--But... but, again, in Neder, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the offense that was litigated to it and based on the parties' understanding of what offense was at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.121" offset="12845596">In this case, that doesn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.506" offset="12855105">And, again, it's illustrated by the prosecutor's response to Mr. Recuenco's motion to vacate, and it's illustrated by the court's judgment and sentence, which is at page 14 of the joint appendix, where it specifically finds that the only verdict... and... and again, doesn't question the verdict... that the only verdict returned was deadly weapon other than a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.986" offset="12937025">It doesn't assume that the jury found that it was the firearm verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.521" offset="12951131">It doesn't make that assumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="3202.723" offset="12963983">Based on then existing Washington law, which Recuenco overturned, it concluded it had to impose the firearm enhancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.412" offset="12998674">So there's no suggestion by either of the parties or the trial court or the Washington Supreme Court, for that matter, that there was anything wrong with the jury returning a verdict of deadly weapon because, as a matter of Washington law and as recognized by each of those... those entities, the jury... the jury could do that, and they did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.738" offset="13575980">Mr. Whisman, can I... can I ask you a hypothetical which I think puts in starker form what the... what your colleague here says this case involves?</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.712" offset="13623940">Suppose that... that you have a statute, a murder statute, which applies the murder of a single individual, but... but you have another statute with a death penalty called aggravated murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.222" offset="13681932">And it's a different crime and it... it requires the... the killing of more than one person in... in the same... in the same event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.994" offset="13721012">Let's assume a trial in which somebody came into a bank with a machine gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.565" offset="13743372">Only one person came in, and five people were killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.867" offset="13756538">But the prosecution only brought a prosecution for simple murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.337" offset="13778376">Okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.571" offset="13779317">And the jury comes back with a verdict for... for simple murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.658" offset="13803663">Certainly a judge would not be able to say, well, no jury could possibly have found simple murder here without also thinking that this person was guilty of... of this greater offense of... of aggravated murder and, therefore, I'm going to enter a judgment of aggravated murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.404" offset="13886732">That's what the... the defense says happened here, that there was just a verdict of... of the lesser offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.527" offset="13919124">That's all the jury found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.212" offset="13929887">It could have found more and maybe... maybe in finding that, it... it must have thought that the greater offense also existed, but it never came in with a verdict for the greater offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.752" offset="13968025">Now, tell me why what happened here is different from... from the hypothetical.</text>

            <text syncTime="3459.056" offset="13989237">I think the key difference is the charging part of your hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.341" offset="14002403">Your hypothetical assumes this defendant was never put on notice that he was facing aggravated murder, and if that were true, then under your cases and under... under our Washington law, we would analyze that as a failure of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.315" offset="14050363">The... and it could have any number of implications for a defendant, including the evidence that they marshal at trial, but also including perhaps his interest in negotiating a plea agreement if a defendant doesn't know that he's facing aggravated murder at the end.</text>

            <text syncTime="3520.796" offset="14236251">Although under Washington law, we analyze the charging document and the sufficiency of it and ask whether or not it was... the words used sufficiently apprised the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.568" offset="14271359">But I think the defendant would have a stronger argument for the fact that he didn't know what he was facing if you had that hypothetical.</text>

            <text syncTime="3544.495" offset="14331023">They can be a component of the harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.196" offset="14341890">Ordinarily in Washington, we would handle that as a charging document challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.898" offset="14356623">In other words, the defendant would say I was never charged with this crime and therefore I didn't marshal my evidence, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.469" offset="14378984">It's a due process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.119" offset="14381492">Either way, I don't think that the... the conviction stands much chance of surviving.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.123" offset="14405524">I did want to answer, first, a question that had been raised by pointing the Court to JA 18 where the defendant says, my proposed instruction makes clear that the deadly weapon in question is the firearm, that... not that some other kind of weapon might have been deadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.168" offset="14473756">So I think that focuses the issue appropriately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.453" offset="14486922">I also wanted to point out that Justice Alito's hypothetical is really the State v. Williams case that we cited at page 14 in our reply brief where the defendant was expressly charged firearm and the victim was shot during the course of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.462" offset="14546899">And the issue didn't go... the... the same verdict form as we have here... in other words, it said only deadly weapon... was given to the jury, and the Washington court of appeals, feeling itself bound by Recuenco, reversed that finding. So I think that the opinion of the Washington Supreme Court is unduly broad and should be overturned.</text>
