            <text syncTime="39.923" offset="314300">In particular, this case concerns the reimbursement of health benefits by a Federal employee to his Federal Government health benefit plan, which is known as the service benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.644" offset="353171">That plan is governed Federal Employees Health Benefits Act, FEHBA, and is established through a Federal Government contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.180" offset="991290">And the result of them is that they save the Government money.</text>

            <text syncTime="270.237" offset="1235587">In those cases, for instance, they... the principle is simple and it's a strong one, and that is that Congress assumes that a... when it calls for the creation of a... a contract in a statute, that it will be enforceable just as with ordinary contracts.</text>
