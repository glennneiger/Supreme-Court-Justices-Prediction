            <text syncTime="8.625" offset="192586">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="12.116" offset="206483">In its opinion in Jefferson Parish, the Court stated that the key characteristic of illegal tying is the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the purchase of the tied product.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.687" offset="260817">The Court held that the per se rule against tying applies only if the plaintiff proves that the seller has... and I'm quoting from that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.741" offset="293000">The quote is on page 12 of our brief... the special ability, usually called market power, to force the purchaser to do something that he would not do in a competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.530" offset="332184">If the Court were confronted today for the first time with the question whether the presence of a patent on some aspect of the tying product by itself demonstrates the existence of this forcing power, it's inconceivable that the Court would adopt that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.820" offset="385369">Not only is there no empirical evidence to support it, there's no logical basis for such a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.227" offset="406999">The focus of patent rights is very different from antitrust market analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.873" offset="429568">Patent rights are tied to a particular invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.254" offset="443048">Market power is buyer centric.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.051" offset="454228">A buyer may be able to choose from a number of different products, some patented, some not, to satisfy his or her need.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.093" offset="482440">The existence of a patent on one of those devices does not preclude at all the existence of alternatives that are equally attractive, maybe even more attractive, to the customer.</text>

            <text syncTime="96.028" offset="542208">Are there component parts that are patented in today's complicated world, and do they... do they... do the component parts become part of the tying product?</text>

            <text syncTime="110.611" offset="600514">One of the... one of the evils of the presumption is that there's nothing that says that the patent has to be on the entire product.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.782" offset="629144">The... the patent could be on a component of a product.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.180" offset="638757">And in today's world, as Your Honor says, television sets, CD devices, cell phones, all of those devices are loaded with components, one of which may happen to be patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.822" offset="681389">It may not be the one that makes the... it may not have to do with anything that makes that product attractive in the marketplace, but the presence of that patent would be relied upon to make the presumption applicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.039" offset="782222">But I think there also is an argument that even if some component is... is patented, that component, because it's in that product, gives that product market power because the theory would go the patent would exclude the ability of other competitors in the market to use that component.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.571" offset="972288">The argument would be, if I'm a competitor, I can't duplicate that product because that component is patented, and therefore, that product that contains the patented component should get the benefit of this market power presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.683" offset="4452739">The presumption that patents confer market power is counter factual, inconsistent with this Court's modern antitrust jurisprudence, out of step with congressional action in the patent area, contrary to the views of leading antitrust commentators and the Federal antitrust enforcement agencies, and unnecessarily harmful to intellectual property rights and procompetitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.206" offset="4550855">For all those reasons, the presumption should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.487" offset="4564021">There's no plausible economic basis for inferring market power from the mere fact that a defendant has a patent on a tying product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.701" offset="4596831">As this Court has recognized, many commercially viable products are the subject of patents that do not confer market power because there are reasonable substitutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.655" offset="4628700">Nor does the combination of a tie in a patent provide a valid basis for presuming market power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1169.661" offset="4836739">Indeed, as we explain in our brief, Congress in our view has already done that because, again, Loew's expressly states that the rationale for the presumption it adopts is that in the patent misuse cases, the Court has... at that time, had rejected any attempt to extend the monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.894" offset="4905598">But Congress, in 1988 in the Patent Misuse Reform Act, overruled those cases and held that there cannot be patent misuse in the absence of an actual showing, based on all the circumstances, of market power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.408" offset="5775684">But the... the fact of a requirements tie, standing alone together with a patent, is not meaningfully probative of market power because his thesis is that the requirements tie is always used for metering, and metering is evidence of price discrimination, and price discrimination is evidence of market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.571" offset="5848305">But again, there's a great deal of disagreement and, indeed, the majority view is that price discrimination is not necessarily or even usually evidence of market power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1529.192" offset="6274832">We have not taken a position on that question in this case because, in our view, it's not necessary to reach that in order to reverse the judgment below which... which rests entirely on the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.411" offset="6315688">The Loew's presumption is also, in our view, undermined by this Court's modern antitrust cases, such as Jefferson Parish and Eastman Kodak, because the presumption... the fact that the Loew's presumption recognizes is not market power in the modern sense of the term, as it is understood and required under Eastman Kodak and Jefferson Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.420" offset="6407743">Rather, what the Loew's Court said is that uniqueness suffices to establish the requisite economic power regardless of the ability to control price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.486" offset="6440031">The Court specifically said on page 45 of the decision that... that ability to control price need not be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.403" offset="6463645">That's a different fact that... that is being presumed in Loew's than the fact that is now required as part of the Court's modern per se tying jurisprudence, which is actual, significant market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.075" offset="6506382">So even if the Loew's presumption had any continuing force, which we don't think it does, it doesn't presume the relevant fact under this Court's modern cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.571" offset="6540341">So for that reason as well, the judgment of the court of appeals is incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3200.638" offset="12960612">But it is harder for us to find out what new competitors have come into the tying product market in the meantime, and it is easier for defendants to prove the affirmative, that there is a reasonable substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.762" offset="13005124">Of course, in their own promotions and advertising, they said that nothing else is as good as their printer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.054" offset="13022261">But it's reasonable to ask them to prove that there is a reasonable substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.473" offset="13035949">It's far harder to ask the plaintiff to prove that there's no reasonable substitute because we don't have access to the information about their competitors that they could be expected to keep as a matter of ordinary business records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.704" offset="13076909">But, Justice Ginsburg, to return to your point, if there's any doubt about whether metering can ever be efficient, if there's any doubt about whether there could be a procompetitive reason for a requirements tie, evidence that has utterly been failed to be presented here, where there's no economist brief on their side and several economist briefs on our side by very distinguished economists cited by the other side, if there is any doubt about that kind of economic wisdom, then indeed it should be decided by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.941" offset="13177846">It's a matter of economic policy to be decided by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.749" offset="13189026">Congress has not only failed to reform the antitrust laws in 1988, when it looked at a bill that the Senate had written and the House rejected it, it's failed five times since then to reject this presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.496" offset="13236047">So there's nothing murky about the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.970" offset="13241898">It's still the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.063" offset="13246287">If petitioners really petitioners really believe they can come forward with an economic record they haven't come forward with so far, Congress is open and able to correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.368" offset="13279515">But when this Court has guided plaintiffs and defendants for 60 years with a presumption that still makes good economic sense... and Justice Stevens, if there were anything to the metering argument, why wouldn't Trident simply put a counting chip in the printhead and say we're going to charge you a per use fee?</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.861" offset="13577520">This is not a case where, as the concurring opinion in Jefferson Parish suggested, there might be very sensible ways to see efficiencies in a bundle where I buy two products at the same time, an air... a car that comes with tires and an air conditioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.255" offset="13635093">But it's quite a different matter because the cost savings from that accrue to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.010" offset="13654111">There are efficiencies that can be passed on to the consumer by bundling two products that can be simultaneously purchased and consumed together.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.491" offset="13736031">And in the absence of that kind of evidence, there's no reason to overrule a sensible rule that does not just date to Loew's, as Mr. Hungar incorrectly suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.806" offset="13769258">It dates back to Salt, to 1947 for arguments in our... we've argued in our brief that Salt had to depend on the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.429" offset="13799769">And the Court was... with respect to the petitioners' argument that the Court didn't know what it was doing when it decided those cases, we respectfully disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.984" offset="13833937">The Court was well aware, as it indicated 2 years later in Standard Stations that there might be some substitutes for a patented product, and it reaffirmed the... the presumption anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="3480.650" offset="14080638">The presumption has been in effect for 60 years, but there could be grave danger to this Court lifting it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.999" offset="14174052">With respect to respondent's last argument about affirming on the basis of direct evidence, that's an argument that the district court found to have been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.635" offset="14208638">On page 30a of the joint... of the appendix to the petition, the court noted that the plaintiff prefers no direct evidence of market power, such as supracompetitive prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.836" offset="14249389">And in fact, the price evidence that they rely on here was not even cited or attached to the summary judgment motions on the market power issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.460" offset="14279900">Respondent's argument is a little peculiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.608" offset="14292439">It... it basically is because we can't establish a procompetitive justification for this particular tie, the presumption should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.322" offset="14323368">Of course, the issue in the district court wasn't whether or not this tie was procompetitive, so we didn't introduce evidence about whether or not the tie was procompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.286" offset="14355237">We introduced evidence about market power because the issue was market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.444" offset="14367880">I think respondent is putting the cart before the horse here in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.949" offset="14385853">And there is no consensus of economists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.999" offset="14398078">And we discuss this on pages 11 to 13 of our reply brief, that respondent's syllogism of metering equals requirements tie equals proof of market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.911" offset="14441650">Each of those three things are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.766" offset="14449069">There are procompetitive justifications for metering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.796" offset="14461190">Metering and price discrimination is not evidence of... of market power of the type that the Court required in Jefferson Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.477" offset="14491910">It's evidence of some modicum of market power, but not enough market power to meet the tying requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.224" offset="14514897">And... and I... that's very clear from the economic literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.065" offset="14526287">And there are other justifications that are advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.417" offset="14543737">In this case preservation of quality was advanced as a justification.</text>
