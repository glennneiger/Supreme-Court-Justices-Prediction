            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="5.877" offset="167602">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="14.762" offset="203233">This is a routine diversity case that went seriously awry in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.460" offset="226012">The original defendants in... named in the complaint, Petitioners State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which I'll refer to as SWIB, and Lincoln Property Company, are completely proper and diverse parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.422" offset="281809">SWIB owned the apartment complex, and Lincoln managed it through agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.937" offset="303856">The fourth circuit, nonetheless, embarked on a search for affiliates of Lincoln that it thought would be more appropriate party defendants, what the court deemed, quote, "real parties in interest".</text>
            <text syncTime="53.319" offset="357460">The fourth circuit's holdings are fundamentally flawed, in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.481" offset="374074">First, because the named defendants are proper parties, the court erred in holding that Lincoln had not carried its burden of proof by failing to establish that some non named putative defendants might possibly destroy complete diversity, and that the remedy for such a possibility was dismissal of the action from Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.806" offset="463412">Second, the court erroneously engrafted a, quote, "very close nexus" requirement onto the test for require... for determining the citizenship of a limited partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.624" offset="514612">Now, with respect to the first issue, a number of black letter legal principles govern a court's consideration of non named parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.323" offset="553483">Let's start with the statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.251" offset="565185">The diversity statute, at section 1332(a), talks about civil actions, and a "civil action" is defined as the naming of a plaintiff and a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.608" offset="614609">A civil action does not encompass those that are not named in the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.541" offset="634358">That language is tracked in the removal statute, section 1441(a), which also speaks of civil actions, and in... mirrored in 1441(b), which says that a defendant may remove, where it is properly joined and served.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="139.030" offset="700291">Well, I thought (b) simply enacted a special necessary condition when you had a local defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.549" offset="738325">I thought it was not an eligibility provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.099" offset="752536">I thought it was a limitation provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.436" offset="761940">It is, Justice Souter, but what... my argument is that that language, properly joined and served, simply tracks the civil action requirement under the original diversity statute, as well as the removal provision of 1441(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="169.921" offset="823798">But what the court--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="170.714" stopTime="187.013">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="170.714" offset="827037">Well, it's consistent with it, but I... it seems to me that it's a bit of a stretch to say that anyone who is properly joined and served, at least in a formal sense, is, therefore, the only person who may be considered in a... in a diversity inquiry.</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="187.013" offset="892238">--What the court of appeals did, and where we think it got off track, was it took the... to... the phrase "parties in interest", and it... and it took cases from this Court that have used the phrase "real parties in interest" to determine what are proper party plaintiffs, and it used that concept on the defendant's side of the ledger.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.048" offset="968307">And none of the cases from this Court talk about "real parties in interest" as being defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.255" offset="993176">The explanation given by the court for doing it on the plaintiff's side is to ensure that a defendant is not going to be subjected to multiple suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.863" offset="1031628">But there are many purposes--</text>

            <text syncTime="223.198" offset="1036957">So, I take it your answer to Justice Souter is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.161" offset="1056810">In other words, if the mistake that the court made was relying on 1441(b), it was a similar mistake for you, in your opening brief, to put such weight on that language in 1441(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="238.963" offset="1099964">--Our position, Your Honor, is that the phrase "parties in interest"... we were seeking to find out where the court could have applied that phraseology on the defendant's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.874" offset="1143641">And the only place that we could find, in the statutes or the rules, was in 1441(b) and the explanation for removal, that we were not a "proper party in interest".</text>
            <text syncTime="261.990" offset="1192124">And that's why we focused--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="263.362" offset="1197558">Mr. Frederick, what about cases where a plaintiff sues two defendants... one is diverse, and the other is not diverse... and there is a motion by the defendants to dismiss for want of diversity?</text>
            <text syncTime="279.709" offset="1262968">The plaintiff then says,</text>
            <text syncTime="281.415" offset="1269760">"Oh, but only one of those defendants is the "real party whatever", and I can drop the other one, because the other one is not the "real party in interest"? "</text>
            <text syncTime="293.793" offset="1319288">Now, that's a situation where courts, even if this court has never had that problem, have said,</text>
            <text syncTime="299.279" offset="1341231">"If the second defendant, the non diverse defendant, is a "real party", you can't get rid of the case that way, but if it's not... if it's not, you can keep the... just drop it and keep the case going against the "real party in interest". "</text>
            <text syncTime="317.122" offset="1412598">There are such cases.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="318.707" stopTime="357.933">
            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>

            <text syncTime="319.610" offset="1422629">And the analysis goes to whether or not... how far along in the proceeding the litigation has occurred before the plaintiff makes that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.279" offset="1461290">Of course, a plaintiff can voluntarily drop defendants, without any consequences, and the courts have fairly uniformly held that it... that it is no jurisdictional bar for a plaintiff to drop a non diverse defendant in order to ensure that diversity would be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.091" offset="1532552">Had this complaint been brought in Federal court, there is no doubt that the court would have had original jurisdiction, because, on the face of the complaint, the two named defendants were completely diverse.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.933" offset="1575915">Ah, but the plaintiff said,</text>
            <text syncTime="358.994" offset="1580095">"This is a complicated real estate business, and I want to discover whether there is... whether the 'true defendant' is a Virginia citizen, as I am. "</text>
            <text syncTime="377.399" offset="1653760">So, on the face of it, it looks like there's complete diversity, but, in fact, the diverse defendant is hiding the "real party".</text>
            <text syncTime="390.536" offset="1706318">I think that's the position that the plaintiff was taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.447" offset="2049881">There was a high degree of imprecision in the deposition questions, and it's fairly clear, I think, that the lawyer and the witness did not understand what each other were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.706" offset="2090945">Yet in the discovery process, not a single question was presented that would get at the organizational structure of Lincoln.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.458" offset="2309956">And Mr. Franzen is a partner in some deals, but the testimony that was provided in a declaration... and it is appended to our reply brief... demonstrates that Mr. Franzen was not a partner in any deal that had anything to do with the Westfield Village Apartments.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.367" offset="2377561">But what the court of appeals did was, it erected a burden of proof that said that the defendant has to prove a negative, that there is not some affiliate corporation out there that is a citizen of the Commonwealth that would be existing to destroy diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.653" offset="2438792">And that type of burden, to prove a negative, has never been authorized in this court's cases.</text>
