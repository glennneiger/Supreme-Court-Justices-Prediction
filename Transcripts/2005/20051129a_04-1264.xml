            <text syncTime="9.276" offset="191707">This case presents the question whether a party can avoid arbitration by challenging the validity of the underlying contract containing an arbitration clause as opposed to the arbitration clause itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.583" offset="240922">We believe that this Court answered that question almost 40 years ago in Prima Paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.201" offset="263387">The Florida Supreme Court tried to distinguish Prima Paint on State law grounds, holding that the challenge at issue there, fraud in the inducement, would have rendered the contract voidable under State law, whereas the challenge at issue here, illegality, would have rendered the contract void under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.652" offset="345202">We respectfully submit that this distinction misses the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.312" offset="359831">Prima Paint held that a party cannot avoid arbitration by challenging the validity of the underlying contract as opposed to the arbitration clause because an embedded arbitration provision is severable from the underlying contract as a matter of Federal substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.557" offset="432765">Thus, the nature of the State law ground, on which the underlying contract is challenged, and the State law severability implications of that challenge are irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.593" offset="480935">What matters, as a matter of Federal law, is that a challenge to the underlying contract does not allow a court to deny arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.119" offset="514998">Rather, that challenge must be presented to the arbitrator in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.441" offset="744353">And given that the whole premise of arbitration in the first place is that it's a matter of consent, we would say that that particular challenge, as the lower courts have recognized since Prima Paint, an assent based challenge to the underlying contract, is again an... an exception or an asterisk to the otherwise bright line rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.276" offset="1347677">The State itself makes a decision that certain contracts can't be entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.632" offset="1369098">And the question of voidability is usually one affecting the... the will of the contracting party.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.491" offset="1408491">--Your Honor, you're entirely correct, and I think again the... the insight of Prima Paint is that you are perfectly able to present your challenge to the underlying contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.922" offset="1450286">The question is, who is the person to... which is the forum in which you present that?</text>
            <text syncTime="329.006" offset="1470557">Are you allowed to... to present that in court or... or are you relegated to... or are you required to submit it to the arbitrator pursuant to your agreement?</text>
            <text syncTime="337.934" offset="1506293">And... and I think the Prima Paint court recognized that if you allow parties to avoid arbitration altogether by bringing whatever challenges they may have to the underlying contract, whether it be fraud in the inducement or illegality or... you know, there are obviously any number of grounds for challenging contracts under State law... you effectively vitiate the arbitration agreement, the... the whole point of which is that we're going to... we've chosen the arbitrator as... the arbitration as the correct forum to resolve our dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.360" offset="1647981">And... and so again, as long as you are not challenging arbitration specifically... the arbitration law specifically, then it' s fair game to send you to arbitration, again where you are perfectly entitled to raise the whole panoply of challenges that you may have.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.428" offset="1780265">Well, Your Honor, again, I think the... the Federal Arbitration Act, both section 4 and section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, certainly permits that... that way of looking at it because section 4, as Prima Paint emphasized, says, you know, once the making of the arbitration agreement is clear, it must go to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.329" offset="1859886">And section 2 says it's the arbitration provision in a written contract... or the written provision in a contract that shall be valid and enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.518" offset="1900637">And so, both those provisions do distinguish between the arbitration provision specifically and, in fact, treat it as an underlying contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.952" offset="1930417">And again, I don't think there's any shame in admitting that Prima Paint, I think, recognized the important policy implications of a contrary rule, that--</text>

            <text syncTime="468.425" offset="2028220">So the answer to everything you said could be, fine, if this were proceeding in, say, the Southern District of Florida, but it's in the State court.</text>

            <text syncTime="486.119" offset="2099064">--Your Honor, it is certainly true that Prima Paint itself arose from Federal court and that the decision is, I think, rather carefully written to talk about Federal courts as a... in fact, Justice Harlan concurred in Prima Paint to say he would have affirmed the Second Circuit in that case on the basis of the Lawrence case, which said that this rule applies in Federal and State court, the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.386" offset="2216092">But the Court was obviously unwilling in Prima Paint to cross the bridge of saying that our rule applies in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.116" offset="2243051">And I think that, frankly, that's why it's written in that way of... of focusing on section 4 and not really specifically addressing section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.425" offset="2280249">This Court, however, subsequently confronted that issue head on in the Southland case and held that the substantive provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, really relying on Prima Paint for the proposition that the... the Federal Arbitration Act does create Federal substantive law enacted under the commerce power... it says that that rule... those rules of substantive arbitration law apply in State as well as Federal court because you really wouldn't want to attribute to Congress kind of a... a reverse Erie presumption of creating substantive Federal law that applied only in diversity cases in Federal court which would then promote forum shopping between Federal and State courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.045" offset="3334760">But I think the insight of the cases, really over the last 30 years in this Court, is that arbitrators are perfectly able and certainly have to be presumed to be able to decide legal and public policy questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="837.343" offset="3503929">Basically... and I think the Florida Supreme Court was very forthright about this... they said it's any challenge that leads to the contract being void as a matter of State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1315.469" offset="5416406">That is absolutely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.211" offset="5419436">And... and again, I would think he would not have an interest in... in saying that a contract for murder is perfectly valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.441" offset="5448275">You're absolutely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.112" offset="5450992">It wouldn' t get him more money in his pocket and it certainly would, I think, lead to the reputation of a rogue arbitrator out there who is not to be trusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.150" offset="5487145">And... and presumably that person wouldn't... wouldn't get much business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.127" offset="5507103">Again, so I think that the key point here is that the respondents have tried to create a lot of State law issues regarding void, voidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.921" offset="5566244">And... and I think as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the problem is it's kind of like trying to put a square peg in a round hole, that whether something is void or voidable under State law, which may vary from State to State, kind of misses the whole point which is the genius of a Federal separability rule is we don't care about those State law issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.761" offset="5645656">You don't have to get into that bog to decide the arbitrability question or the... you know, you cannot avoid arbitration by simply coming up with all those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.630" offset="5685049">And whether it's ground A for challenging the underlying contract and whatever the severability implications may be of ground A or ground B, the point is when you're not challenging the arbitration clause, it's fair game to send you to arbitration, and then you can raise ground A or ground B or whatever ground you have before the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.587" offset="5760909">And it's simply not a basis for avoiding arbitration altogether to be talking about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.776" offset="5785673">And again, the... the point... I think this is all kind of a common sensical point that you want to get parties quickly to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.578" offset="5816915">I mean, if you... if you have a situation where the parties have to spend years in court litigating these kind of issues, that really, in and of itself, defeats the whole point of... of arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.856" offset="5866025">Well, Prima Paint certainly displaced the States and State law from this area in a very substantial... to a very substantial extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.796" offset="5905731">I'm curious now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.280" offset="5911687">Have there been any attempts in Congress to overrule Prima Paint?</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.962" offset="5926420">I'm not aware of any, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.445" offset="5932376">And to the contrary, I think the Federal Arbitration Act has been amended multiple times since 1967 and it has always been in a pro arbitration direction, as this Court emphasized in the Allied Bruce case where there was a concerted attack not on Prima Paint, but on Southland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.043" offset="6006773">And in a sense, Southland is really a... a reflection of Prima Paint because Southland simply says that the... the substantive Federal arbitration law that was announced in Prima Paint sensibly should not be limited to Federal court, but should also apply in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.379" offset="6084095">So I think the... the Court faced a fork in the road in Prima Paint about the meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.869" offset="6110009">Was it just a procedural provision that governed in... in Federal proceedings based on Congress' power over the Federal courts and their procedures?</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.917" offset="6146267">Or was it a substantive provision enacted under the Commerce Clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.815" offset="6157865">And this Court took the latter approach and made that absolutely crystal clear in... in Southland and then later again in Allied Bruce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.484" offset="6196526">And so what I think the respondents are really asking you to do here is to really overrule root and branch the whole Federal substantive law of arbitrability altogether and say, well, this should just be... you took the wrong path back in 1967 and... and you should just interpret the FAA to be a... a procedural statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.743" offset="6289522">We would respectfully submit that that would cause an earthquake in the law in terms of arbitration and, therefore, would respectfully urge you to reverse the Supreme Court of Florida's judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.175" offset="6371233">This Court has repeatedly said that Federal law preempts State law only where Congress clearly and manifestly intended for it to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.941" offset="6406342">And the Court has also repeatedly said that the best guide to what Congress intended was the language of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.491" offset="6432569">Now, petitioners have not pointed to any language of the Federal Arbitration Act itself that would create a separability rule for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.545" offset="6464752">And moreover, the language of the act itself and particularly section 2... and particularly section 2 the way it was followed in the Prima Paint case... actually strongly supports us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.389" offset="6508115">Section 2 says that an arbitration provision is enforceable if it is in a contract evidencing interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.893" offset="6542179">Now, to order of arbitration, they say, well, the... the threshold issue is whether there's an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.045" offset="6558793">Let's have the arbitrator decide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.399" offset="6564122">To order arbitration is to enforce the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.367" offset="6576033">That is enforcing the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.802" offset="6581780">But they want to enforce the act before we've determined if section 2 is met, before the requirements of section 2 are met.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.697" offset="6669343">The word agreement was used in section 4, and that's the... that provision, of course, is the provision that refers only to the... not only applies to the United States district courts, that refers to jurisdiction under title 28 and twice refers to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and that in the Southland case in footnote 10, this Court said doesn't apply in the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.185" offset="6747292">Section 2 doesn't use the word agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.852" offset="6757950">Section 2 uses the word contract, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.814" offset="6769862">And the word contract is a very different idea than agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.882" offset="6782087">If section 2 had said an agreement in interstate commerce or a transaction in interstate commerce, perhaps they would have a point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.377" offset="6828063">Contract is one of the most important words in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.773" offset="6837676">Now, when the Court in Prima Paint looked at this, in the first sentence, the very first sentence of Prima Paint, the Court said this case involves a contract involving the U.S. Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.478" offset="6884487">And in the first sentence, the Court said this case is a case involving contracting parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.525" offset="6904654">The Court didn't say we're going to see what the arbitrator thinks as to whether there's a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.570" offset="6924820">In Prima Paint, this Court did it the right way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.866" offset="6934015">They said section 2... does it apply first?</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.594" offset="6944987">Only if it does apply, only if once after we have crossed that Rubicon will we go to the next step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.419" offset="6964213">Then the Court in Prima Paint goes and discusses whether or not the interstate commerce prong has been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.416" offset="6988246">And there' s a long discussion of is this in interstate commerce or not, and they find that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.167" offset="7003188">Well, under their theory, under petitioner's theory, why should the Court be deciding interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.444" offset="7024295">Arbitrator... the interstate commerce issue goes to the whole contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.456" offset="7292415">One, I think you're worried about consumer contracts, and there are a lot of good arguments on your side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.444" offset="7316344">But this rule also applies to business contracts, and there what's bothering me is that... that the whole business community seems to have developed an arbitration system throughout the world that depends upon the distinction I just made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.518" offset="7376634">And if we decide for you, we're going to throw a large section of those contracts back into the laws of the 50 States and arbitration will be seriously injured as the commercial community has come to rely on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3112.102" offset="12603005">I think that the question of whether or not this is illegal will be something that's decided by the Florida Supreme Court, but that question... first of all, if this case is sent back to arbitration, the arbitration clause, of course, is on an individual basis and this case could never be pursued on an individual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.898" offset="12662146">If it's not done as a class action, it would be the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.304" offset="12671759">But moreover, the arbitrator is basically free to ignore what the ruling of the Florida Supreme Court is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.962" offset="12694433">You know, there was a ruling from the Third Circuit a few weeks ago that said that glaring errors of law are not grounds for overturning an arbitration decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.354" offset="12724004">So the Florida Supreme Court could come out and say this is plainly illegal, and then a row of arbitrators could come in and say, seems okay to us, and there's really not going to be a court challenge to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.281" offset="12759635">So I would not agree with that as a matter of... as a matter of practical reality, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.172" offset="12775204">This State law that we're talking about is not about hostility to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.976" offset="12806446">The rule that distinguishes between void contracts and the small universe of cases that are void ab initio is a rule that goes back something like a hundred years in Florida and it goes back hundreds more years through... it's come up in decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.003" offset="12866528">It has come up in decisions of English courts that go back that were traced by the contract professors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.146" offset="12887113">At the time that the Congress wrote the Arbitration Act in 1925, this distinction was set out in Corbin and in the First Restatement of Contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.879" offset="12918042">This is basic, core common law of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.173" offset="12935282">And the idea that in 1925 Congress wanted to throw out all of the basic core rules of contracts and, instead, replace them with some new Federal rule of contract, when they didn't define contract, and when they put it as a precondition before the act applies, the idea that general rules of State contract law are going to be tossed overboard is really going to be a dramatic change for this Court... for this Court' s jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.160" offset="13023158">In case after case, this Court has said arbitration clauses are as enforceable as other contracts, but no more so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.707" offset="13049385">And that was the basis of this Court's ruling in the EEOC v. Waffle House case just a few years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.604" offset="13069029">Just like petitioner here, the Waffle House was saying arbitration clauses are sort of super contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.134" offset="13095047">They are something so many businesses have relied on, as Justice Breyer says, that they are... that they are treated by a different and better set of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.213" offset="13119393">These are contracts which are just better and more important than other contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.571" offset="13132873">And this Court stopped and, in Justice Stevens' opinion in the Waffle Case, said slow down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.226" offset="13151472">First, you just have to treat these like other contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.275" offset="13163697">And here, there's no signature line for the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.883" offset="13174042">The EEOC didn't sign on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.236" offset="13179475">We're going to treat this like another contract, and by a 6 to 3 vote, this Court found that you couldn't enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.332" offset="13199851">They want to put the cart before the horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.507" offset="13208628">They want to enforce this Arbitration Act before its terms were met.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.470" offset="13224406">That is not what this Court did in Prima Paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.727" offset="13233496">Prima Paint did it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.959" offset="13238407">They said section 2 first and only if section 2 applies, then do we jump to the next point, you know, sort of dinner before dessert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.669" offset="13265261">And that was the appropriate approach because you have to find out if section 2 is there and cross that threshold before you start saying now that we're in the Federal Arbitration Act, how much fun would it be to apply section 4, the part that keeps talking about the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to cases in State court proceedings and apply a decision that was based entirely on language in section 4 to State court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.689" offset="13345300">That is simply an enormous expansion of the law in this area, and we urge the Court strongly to affirm the decision below.</text>

I think Justice Breyer was getting to this... that it has to be a... a contract that evidences interstate commerce to have the hook of commerce power for the FAA to apply in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.533" offset="13628677">That was enacted under the substantive commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.701" offset="13637349">Then the question arises... and this is really where they're hanging their hats in this case to say, well, you have the word contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.150" offset="13663158">The word contract brings with it all the bells and whistles of State law for a valid underlying contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.488" offset="13688549">The problem with that is that looking at it that way... I think this is the heart of this case... that completely undermines... or the severability rule says, we've got a different contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.962" offset="13746437">The underlying contract is... is there, and you can raise your challenge to that contract, but as long as you're not challenging the... the arbitration clause, then any challenge you have to the underlying contract goes to the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.568" offset="13820833">And again, I think the point is to say that, well, they don't deny that there's a severability rule, but to say that before you apply the Federal severability rule, you have to go and look at the underlying contract and ascertain all this is to deny the Federal severability rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.476" offset="14084461">I think that's the key point, that to say that the... you have to go to the... the validity of the underlying contract under State law and the severability implications of the challenge to the underlying contract before you... before you even get to the arbitration clause is essentially to negate the severability of the arbitration clause because the whole reason you're looking at the underlying contract is presumably to see whether or not the arbitration clause can fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.728" offset="14193444">So they cannot logically have a regime that says the arbitration clause is severable from the underlying contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3530.540" offset="14276722">And there they say, fine, there was a contract and therefore this arbitration clause, which is separable... you go to arbitration.</text>
