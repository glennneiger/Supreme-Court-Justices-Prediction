            <text syncTime="1572.258" offset="6444832">As the previous questioning suggests, the outcome of this case follows directly from Steiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.766" offset="6466775">The Portal Act, by its terms, applies only to activities that occur before the commencement of... before the commencement of, or after the conclusion of, the employees' principal activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.407" offset="7177410">Justice Scalia, you made the point, and I simply want to reinforce it, that the reference in... to 4(a)(2) is the same as the reference to 4(a)(1), but it's also the reference to principal activities in the concluding clause of Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.277" offset="7244806">If I could just take the Court to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.741" offset="7250762">The statute is obviously reproduced in a variety of places, but it's also at page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.506" offset="7269779">And so, after 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(2), there's this concluding clause, and the text frames the workday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.841" offset="7303111">And it says that the Portal Act, 4(a)(1) and (2), will apply to activities which occur... I'm quoting now...</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.347" offset="7325158">"which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases, such principal activity or activities. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.768" offset="7378866">And it simply follows, as a matter of the plain text, that when Steiner held that those activities, "such principal activities", include the donning and the doffing, that everything that happens between those two events is not encompassed by the Portal Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2684.249" offset="10892753">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.425" offset="10901426">The Portal Act excludes walking time from compensation only when it occurs outside the workday, before an employee commences, or after he ceases, his principal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.876" offset="10943222">And Steiner held that the term "principal activities" includes activities that are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.604" offset="10978122">It follows that when donning and doffing are integral and indispensable parts of the principal activities of the employees, then walking that occurs after donning, and before doffing, occurs within the workday, and it is not excluded from compensation by the Portal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.346" offset="11049175">Now, the employers in these cases have argued that the term "principal activities" does not encompass activities that are integral and indispensable parts thereof, and that Steiner did not so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.494" offset="11097762">But, at the very outset of its opinion, the court, in Steiner, posed the question presented as whether changing clothes and showering are compensable as part of the employee's principal activities, and had answered that question several pages later by stating that it agreed with the conclusion of the court of appeals in that case that the term "principal activities" includes activities that are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities, and that the activities in question in that case fit within that description.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.372" offset="11229211">Now, that was the only textual basis on which the court could have reached the conclusion that it did, because, if the only principal activities in that case had occurred on the production floor, then the changing of clothes at the beginning of the day, and the showering at the end of the day, necessarily would have been preliminary to and postliminary to said principal activities, and thereby expressly excluded from compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.543" offset="11789903">So, the statute itself tells you that the term "principal activities" has to mean the same thing everywhere it appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.596" offset="11822086">And since you have already interpreted that term, in Steiner, to include "integral and indispensable activities", that terminology has to appear everywhere in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2945.575" offset="11938069">It seems that there's a separate... second question, such as, How do we tell if the space in time between two different principal activities, because they're two very different types of activities, is a break or part of the continuous workday?</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.017" offset="11995852">Well, first of all, that question arises not under the Portal Act, which only applies before the principal activities begin and after they end, but under the Fair Labor Standards Act, itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.053" offset="12043918">And that question would be governed by the Court's prior decisions on what constitutes hours worked, together with the Department of Labor's regulations that address what constitute hours worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.543" offset="12097939">And... within the workday... and what the Department of Labor has said is, generally, everything within the workday is compensable, except for a meal period and except for a time period where there is a break that is so substantial that the employees can effectively use that time for their own purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.587" offset="12182053">And so, it says things like 5 to 20-minute breaks are not periods where the employee is not working, but they are resting for the further work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.139" offset="12224267">That is common in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.615" offset="12234193">And so, that would be an issue that would arise when you had a break that was much longer than that, probably at least a half hour, where you can actually effectively use that time for your own purposes and are not required, essentially, to stay around on the employer's premises and to wait or rest to begin your work anew.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.125" offset="13360280">I just have a couple of points I'd like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.702" offset="13370520">First, Justice Breyer, I want to start with the waiting times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.120" offset="13380238">I didn't actually have an opportunity to spend much time talking about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.925" offset="13387447">But I think the answer that the Solicitor General's Office has offered with respect to the waiting time simply illustrates the expandable nature of the workday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.231" offset="13420675">Their position--</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.685" offset="13426527">Justice Ginsburg... or Justice O'Connor specifically asked that question,</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.376" offset="13441260">"You're not saying that waiting time prior to engaging in a primary activity, in fact, starts the workday. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.581" offset="13462053">And the answer is, absolutely, it does, because they find that everything that is integral and indispensable triggers the start of the workday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.901" offset="13487340">So, put it into fairly graphic terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.870" offset="13499251">If you have to show up in order to put on a coat in order to go onto the floor in order to do your services, then the waiting time for that coat counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.825" offset="13535091">If, however, you also have to put in earplugs in order to get to the place where you have to get the coat, not only do putting in the earplugs count, under that theory, but, if you have to wait, you have that, and that extends the workday, and all of the walking in between that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.113" offset="13596218">So, if you're asking,</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.934" offset="13599457">"Is this going to become a significant liability? "</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.381" offset="13609279">the answer is clearly yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.585" offset="13614086">For very significant compensable acts... and, indeed, in this context, some of those compensable acts were found by the jury to be utterly diminimus... you're going to end up with significant waiting time, and you're going to end up with significant walking time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3388.738" offset="13710739">And they did that on the basis of 790.7(g), before you get to the footnote... because that's the tag to the footnote... as to what is... what is the ordinary meaning of wait... of preliminary and postliminary for waiting time?</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.335" offset="13761103">And the expectation is that if you're waiting to get your check, and if you're waiting to check in, the recognition is that those... those are completely fortuitous, just as it is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.332" offset="13797047">There's nobody who structured this arrangement so that you will end up spending time waiting.</text>

            <text syncTime="3424.947" offset="13855562">But they said no... it's irrelevant whether it's before or after, because waiting time isn't covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.240" offset="13872698">So, I don't see how they specifically decided, yes, waiting time is covered, but not pre donning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3452.079" offset="13964022">So, again, obviously, you're free to decline to decide issues, but it seems to me that one is posed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.893" offset="14035284">--Right, but that just goes to the question... I think it disposes of the issue of, if you have waiting time that otherwise looks to be fairly ordinary preliminary/postliminary activity, it, nevertheless, can be converted into primary activity under their interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.152" offset="14088365">And they clearly suggest that the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.540" offset="14097873">Our suggestion is, that's inconsistent with the way waiting time is handled under the regulations; and, therefore, the answer clearly should be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.223" offset="14128593">And, at a minimum, the Court ought to affirm that part of the Tum decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.225" offset="14144685">With respect to the holding of Steiner... I mean, it's important to put in mind, Steiner... one of the things... two things that Steiner focused on... it focused on Section 3.0, and it recognized that there are going to be situations where you're going to be able to bargain away clothes changing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.635" offset="14198288">And so, then you're in a situation where, for some... for... in some circumstances, because you've bargained away compensation for clothes changing, walking that takes place before or after that will never be compensable; in other situations, it will be compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.212" offset="14248548">That's an absurd outcome in a situation where Congress clearly had one thing in mind that it absolutely wanted to accomplish, and that was to ensure that walking, riding, traveling to the place where you actually perform the services for which you've been hired, has been... has... is excluded from being mandatorily compensated... Steiner doesn't deal with 4(a)(1); the language is as plain as it can be... are not... you know, unless specifically excluded by Section 4(a)(1).</text>
