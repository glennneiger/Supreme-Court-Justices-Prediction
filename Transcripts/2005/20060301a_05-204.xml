            <text syncTime="15.197" offset="280356">The Texas legislature passed a new congressional districting map in 2003 for only one reason, maximizing the number of Republicans who would represent the State of Texas in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.083" offset="323928">Even though the existing lawful map already had 20 of 32 districts which strongly favored the Republicans, lawmakers went to extraordinary lengths to lock in control of 22 districts, moving around 8 million people into new districts, abandoning concerns about compactness, wherever necessary, and most importantly, segregating the population by race and by politics into 32 districts which are extremely noncompetitive.</text>

            <text syncTime="71.424" offset="505322">Now, they started out by trying to engineer the defeat in the... in the legislative process, engineer the defeat of the six Democratic Congressmen who had managed to be elected in Republican leaning districts because they were moderate to conservative and they were, as the district court put it, able to appeal to voters to split their tickets and vote for them in 2002.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.699" offset="574390">By the end of the legislative process, they went further and decided to take the risk of eliminating one of only four districts in the State in which African Americans had an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice and also to eliminate one of the Hispanic opportunity districts in south Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.520" offset="641681">Now, in the latter case, they did try to replace that with another Hispanic opportunity district, but that was the one that we've called the land bridge district, District 25, which spans 300 miles, linking up urban concentrations of Latinos in Austin and in McAllen down on the Mexican border.</text>

            <text syncTime="3551.395" offset="14425139">There were only two other States with more than five Members of Congress that saw a minority of voters electing a majority of the delegation, and those were Illinois and Tennessee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3978.705" offset="16134383">And I would note the consequence of the rule that appellants are urging is that it would create an enormous incentive for the minority party in every State to attempt to deadlock the system, to shut down at the beginning of the decade any effort to adopt a map because if they're able to deadlock the system, if they are able, as happened in Texas, to flee the State and no map passes, the consequence of that... they would know for certain under appellants' rule... is a court will draw the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.600" offset="16261965">And under the Upham standard, the court map will reflect the preexisting policy judgments of the predecessor legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="4631.348" offset="18744956">But the legislature specifically... for example, unlike Bush v. Vera, there are no bloc-level cuts based on race.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.281" offset="18788738">Indeed, in district 23, what the legislature did, by and large, is go straight down Interstate 35 which cuts right in the middle of Webb County.</text>

            <text syncTime="4865.941" offset="19683379">And so all three of the prongs... what the district court found as a factual matter is that district 24 functioned as an Anglo Democratic district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.327" offset="19724862">And indeed, this case is unusual in that there were some extraordinary direct testimony that the way district 24 operates is not accidental, that in 1991, it was explicitly drawn by Anglo Democrats for the specific purpose of electing Anglo Democrats and only Anglo Democrats.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.664" offset="19802289">And that was testimony not from a State witness but from Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Democratic African American incumbent from the adjoining district who was in the State legislature in 1991, and she said the African American population there was deliberately split up to create a district that would be... elect white Democrats.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.264" offset="19880656">That direct testimony is extraordinary and it shows that what the data demonstrate, which is that white Democrats control the district... and that's what the district court found as a factual matter... is not an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.775" offset="19926736">It was precisely the intended effect of the map-drawers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.071" offset="19939902">Indeed, if one looks to the three races that the appellants' experts examined that were African American versus Anglo in the primaries, of those three races, an African American candidate of choice who was black prevailed in only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4945.549" offset="20001760">Of the 20 races appellants' experts examined, of those 20, only one black candidate prevailed, and that case, the district court found, was aberrational because that candidate was Ron Kirk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.842" offset="20050974">He was a former mayor of the City of Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.574" offset="20057871">He was a very popular, local politician with a strong friends and neighbors effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.714" offset="20078455">If you take that aberrational case out, the two other cases appellants' experts looked to both showed that the African American candidate, one of whom was supported by 76 percent of African American voters, lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.646" offset="20134148">And indeed, what happened was the Anglos and the Hispanics voted in virtual unison against the African American candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.267" offset="20164659">That data... if one looks to the endogenous races, there had never been an African American opponent to Martin Frost, or the exogenous races, those three we talked about... the data demonstrate quite persuasively that African Americans were drawn into a district where they did not have an equal opportunity to elect their candidate of choice because they lacked the ability to elect a black candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.274" offset="20256715">Now, they could choose to do otherwise, but in this district, they could not choose to elect a black candidate.</text>

            <text syncTime="5052.960" offset="20431422">The district court made a finding that the reason district 23 was altered was to increase the chances of Congressman Bonilla prevailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.878" offset="20467157">And in particular, if one looks to Webb County, which is the county that was split, Webb County centers on the City of Laredo.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.624" offset="20494116">And in 2002... the race that the GI Forum appellants focus on principally... the candidate that ran against Congressman Bonilla was Henry Cuellar, a popular, local politician from Laredo, and he had a very strong following in Laredo.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.072" offset="20551898">And as a consequence, Mr. Cuellar did very well in that election, came within slightly under 4 points of beating Mr. Bonilla and Mr. Bonilla's percentage of the... of the Latino vote dropped to its lowest historic point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.895" offset="20607174">That, as the district court found, was also aberrational because of Mr. Cuellar's very strong local support, and the clearest evidence of that is under the new map, when half of Webb County was placed in the adjoining district, district 28, Mr. Cuellar ran against the incumbent Democratic Congressman, Ciro Rodriguez, and beat him in the primary, which demonstrates that his success was because the... the voters in Laredo are supporters of Mr. Cuellar and, accordingly, voted for him against either opponent, Henry Bonilla or Mr. Rodriguez.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.241" offset="20740607">And so, when the legislature was determining which section of voters to remove for political reasons, the region that voted heavily against Mr. Bonilla in the preceding election, Laredo, Webb County, was a natural place to move voters who had in the last election demonstrated they would vote for his opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.779" offset="20814690">Under any assessment of 23, the prior map had five districts that were indisputably Hispanic opportunity districts, plus district 23 that elected Congressman Bonilla, an Hispanic Republican.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.399" offset="20873205">The current map has six districts that are indisputably Hispanic opportunity districts, plus district 23 which elects Henry Bonilla.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.349" offset="20904969">So the result is the same in district 23, and there is an additional Hispanic opportunity district in district 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.362" offset="20933077">If I may turn to district 25 and return to Justice Kennedy's questions earlier about racial gerrymandering with respect to that district.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.780" offset="20962752">The first indicium this Court has looked to in racial gerrymandering case... cases is unusual or bizarre shape, and on that indicium, this district does not fall anywhere near the districts this Court has struck down as racial gerrymanders.</text>

            <text syncTime="5220.907" offset="21103187">In whatever district they're in, they're going to have to connect with a population zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5225.388" offset="21121159">And what the district court found as a factual matter is that the elongated nature... the relatively elongated nature of district 25 was a function of the geography and the fact that you have population along the border and then you have a large space of relatively low population, and then you have to get back up to population.</text>
            <text syncTime="5242.944" offset="21191376">So Texas historically has run north-south districts to get enough population to form a congressional district under this Court's one person/one vote precedents.</text>

            <text syncTime="5263.092" offset="21271938">The State defendants introduced at trial a Cromartie analysis that was precisely drawn from this Court's first Cromartie decision, Hunt v. Cromartie, and it's found on pages 331 and 332 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.399" offset="21329198">And what that analysis did is precisely what this Court found in Cromartie I was sufficient on summary judgment to defeat a claim of racial gerrymandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.270" offset="21368695">It assessed the lines in Travis County, the northern part of district 25, and it asked are the cuts the legislature made driven by politics or driven by race.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.392" offset="21413208">And so what the State's expert did is drew a map that would be based on race that would maximize the Hispanics in district 25 on the northern end of Travis County.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.652" offset="21458243">He then compared that map to the map that the legislature had drawn and said what are the differences between what it would look like if the legislature was attempting to maximize race as compared to what it would look like if it was attempting to maximize party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5322.100" offset="21507980">And what the State's expert found is there was on the order of a 1 percent differential which is you're talking between 24 and 25 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.987" offset="21543507">So it was about 4 percent differential of fewer Hispanics in the State's map and more Democrats in the State's map.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.500" offset="21573600">And so what the State's expert found is precisely along the lines as the evidence in Cromartie I that the legislature had drawn the map looking for Democrats rather than looking for Hispanics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.604" offset="21621978">In addition, if one examines the two numerical measures of compactness, smallest circle and perimeter to area, smallest circle this map measured 8.5, which is smaller than North Carolina's reconfigured district 12 upheld in Cromartie, which was 8.6 Its perimeter-to-area score, 9.5, is terribly low.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.111" offset="21712049">As a... as a means of comparison, districts 18, 29, and 30 that this Court struck down in Vera had perimeter-to-area scores of 106, 144, and 69, as compared to district 25's score of 9.5.</text>

            <text syncTime="5746.507" offset="23205626">And so it drew in the districts it was required to draw because Texas had two new districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="6233.793" offset="25154778">She's arguing they should have been more aggressive drawing lines on... based on race, which is... which is not an argument that sounds in the Shaw line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.587" offset="25185916">What the district court found is that it was purely a political motivation that drew that decision, and if one is looking to the Voting Rights Act, under any assessment, the district is performing identically as it did before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6255.254" offset="25240565">And on the totality of circumstances, either based on the region, in which case their argument... argument is one for maximization... they have six of seven districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="6289.772" offset="25378700">But it was their own expert who provided the information that the district court found credible, that there was no cohesion, that African Americans couldn't elect their candidate of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.049" offset="25411823">And it is undisputed that in new district 9, African Americans can elect their candidate of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.828" offset="25434916">And so from a statewide... from a totality of circumstances perspective, the ability to elect a candidate of choice for African Americans in the State is higher under this map than it was in the preceding map.</text>
            <text syncTime="6314.870" offset="25479115">In sum, the basic question here is whether courts or legislatures are the principal decision-makers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6322.336" offset="25508894">If appellants' proffered rule is adopted, it removes the safety valve that the Constitution provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="6329.458" offset="25537420">It is rarely employed because it is rare that one finds a plan so out of step with the demonstrated preferences of voters for a decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="6338.908" offset="25575245">We are aware of no other plan that allowed a minority of voters who never crossed the 44 percent threshold to control the majority of the delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6348.014" offset="25611608">We're aware of no other map in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6350.153" offset="25620176">And so if there is a standard that this is impermissible, that consequence would either elevate courts above legislatures, contrary to the constitutional text and to 4 decades of this Court's precedents, or that looks to substance, it would call into question the districts and a hosts of other districts because on any objective measure, the districts in Texas are fair as a partisan matter, compared to the other States, compared to the predecessor map, compared to any metric that one applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6380.641" offset="25742116">Indeed, the social scientists say, based on the seats/votes curve, that given that Republican voters are currently voting at roughly 60 percent for Republican candidates, one would expect a higher percentage of Republican candidates elected than... than what this map is yielding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6395.745" offset="25802615">And so on any coherent measure of a substantive measure of fairness, this map should survive.</text>

            <text syncTime="6478.477" offset="26133534">--Well, that's true in the context that the Court said it in the Shaw II case, but we don't think that the principle of Shaw II would apply to the section 2 claim in the south and west part of Texas in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6489.706" offset="26178465">And that's because in Shaw II, the Court found a violation in the southern part of the State and considered the question as to whether a creation of a district in a completely different part of the State, the middle of the State with no connection, would remedy the section 2 violation, and the Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="6505.669" offset="26242308">This case deals with a section 2 claim which is addressed to a particular region of the State, a region that's marked by its high concentration of Hispanic citizen voting age population, as well as common geography and other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6519.132" offset="26296120">And we know that the claim is addressed to that particular region of the State because that... that region is the focus of the plaintiffs' demonstration plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="6578.717" offset="26534462">In... in the De Grandy case, this Court confronted a very similar problem where you had one part of the State, the Miami-Dade area of Florida, which had a high concentration of Hispanic citizen voting age population, and the State was drawing various districts in that part of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="6594.055" offset="26595797">And the Court looked to those districts and considered whether there was a proportional representation of the minority group in that area and... and found that, under the totality of the circumstances, there was, and therefore, there was no violation of section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="6608.236" offset="26652535">Here, you have a situation where the district court found that the citizen voting age population in the south and west part of the State was 58 percent, and that under the State's plan, Hispanics enjoyed 85 percent majority minority districts in that area, which is to say, six of the seven districts under the State's plans were districts in which Hispanics enjoyed a majority of the citizen voting age population.</text>
            <text syncTime="6633.179" offset="26752323">The decision within that area of where to draw district lines is a decision that section 2 and this Court's precedents leave up to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6642.254" offset="26788581">And, in fact, in the De Grandy case, this Court in... in particular considered the situation where a district line ran through a minority neighborhood and split up that neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="6653.717" offset="26834452">The Court discussed it on page 1015 of its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6658.450" offset="26853365">And it said that the fact that the district line went through that neighborhood and had an effect on minority voters, in terms of which district they went into, didn't in itself establish a section 2 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6669.039" offset="26895787">And we think the same principle would apply here, where the fact that the district lines separating district 23 and 28 in the southern part of the State near Laredo splits a Hispanic neighborhood, which is, after all, not... not surprising given that the large percentage of the population in that part of the State is Hispanic, doesn't in itself establish a section 2 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6692.357" offset="26988992">The plaintiffs' section 2 claim in that part of the State really sounds very much in a section 5 retrogression or dismantling claim, and this Court made clear in the Holder v.

            <text syncTime="6824.648" offset="27518233">As we have explained in our brief, that claim... and I'm now turning to the Dallas/Fort Worth claim... fails because of the district court's finding that African American voters in old congressional district 24 lacked the ability to elect candidates of choice in that district in the sense that they would be unable, in a contested election, to put their candidate, the African American candidate, into office.</text>

            <text syncTime="7026.333" offset="28324894">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="7028.332" offset="28332940">As I understand the State's argument, it is that the rational, legitimate governmental purpose that was served in passing a new map in 2003 was to eliminate an anti-majoritarian map drawn by the Federal district court in 2001.</text>
            <text syncTime="7043.545" offset="28393753">I submit to you that's an odd use of the word in a couple of different senses.</text>
            <text syncTime="7048.073" offset="28411934">First of all, as the experts for both sides found and as the court itself found, that... the court-drawn map was not unfair or biased in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="7058.352" offset="28452999">It did not in any way maldistribute voters in a way that... that hurt... hurt Republicans' chances to elect Members of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7067.237" offset="28488525">So when Mr. Cruz says that the problem with the old map was that a minority of voters were controlling the delegation, that is factually untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="7075.812" offset="28522798">What happened was that Republican districts chose to elect moderate to conservative Members of Congress who happened to be affiliated with the Democratic Party rather than the Republican Party, but that does not mean that Democrats were controlling the delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7090.057" offset="28579849">The anti-majoritarian name is odd in another way because the map that replaced it, of course, is terribly anti-majoritarian, as the experts for both sides agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7100.521" offset="28621645">It totally flunks any... any kind of standard analysis about bias in the map to the point where it locks in 22 to 10 regardless, essentially, of how anybody votes in the State of Texas, and it's going to produce majorities that are going to average about... margins of victory that are about 40 percent in... for the rest of the decade, even if the Democrats gain votes over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7125.214" offset="28720493">Now, it's a dangerous road we're going down, I submit to you, if we start authorizing this kind of partisan festival every couple of years adjusting the lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="7134.633" offset="28758109">Now, we've had three States redo their congressional districts already in this decade, and if this Court were to uphold this one, I think we'll start seeing lots and lots of other ones tit for tat around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="7145.128" offset="28800114">There's another particular aspect of this that I think is potentially dangerous, which is as you get further into the decade, the census numbers get older and older and more and more out-of-date.</text>
            <text syncTime="7154.015" offset="28835640">And what the line-drawers then do is they've got the census numbers over here, they know where the real people are over here, and they can exploit that differential using the old census numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="7163.605" offset="28873988">So it seems to me that even if you're going to say there's a legitimate public purpose for redrawing the lines through the decade, we ought to require the States to come up with fresh numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="7172.132" offset="28908156">The population... one person/one vote requirements are so incredibly strict in the congressional area.</text>
            <text syncTime="7176.960" offset="28927487">Simply to sort of assume that these people can use the old numbers when they're redrawing the lines 5 years after the census seems... seems mistaken to me and it does invite terrible abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="7188.626" offset="28974089">There... and there are mechanisms for getting new census numbers if the States really feel it's important to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="7193.827" offset="28994883">Let me then turn, if I might, quickly to respond, I think, to Justice Stevens' question about what the record shows about the intent for taking the... the African American community in Fort Worth and sending it up to Oklahoma, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="7205.197" offset="29040336">That intent is set forth in pages 87 to 88 of the jurisdictional statement appendix where the map-drawer himself... his testimony is quoted, and he explained that we had to find a Republican district in the... in the neighborhood that we could... we could tack them onto that could sort... that could, quote, handle that particular component of the current county population, which is to say a district sufficiently Republican that they would be completely disempowered for the rest of the decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="7230.109" offset="29140019">Now, there was... there was a comment from Mr. Cruz about how the district 24 was created for a Anglo... Anglo Democrat to win.</text>
            <text syncTime="7239.075" offset="29175859">The district that... that was talked about in the testimony was the district drawn in 1991.</text>
            <text syncTime="7244.057" offset="29195817">What Mr. Cruz didn't point out was that in 1996, that district was completely changed by a Federal district court in Bush v. Vera.</text>
            <text syncTime="7251.163" offset="29224238">The old district went way down into the southeast into the countryside.</text>
            <text syncTime="7254.505" offset="29237613">The new district, which is the one you see in the maps before you, was drawn by the Federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7259.426" offset="29257257">It wasn't drawn by anybody seeking to uphold any Anglo Democrats' opportunities.</text>
