            <label>Mr. Raymond G. Kuntz</label>
            <text syncTime="7.420" offset="176939">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="10.356" offset="188642">The statute awarding attorneys' fees as part of the costs to the prevailing parents provides a clear rule, imposes a certain obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.580" offset="233573">It should not be expanded to include fees for expert witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.448" offset="253008">This is a case of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.650" offset="265860">Under longstanding rules, statutes are construed by first looking at the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.554" offset="289475">Is the meaning plain?</text>
            <text syncTime="36.887" offset="294804">If so, the inquiry stops there.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.089" offset="303581">This statute is unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.541" offset="317373">Expert fees are not a part of attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.362" offset="336704">Expert fees are not costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.278" offset="344332">The statute contains no reference to expert fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.099" offset="363558">They are not shifted to the school district when the parents prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.551" offset="381426">It's our belief that the lack of compensation for experts is an intentional exclusion and omission from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.423" offset="412877">Congress knows how to add expert fees in a cost shifting statute, and that omission is telling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.994" offset="439208">In that context, I think it's important to draw the Court's attention to the origin of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.148" offset="467839">It was in response to this Court's decision in Smith against Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.052" offset="487378">At the time that Smith against Robinson was heard, the EHA was often grafted onto other causes of action as a pleading device to... in an attempt to ensure that attorneys' fees flowed to the prevailing party at the conclusion of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.197" offset="563969">So cases were brought not only under the... the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, but also under 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and under 1983 as well of... on the theory that these were equal protection claims brought under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.409" offset="640874">In Smith against Robinson, this Court made it clear that the avenue that had to be followed by the parents was exclusively that of... of the remedy provided under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.252" offset="700224">In response to that decision of the Court, as my opponent points out in his brief... I think it was 19 days later... bills were introduced into Congress to remedy what Congress at that point saw was a... a lack of coverage for fees for attorneys for the prevailing parties in cases under the... under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.998" offset="787160">So it's no... no great surprise that what Congress did in that instance was to take the language that appears in section 1988 and, in effect, lift it and put it into the... into the act, into what we now call the IDEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.377" offset="856750">And it's very clear that in doing so, it limited the right of recovery to attorneys' fees, and that right does not include the expert fees advocated by the respondents here this morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.468" offset="4077125">This Court should give the attorneys' fee provision of IDEA the same construction it gave the nearly identical language of section 1988 in Casey and hold that an award of attorneys' fees as part of the cost does not include expert fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.192" offset="4131982">Respondent's sole argument is that expert fees are included in the statutory term costs, but as this Court made clear in both Casey and Crawford Fitting, the term costs in a fee shifting statute has a well settled meaning and is a reference and is limited to those... that modest category of costs that may be awarded under 28 U.S.C. 1920 and 1821.</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.073" offset="4239502">Isn't... isn't it a fairly common practice for a... a trial lawyer to... to hire his experts and pay them and then bill the client for... for whatever he's paid for the experts?</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.983" offset="4323094">But it... it certainly has been done that way, and... and if that is still the practice, wouldn't it sense for Congress to have assumed that expenses would include those kinds of expenses?</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.187" offset="4459976">We don't think the term expenses in... in that provision can fairly be read to somehow dramatically expand the meaning of the phrase, attorneys' fees as part of the costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.959" offset="4499055">We think it's much more naturally to read that as just a reference, as this Court noted in Casey, to the common practice of including out of pocket expenses of attorneys for things like copying costs and... and necessary travel expenses and things like that as... as also being compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.385" offset="4564779">And so we don't think that that... that term expenses does anything dramatically to the meaning of the statutory provision at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.222" offset="4592051">And as far as subsection (B) of that provision related to the GAO, we think it's clear that it's no longer referring to the actual awards in cases, and is instructing the GAO to do a broader study about the time that's spent by attorneys and consultants and others on both sides in these cases because Congress was very concerned about the amount of litigation and the expense of that litigation and the diversion of funds away from the core educational services of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.955" offset="4703019">As this Court noted in Schaffer, that's one of the primary concerns Congress has had, especially in the more recent amendments to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.442" offset="4728933">And we think, in fact, that the... the fact that Congress instructed the GAO to study that is, if anything, more consistent with the idea that Congress decided not to legislate on the question of expert fees, but to leave it for another day after they've had the benefit of that study at a minimum.</text>

            <text syncTime="2642.849" offset="10718601">Much of the litigation in IDEA cases takes out... takes place outside the confines of Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.919" offset="10742843">Most of the litigation takes place in State due process hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.490" offset="10765204">And what I believe Congress was interested in making sure were the general rules, like rule 11, the general rules that punish parties for engaging in vexatious or frivolous litigation would have some analog in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.616" offset="10829674">And therefore, what the court... what... what Congress did was to authorize a Federal court, in reviewing an application for attorneys' fees incurred before a State administered tribunal, because that's where the action takes place in these cases, to... to be able to reduce an attorneys' fee award if there was misconduct by the parent or... or the lawyer, misconduct in the sense of trying to protract litigation or multiply proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.387" offset="10952763">And interestingly, Your Honor, the... the conference report addresses this issue and does explain... and now I'm quoting from page 6 of the... of the conference report, the joint explanation... that the court shall accordingly reduce the amount of attorneys' fees and related expenses otherwise allowable if they determine that this misconduct had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.169" offset="11051924">So I think that at least in the conference report, Congress is signaling that if there were other costs that were incurred unreasonably as a result of lawyers protracting or delaying a proceeding, they too would be subject to the same reduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3383.929" offset="13682977">Those... some of those are required members.</text>

            <text syncTime="3388.749" offset="13702203">It might have the... the service providers like the speech pathologist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.618" offset="13717667">And when... when it comes to a trial, comes to a due process hearing, those are the folks who come and testify as to what they know about the child, the test results they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.092" offset="13763538">There are no typical consultants or testimonial experts that appear for the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.878" offset="13778689">So the... the central part of this statute, its... its revolution, where it brings parents of children who are disabled into contact with the... with the school, has had a wonderful effect in fulfilling the promise of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.974" offset="13859146">Energizing the litigation aspect of this by transferring those costs to the school district will... will take away and will detract from the... the true meaning of the statute, which was to build a partnership between the parents and the school district, not to let it dribble off into litigation.</text>
