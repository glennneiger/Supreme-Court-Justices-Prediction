            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="88620">The second opinion for the Court is in Hill versus McDonough, No. 05-8794.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.571" offset="134804">Death-row inmate Clarence E. Hill seeks to bring an Eighth Amendment challenge to the sequence of drugs Florida would likely use to execute him by lethal injection.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.040" offset="180780">We granted certiorari to decide whether Hill can bring his challenge pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983 -- that’s the federal statute that allows individuals to sue state actors for violations of federal rights -- or whether he must seek a writ of habeas corpus under the rules and conditions set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.328" offset="277851">So the question is whether or not he must proceed under Section 1983 or habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.665" offset="299271">The question of which of the two statutes governs has significance, because they carry different restrictions and allow different forms of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.517" offset="330618">In this case, Hill filed a suit under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.176" offset="349322">The United Stated District Court for the Northern District of Florida held that the suit was the equivalent of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and that that statute, the habeas-corpus statute, barred Hill’s suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.852" offset="400000">The Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit affirmed, and we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.962" offset="416404">A challenge to the lawfulness of confinement or a sentence must proceed as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.098" offset="440960">In Nelson v. Campbell, decided in 2004, the Court addressed an inmate’s Eighth Amendment claim, and the question was whether or not that was a challenge to the lawfulness of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.193" offset="485368">In Nelson, the inmate challenged an invasive surgical procedure the State planned to use during his lethal-injection execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.047" offset="520790">This Court held that the suit could proceed under 1983, because it did not seek an injunction that would bar the lethal injection itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.682" offset="551301">The procedure the state proposed to use was not mandated by law, and the inmate appeared willing to concede the existence of an acceptable alternative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.955" offset="588395">We conclude today that Hill’s 1983 action is controlled by our decision in Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.035" offset="608666">The particular sequence of chemicals Hill challenges is not required by Florida law.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.031" offset="632698">Hill concedes the existence of a Constitutional alternative, and the state has not thus far contended it lacks a practical legal alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.558" offset="666762">One concern is that the foregoing analysis may be more theoretical than real.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.855" offset="687973">The states and its amici contend that the law must recognize how inmates file suits like Hill’s only to forestall execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.488" offset="718484">To address this concern, United States as Amicus Curiae proposes that we deem Hill’s suit a habeas action, because he has not offered an acceptable alternative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.821" offset="755892">Specific pleading requirements, however, are mandated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and not through case-by-case determination of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.919" offset="788284">As for other arguments made by the respondents and State amici, they are foreclosed by the controlling decision in Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.472" offset="818481">Our conclusions do not diminish the State’s and crime victim’s important interests in the timely enforcement of a sentence, nor do they deny federal courts the means and the duty to protect those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.590" offset="866964">A stay of execution is an equitable remedy; it is not available as a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.428" offset="886295">Courts must apply a presumption against granting a stay where a claim could have been brought in time to consider the merits without delaying the sentence, and indeed a number of federal courts have invoked their equitable powers to dismiss challenges to execution procedures they saw as speculative or filed too late in the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.359" offset="957975">The equities and merits of Hill’s actions are not before us, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.020" offset="972604">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.448" offset="990367">This opinion is unanimous.</text>
