            <text syncTime="28.131" offset="259579">In the past, this Court has reconciled this conflict by drawing a line between sovereign power and sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.070" offset="291344">States are bound by Federal law, but the States are immune from monetary damages for violations of those laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="3137.145" offset="12695641">And that's how we distinguished the Nordic Village case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.381" offset="12708598">The... this Court, I believe, would be extending the Article... its jurisprudence if it permitted the bankruptcy estate not to be able to sue the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.522" offset="13013186">And the bankruptcy code assigns to the debtor in possession, or to the trustee, the ability to collect on behalf of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.994" offset="13063027">Bankruptcy is unique in its very in rem application and its very narrow and specialized enforcement of the bankruptcy system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.980" offset="13103047">The framers recognized the critical nature of binding the States in a uniform scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.190" offset="13231883">The question presented is whether or not Congress may use the Article 1 Bankruptcy Clause to abrogate sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.942" offset="13262916">In Alden versus Maine, this Court held that there was a presumption that the States had retained their immunity unless it could be shown by conclusive evidence that the States surrendered their immunity in the plan of convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.491" offset="13321012">If Congress can use the Article 1 bankruptcy power to abrogate sovereign immunity, then one would expect there to be discussions to that effect at the constitutional convention, in the federalist and antifederalist writings, and in the ratifying conventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.995" offset="13379109">Yet, as the Sixth Circuit conceded in its version of Hood, there is no compelling evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.419" offset="13404813">There is, at best, silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.215" offset="13411919">Silence cannot equal the compelling evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.185" offset="13423830">Therefore, the Article 1 bankruptcy power cannot be used to abrogate sovereign immunity.</text>
