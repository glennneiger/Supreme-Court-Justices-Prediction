            <text syncTime="8.505" offset="190125">In Mullane, this Court held that due process requires that notice efforts conform to what a person who actually desires to provide notice would do under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.263" offset="241116">Such a person would not turn a blind eye to the return of an initial mailed notice, but would consider reasonable follow up steps to provide that notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.844" offset="283539">Where valuable real property is at stake and the State learns that its initial effort has failed, the State should do two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.989" offset="316035">First, it should search readily available sources for a better mailing address and resend the notice, and second, if a better address cannot be readily ascertained or the second notice also fails, the State should post a notice on the property or contact the occupants.</text>

            <text syncTime="84.423" offset="493773">A reasonable person who actually desires to give notice will use certified mail for the information that comes back to the sender.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.596" offset="526478">Then the sender either knows the notice has been received and they can stop with confidence, or they know that they have failed and there's still time to take reasonable follow up steps.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.749" offset="647059">And if... if that satisfies due process, the State would never have known that it did not reach the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.893" offset="775686">So, in fact, what the State did here was no better than sending regular mail because they ignored the information that came back from the use of certified mail.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.304" offset="1013296">And as long as some of the people who were similarly situated received notice, they could act in a way that would protect other members of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.571" offset="1050390">Here, we're talking about real property with just a single owner, and in this case, where we have an $80,000 house that was lost and sold for only $21,000, it would seem to me that due process would require more than just regular mail.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.397" offset="1665730">And... and the point of my question is in figuring out what it is, what significance do we give to the affirmative obligation on the part of the property owner to keep the government informed of the address.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.864" offset="1743575">Then... then it has no significance ever because the... the State has an obligation to use the best address it has, whether he's got an obligation to... to keep the address updated or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.891" offset="1791640">And... and this is the... the tough point for me with your case.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.680" offset="1858827">Justice Souter, it has no significance once the State is actually informed that the notice has failed because I think the significance of the statute is it increases the State's confidence in the address that it's initially using.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.142" offset="1924656">But once the certified mail comes back unclaimed, at that point it knows that the address from 1967 in its records and the statutory obligation to update the address, that is outweighed by actual knowledge that in both 2000 and 2003 the certified mail notices were not received.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.113" offset="2020577">I'd like to go back to Justice Ginsburg's first question about why regular mail might actually have been better in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.878" offset="2051611">Had regular mail been sent, we don't know what would have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.180" offset="2068852">We might not have had the due process challenge because the envelope would have ended up in the mailbox at Bryan Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.690" offset="2094870">It would have been brought inside by the occupants, and they may very well have brought it to Mr. Jones' attention, the way they did when they received the eviction notice after the redemption period had closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.417" offset="2145756">But I think the most important factor, even if we don't agree on whether certified mail was required by the Constitution in the first instance, is that once the government used certified mail, it cannot then ignore the information that it gained as a result of that choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1467.860" offset="6027552">If the letter carrier followed proper procedure, the notice would have been left, but there's nothing in the record to indicate one way or the other whether that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.627" offset="6062661">But at most, that notice would say that there was a certified letter for Gary Jones and it may have said that it was sent by the Commissioner of State Lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.703" offset="6098919">It didn't say tax delinquent notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.711" offset="6106964">The county is who assesses the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.259" offset="6117100">Many lay people might think that the Land Commissioner of Arkansas was writing about the parks or the State forests or any number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.824" offset="6151373">So I don't think we can charge Mrs. Jones with knowledge that there was a tax delinquent notice waiting for Mr. Jones just because, if the letter carrier did what he or she should have, a notice of delivery slip would have been left at the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.269" offset="6225142">But remember also that after the first notice came back, it was 3 years later when they sent the notice of the negotiated sale, and that was after they knew that it was likely a futile gesture to send certified mail to Mr. Jones at that address, and it was after they had actually gone out and visited the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.640" offset="6306644">So at a minimum, they should have posted a notice at the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.912" offset="6323781">And while in some cases like Greene v. Lindsey or Schroeder v. City of New York, posting was inadequate, and the Court said that mail would have been better, at least here, knowing that mail had not worked, even if the State chose not to search for a better address, at a minimum they should have posted a notice at the property and that would have made all the difference in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.291" offset="6413328">If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.828" offset="6451467">It's somewhat startling to me that in a case involving a fundamental question of what notice is due under the Due Process Clause, that the phrase, reasonably calculated to provide notice to the affected property owner, was never used in the petitioner's submission because at least, as I remember Mullane I suppose from my law school days and... and since then, that is the fundamental test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.308" offset="6541328">The question is has the State undertaken to... to make a reasonable calculation to, in fact, provide notice under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.377" offset="6581662">It's sort of startling to me in the... in the face of a decision like this Court wrote in Mennonite Board, where it says explicitly, you know, the minor inconvenience and administrative burden of using the regular mails is a complete answer to claims that something less than that should be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.022" offset="6644251">And again, petitioner's counsel first answer to the question, would ordinary mail have been sufficient under these circumstances, is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.466" offset="6674030">For property like this, that's not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.905" offset="6687719">It seems to me that... that the Dusenbery case answers that because while it was true that the mails that were sent originally to the prison itself were certified, there's no certification process to get the mails--</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.408" offset="6757727">That is, I don't think... my understanding is that the post office, unlike FedEx and unlike UPS, if you're not home, they leave a... a notice, you know, and you check a box, and if you check the box, they'll leave it off the next day.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.801" offset="6879353">They say, oh... if you get through to a human being, which takes 15 minutes, after you go through the menu, they say, phone the post office branch.</text>

            <text syncTime="3203.412" offset="12969750">That line is a line of addresses that are very easily ascertainable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3213.032" offset="13008202">And it seems to me in this case, when the notice came back unclaimed, then the State was entitled to assume that either it had provided notice and he just didn't want to pick it up or, at worst, that his address was no longer very easily ascertainable, and at that point his obligation was only to publish notice, which it did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3420.104" offset="13836493">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.056" offset="13840359">First, I'd just like to point out that it absolutely is in the State's interest to provide the best notice practicable for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.219" offset="13872959">First, redemption of property by the owner is the most efficient and cost effective means for the State to collect the back taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.775" offset="13907232">Second, the State has an interest in protecting its citizens from a loss of assets in equity, like what was lost by Mr. Jones here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.702" offset="13942968">And third, if notice is received because of follow up efforts or if the State can show that it has made follow up efforts, then it will not face challenges based on inadequate notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.609" offset="13990510">In terms of the feasibility of doing something more, the question was raised about other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.748" offset="14015066">Certainly many States do more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.145" offset="14024679">We've listed about five or six States that actually have a statutory scheme that deals with what happens when initial mailed notice comes back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.378" offset="14057593">And in footnote 9 and footnote 10 of the reply brief, we indicate States that require posting and States that require notice to occupants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.066" offset="14096359">Justice Souter, with regard to your question about the cost of tracking down a better address or providing notice, those costs can be passed on to the redeemer or purchaser of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.424" offset="14145782">And if we look at the statute dealing with notice to homestead owners, it says that where the mail does not work, the additional cost of the notice by personal service of process will be paid by the owner of the homestead who redeems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.337" offset="14217462">So certainly they could pass along those costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.814" offset="14227389">They could pass along the costs of searching for a better address just like we do in the Freedom of Information Act context when we charge for Government employee time to search for records.</text>

            <text syncTime="3528.587" offset="14270439">With... with respect to the fact that your client did not alert the State to its change of address, is there anything in the record about whether that his separation was permanent or is that a gradual thing?</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.602" offset="14330520">I mean, did he not know if this was a permanent change of address or what?</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.811" offset="14343373">There's nothing in the record about that, Your Honor, but certainly when he first moved out, he did not know what the future would hold in terms of the length of that separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.241" offset="14385064">Now, it... it is also not in the record, but he did, in fact, file a change of address form, a forwarding form, but it had long expired before these certified letters came.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.466" offset="14429995">That was actually a mistake on the part of the letter carrier not to say, forwarding order expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.803" offset="14451310">And while a forwarding order is only good for 18 months, there is the national change of address database which reveals those things for a period of 4 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.471" offset="14489972">So that's something else the State could have checked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.776" offset="14499167">Also, this is not an attack on Dusenbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.685" offset="14510870">This would be Dusenbery all over again if Mrs. Jones had signed for the letter and the State had gotten back the green card saying that letter was received by somebody at 717 North Bryan Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.760" offset="14555173">Then it would be Dusenbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.984" offset="14560084">This is not Dusenbery because the difference is in Dusenbery they knew that the letter was actually received at the facility where Mr. Dusenbery was incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.608" offset="14594566">Here, the State actually knew that the letter had never been received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.701" offset="14610866">With regard to value of the property, that $80,000 figure is not picked out of the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.729" offset="14635004">It's true, as Mr. Phillips said, that the parties stipulated that that was the market value of the property, but in fact, by statute... and that's Arkansas Code Annotated section 26-26-303... the assessed value of property cannot exceed 20 percent of the market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.247" offset="14713057">The minimum bid was the assessed value, plus the interest, plus the penalties, plus the costs of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.570" offset="14742419">Ms. Flowers, in her negotiated purchase offer, made the minimum bid plus $200.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.711" offset="14770945">With regard to the fact that the letter came back unclaimed, I'd just like to point out that it... I see my time is up.</text>
