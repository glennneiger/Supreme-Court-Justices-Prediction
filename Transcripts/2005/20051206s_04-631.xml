            <text syncTime="9.132" offset="125214">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.605" offset="147157">Petitioner, the State of Kansas, imposes a tax on the receipt of motor fuel by distributors within its boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.413" offset="178399">Kansas supplies that tax to motor fuel received by non-Indian fuel distributors, who subsequently deliver that fuel to a gas station owned by, and located on, the reservation of Petitioner, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.022" offset="260737">The Court of Appeals determined that this application of the Kansas motor-fuel tax was an impermissible affront to petitionerâ€™s sovereignty and held that the tax was invalid under the interest-balancing tests that we set forth in White Mountain Apache Tribe versus Bracker.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.526" offset="342762">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.285" offset="365854">Under our Indian tax-immunity cases, the who and the where of the challenged tax have significant consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.180" offset="405456">We have determined that the states are categorically banned, barred, from placing the legal incidence of an excise tax on a tribe or on the tribal members for sale made on reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.101" offset="469090">We have further determined that even when a state imposes the legal incidence of its tax on a non-Indian seller, the tax is subject to an interest-balancing test if the transaction giving rise to tax liability occurs on reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.919" offset="544323">But this case presents neither scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.863" offset="556130">Here, Kansas places a legal incidence of its motor-fuel tax on the distributor who first receives motor fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.780" offset="591865">As such, the tax is imposed on a non-Indian, and it arises as a result of an off-reservation transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.383" offset="626243">We have never suggested that such a tax is subject to interest balancing, and we decline to do so today.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.409" offset="658321">Consistent with our cases holding that Indians venturing off the reservation are subject to nondiscriminatory state taxes, we hold that a state excise tax imposed on a non-Indian that arises as a result of an off-reservation transaction is not subject to interest balancing and that the Kansas motor-fuel tax is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.646" offset="755287">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Kennedy joins.</text>
