            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="8.434" offset="122938">Pennsylvania’s prison system has a policy of denying newspapers, magazines and personal photographs to a small group of about 40 inmates, who share the fact that they have particular problems of behavior, they flunked out of special disciplinary programs or in various other ways they have shown themselves what they characterize as ”the worst of the worst” in the prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.258" offset="230249">Now, a former inmate of that program attacked the policy here as unconstitutional, and the State defended it, and at the trial both sides moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.313" offset="274448">The District Court granted summary judgment to the State; the 3rd Circuit reversed; now, we are reversing the 3rd Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.308" offset="306422">So we think summary judgment was right in this case for the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.035" offset="325334">I am announcing the judgment of the Court here, and I’ll give the reasoning of four Justices; only eight of us are participating, Justice Alito is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.705" offset="360025">The four Justices are myself, the Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.554" offset="383431">In the view of the four of us, the case turns on three sets of legal requirements:  first, the Constitution permits policies in prisons that would otherwise be forbidden, policies that affect free speech, confinement and so forth, provided that those policies are reasonable ones in the circumstances, and a case called Turner elaborates on that; second, when we are looking at these matters, we owe prison officials a degree of deference when they exercise their professional judgment, and a case called Overton elaborates on that; and, third, on a summary-judgment motion, such as we have here in this case, the defendant makes a motion, the prison makes a motion for a summary judgment, and they have to show they're entitled to it, and then it’s up to the Plaintiff, who has the burden of proof, to point to evidence that raises a triable issue of fact, and a case called *2:12 Cellitex elaborates on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.308" offset="626474">So we have examined the record here, and we conclude that the trial court was right in granting summary judgment for the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.766" offset="656254">That's because the Secretary attached a deposition to his motion for summary judgment where a prison official explained the policy and explained its justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.807" offset="700453">In particular, the official explained that these are the 40 most corrigible inmates in the system; previously, they had been deprived of almost every privilege it’s possible to deprive them of, all without success; and the right to read magazines and newspapers and have some personal photographs is almost all that's left.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.008" offset="777253">They can escape the policy after 90 days by improving their behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.708" offset="796061">About 25% do that or have done that over the span of 2 years and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.580" offset="823542">Now, in response to the Secretary’s showing, the Plaintiff did not offer to present evidence by experts or by laypeople or even to cross-examine the prison officials further.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.309" offset="870458">Rather, the Plaintiff offered to present nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.506" offset="883310">He just said it was unlawful, provided reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.454" offset="895013">So given the deposition, the justification for the policy, the fact that it applies to a small group and is potentially temporary, in the absence of any contrary evidence, we conclude that summary judgment for the prison is warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.993" offset="957184">We are not saying the policy is immune from constitutional attack; we just say that the attack that we are seeing is the one contained in the record before us, and that attack could not succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.819" offset="1004518">We reverse the 3rd Circuit’s determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.809" offset="1016430">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Scalia joined; Justice Stevens filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Ginsburg joined; and finally, Justice Ginsberg also filed a dissenting opinion of her own; Justice Alito, as I said, took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
