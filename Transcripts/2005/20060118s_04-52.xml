            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="6.179" offset="113312">In Batson versus Kentucky, a decision decided by this Court in 1986, it was established that it is unconstitutional for a prosecutor to strike a prospective juror based on that juror’s race.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.671" offset="167333">A Batson challenge, in that case and in subsequent cases as it has developed, entails a three-step process:  first, the trial court must decide whether there is a prima facie showing of discrimination; second, if so, the prosecutor must provide a race-neutral explanation; and, third, the court then must determine whether the defendant has carried the burden of proving purposeful discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.645" offset="275166">Collins is the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.878" offset="284152">He was on trial for criminal charges in a California state court, the Superior Court for the State of California, in and for the County of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.194" offset="317380">After the prosecutor used her second peremptory strike on an African-American woman, defense counsel made a Batson objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.806" offset="347787">The trial court, satisfied with the prima facie step, went on to Step 2 and it asked the prosecutor to explain the basis for the challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.446" offset="378402">The prosecutor said she was concerned that the juror was young and likely to be lenient on drug offenses; lacks ties to the community; and had rolled her eyes in response to a question from the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.219" offset="425527">The prosecutor also indicated she was seeking gender balance in the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.087" offset="444962">The trial court had to go then to Step 3 and determine if there was racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.735" offset="463561">The trial court disallowed or discredited the prosecutor’s use of gender.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.253" offset="481638">It did credit the prosecutor’s other explanations, even though it had not seen the juror’s troubling behavior, and the California Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.929" offset="520299">After his conviction, the respondent filed a federal petition of habeas corpus, which the District Court denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.384" offset="546108">The Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.151" offset="557184">The Court of Appeals found that it was unreasonable to credit the prosecutor’s explanations.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.086" offset="576933">We now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.353" offset="589994">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, federal habeas-corpus courts may overturn state court factual findings only if there are unreasonable determinations in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.867" offset="660107">Although the Court of Appeals invoked this standard, we concluded it improperly substituted its judgment for that of the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.067" offset="688841">The Court of Appeals held any reasonable fact finder would have disregarded the prosecutor’s rendition of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.235" offset="713501">In our view, the record does not support this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.918" offset="728234">Reasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the prosecutor’s credibility; but on habeas review, that does not suffice to supersede the state court’s judgment on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.020" offset="776717">In reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals, we are unanimous; Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion, which Justice Souter has joined.</text>
