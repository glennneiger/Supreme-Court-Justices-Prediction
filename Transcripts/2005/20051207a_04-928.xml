            <text syncTime="3456.406" offset="13979278">First, on how this evidence was offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.030" offset="13989727">It was not offered as impeachment evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.828" offset="13996937">It was not offered under any State statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.609" offset="14008118">If you look in the joint appendix, the second volume, at page 94 is the notice of intent to rely on evidence of alibi as mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.190" offset="14050436">And then there's an accompanying memo that follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.081" offset="14057959">And, also, at page 88 of the joint appendix, there's a colloquy between defense counsel and the trial court, where defense counsel says, "Your Honor"... and made it very clear that alibi is being offered as mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.426" offset="14107383">It goes to the circumstances of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.959" offset="14117518">It's mitigating evidence that someone is not there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3516.246" offset="14218664">And let me just mention, in terms of the timing of the alibi evidence, the grandfather's alibi covered from 9 o'clock at night until 2 o'clock in the morning; the mother's, from 2:10 in the morning til 4:20.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.545" offset="14267879">The crimes occurred in the early morning hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.171" offset="14278328">And so, there isn't any way to parse this out and say that the alibi testimony might have been relevant, in some small piece, on deliberateness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.688" offset="14312392">To the extent that the State puts on additional evidence to establish deliberateness, of course defendant can respond to that additional evidence, but the State doesn't make the question of whether the defendant was there wide open again in the penalty phase.</text>
