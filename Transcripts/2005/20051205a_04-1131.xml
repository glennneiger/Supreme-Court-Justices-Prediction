            <text syncTime="145.427" offset="737508">With all respect, Justice Scalia, I think that's incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.016" offset="747852">The Civil Service Reform Act provides for judicial review of personnel actions, and if you go back to the opinion for the Court that you wrote in Fausto, you'll see that you repeatedly referred to them as personnel actions there.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.529" offset="793828">Now, a warrantless search of a Government employee, as this Court's opinion in Bush against Lucas says at note 28, is not a personnel action, and therefore, there is no way of obtaining review of it through the Civil Service Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.719" offset="846595">But it is not in any sense here a minor violation of Mr. Whitman's rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.689" offset="950562">That's often the case where... where, in... in order to challenge a governmental action, you... you have to be willing to... to go to court by resisting it.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.301" offset="1012943">That's what the Abbott Laboratories case that we cite in our brief makes quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.500" offset="1029766">And I think last week, just last week, this Court understood precisely that problem in talking about the doctor who faces the abortion statute in Ayotte.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.825" offset="1067069">And several members of the Court pointed out that to risk your license there or to risk, in this case, a job that our client has held for 20 years in order to challenge whether his Fourth Amendment rights are violated is not normally how judicial review should be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.120" offset="1132270">And so the question here really is how judicial review should be accomplished, and we've maintained all along that the way judicial review should be accomplished here is the way that it's accomplished in all sorts of cases, by bringing an action in the Federal district court seeking injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="686.137" offset="2900342">But the two stages at which he has control are to talk to his supervisor and to talk to the facility manager.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.617" offset="3538252">Now, of course, what the Government wants him to do is to exhaust by going back to the FLRA which has already told him that it has no expertise on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.598" offset="3570122">So let me turn to that third stage of the grievance process now, which is now he invokes arbitration, or at least he asks his union to because under section 7121(b)(1)(C)(iii) of the statute, only the union can invoke arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.816" offset="3631039">Now, this Court noted, as long ago as Vaca against Sipes, that unions invoke arbitration in only a minuscule handful of cases, so that in Vaca against Sipes, it was 1 out of 900.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.395" offset="3677328">There was a recent study, the most recent study I could find that was published, about Federal Government employees that were civilian employees of the Army, and it looked at how often did the 31 different unions that represent civilian employees of the Army actually invoke arbitration vis a vis the number of grievances that were filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.299" offset="6448920">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.476" offset="6457697">Although Congress has not clearly expressed an intent to foreclose all judicial review of petitioner's constitutional claim, such review should be conducted in a manner that is as consistent as possible with the text and structure of the CSRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.072" offset="6504091">Because petitioner failed to invoke the grievance procedures of the applicable collective bargaining agreement, his suit was properly dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.792" offset="6530944">And if I may, just in a... a moment or two, summarize the Government's position as to the steps that an individual in petitioner's position would have to take in order to obtain judicial review of a constitutional claim like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.877" offset="6575248">First, the employee must make all reasonable efforts to utilize the available administrative remedies under the CSRA itself, including any applicable collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.297" offset="6616940">So in this instance, the first two steps of the grievance process, talking to the immediate supervisor and then to the facility manager, would have been within petitioner's control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.194" offset="6652571">And if those steps had proven unavailing, petitioner should have requested that the union take the case to arbitration, and then, if necessary, to the FLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.536" offset="6689873">Second, if at the end of the administrative process an avenue of judicial review is available under the CSRA itself, the employee must seek relief pursuant to that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.855" offset="6731147">And I think petitioner really concedes that point to be true; that is, if petitioner were raising a constitutional challenge to a major adverse action, such as dismissal, petitioner concedes not only that he would have been required to exhaust administrative remedies by... by appealing to the Merit Systems Protection Board, but petitioner also concedes that we... he would have had to seek judicial review in the manner specified by the CSRA, that is, by filing a petition for review of the MSPB's decision in the Federal Circuit, rather than proceeding directly to district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.790" offset="6862909">And finally, our position is that if at the conclusion of the administrative process, judicial review is unavailable under the CSRA, the employee may then obtain review of his constitutional challenge alone in district court, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure... Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.918" offset="6927483">Now, in some sense, there is an element of untidiness in our position because what we're trying to do is reconcile Congress' intent to adopt--</text>

            <text syncTime="3246.274" offset="13140864">That is, the dispute here concerns whether, in fact, petitioner was tested more frequently than his colleagues, and if so, what was the explanation?</text>

            <text syncTime="3266.018" offset="13219859">The resolution of those types of questions falls entirely within the expertise of the participants in the grievance process even though constitutional law per se is not what labor arbitrators are best at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.031" offset="13271895">And so, I guess to... to return for a second to... to Justice Scalia's question about why shouldn't the CSRA be read to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.149" offset="13328319">I mean, we certainly think that if... in a sense, that's... that's a debate we would be happy to lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.781" offset="13346918">That is, the Government has not suggested that we have an affirmative interest in preserving judicial review of those claims, and if the Court were looking for a... the simplest solution to the problem, that solution would be... have just as much to recommend it as petitioner's solution, which is that you go straight into Federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.320" offset="13417031">However, we don't think that Congress has spoken with the degree of clarity that this Court's decisions demand to preclude all judicial review of constitutional challenges, and we think the best way of reconciling that presumption of judicial review with the comprehensive nature of the CSRA scheme is to provide that claims... constitutional claims are reviewable if, and only if, the plaintiff has made all reasonable efforts to utilize the available administrative remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3519.026" offset="14231842">And that is that when Congress amended 7121(a) in 1994, they amended it to make clear that it had no effect on judicial causes of action that arose from elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.082" offset="14284087">That's what the insertion of the word administrative there was done.</text>

            <text syncTime="3549.555" offset="14353991">It is not to create an exhaustion regime and certainly not to create an exhaustion regime with what the Government, at least, concedes under the statute, as now written, is not a personnel action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.713" offset="14394637">That is, the CSRA is quite comprehensive with regard to personnel actions, but it leaves to traditional sources of judicial enforcement things that are not personnel actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.644" offset="14442389">And as this Court's opinion in Bush against Lucas makes absolutely clear, a warrantless search of the kind to which our client was subjected is not a personnel action and, therefore, is not within the comprehensive scheme of the CSRA for dealing with personnel actions.</text>
