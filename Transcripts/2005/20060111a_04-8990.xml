            <text syncTime="735.178" offset="3092700">The second matter and one which I think is important is that as a matter of Tennessee law, a circumstantial evidence case requires not only that the prosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, but that it eliminate all reasonable hypotheses of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.912" offset="3167620">So even if a jury could conclude that the blood came during... that the blood got on the jeans during the course of the crime, it would also have to be able... it would also have to be probable that the same jury would also conclude that it was an impossibility for Mr. Blake...

I assume, to begin with, that any reasonable juror would have found this evidence, the evidence of the semen stains, extremely significant because not only did the State argue rape as a... as a motive, possible motive, but there was a specific finding of an aggravated circumstance that the murder occurred in the course of kidnapping and rape.</text>

            <text syncTime="3055.253" offset="12372962">If that juror had heard the DNA evidence, that juror would have said the only positive evidence that a rape was committed here would be evidence that pointed to the husband, not in fact to... to the defendant House.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.913" offset="12451642">And if... if a juror had heard that evidence, it seems to me it is highly unlikely that any reasonable juror would have concluded that that aggravating circumstance was found, and I suppose that would play a... a significant role in... in the ultimate conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.802" offset="12523218">Now, you have argued that the fact that the DNA evidence shows that it was the husband's fluids, not House's, doesn't conclusively prove that House didn't rape her, and of course, you're right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.758" offset="13547009">Very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.868" offset="13567489">Dr. Blake's testimony was not, in fact, discredited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.838" offset="13591313">Counsel for respondent says that... places great significance on... on Dr. Blake's interpretation of the initials inc as standing for incomplete penetration, and that... correctly that should have been construed as inconclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.244" offset="13664978">Counsel fails to acknowledge the record... record 4 of the district court, volume 6, page 906.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.458" offset="13697788">Agent Bigbee himself uses the term inc to mean... or incomplete, just as Dr. Blake did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.866" offset="13735508">So in addition to Dr. Blake saying, yes, I meant the same thing as Justice Breyer observed, Justice Bigbee himself uses the term inc to mean incomplete.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.619" offset="13778454">Page 282 of the joint appendix, he says inconclusive is what the inc stands for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.506" offset="13802068">Dr. Blake testified it is incomplete penetration, which I haven't the foggiest idea what that means.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Kissinger</label>
            <text syncTime="3418.048" offset="13824220">And that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.903" offset="13835610">In trial, he used... he said that inc stands for incomplete, and then Agent Bigbee at trial proceeded to use incomplete and inconclusive interchangeably just as Dr. Blake did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.176" offset="13888691">In addition, when... concerning Dr. Blake's testimony, we have to remember that we still have the missing tube of blood, and the blood on the jeans is more consistent with blood coming from the degraded blood sample than it is from blood which came... got on the jeans during the time of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.243" offset="13964968">The other thing, which I think is an important matter to... to keep in... keep in mind regarding Dr. Blake's testimony and Dr. Bigbee's, is that Dr. Blake and Agent Bigbee both agree on the basic science that blood enzymes deteriorate according the various environmental factors and that as they deteriorate, they become less detectable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.894" offset="14039574">In terms of the... the implicit credibility findings, which respondent relies upon, the district court during its opinion demonstrated that it know... it knew how to make credibility findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.917" offset="14091610">In fact, it made two specific credibility findings in this case when it found Mr. House's testimony to be incredible and the testimony of Lora Muncey to be credible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.470" offset="14121912">As far as the... the suggestion that, yes, there was... the crime scene was wet, that that... that there was water at... or there's a possibility of mud at the crime scene, not only is this contradicted by the absence of the mud... of mud on the victim's clothing, but also the drizzling which counsel described occurred on the day following the murder, not before it happened, not at the time the murder was occurring, but on the day following the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.456" offset="14237791">So, in fact, there was... the murder scene was dry, just as petitioner has informed the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.843" offset="14267362">As far as the daughter not hearing any sign of a struggle, the daughter's testimony was that she did not hear any sign of a struggle when she got up immediately after her mother left the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.878" offset="14327548">The testimony at the evidentiary hearing, unrebutted and unimpeached, was that at that point in time when she was hearing nothing, her mother was, in fact, at the C&amp;C Recreation Center involved in a fight with Hubert Muncey, Jr. In fact, that testimony goes to Mr. House's innocence because at the time she hears nothing, she hears no sign of a struggle, is the very time that the State of Tennessee contended that Mr. House was out murdering Carolyn Muncey, and yet the daughter who was outside of the home within 50 yards of where this murder occurred heard absolutely nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.312" offset="14465265">Justice Scalia asked was there, in fact, other evidence of... of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.282" offset="14493164">Wasn't there, in fact, bruises found on her thighs?</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.387" offset="14501523">On cross examination, the pathologist testified, admitted on cross examination, that the scratches on Ms. Muncey's thighs were more likely attributable to her being dragged through the brush and her body being hidden which, incidentally, is an act which Mr. Muncey confessed to doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.526" offset="14570068">In addition, as I stated before, the evidence has to be viewed in light of the entirety of the evidence of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.206" offset="14620851">It isn't just the blood evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.716" offset="14626806">It isn't just the semen evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.154" offset="14636628">It isn't even just the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.176" offset="14644674">It's also the fact that the same witness who puts Mr. Muncey... or who Mr. House even leaving the Donna Turner home on the night of the murder puts Mr. House leaving the home at a... thank you, Your Honor.</text>
