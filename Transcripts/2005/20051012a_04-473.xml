            <text syncTime="2097.065" offset="8547395">There were tire tracks that did not go the whole length of the driveway, but, rather, tire tracks near the house, where they got the search warrant for.</text>

            <text syncTime="3593.911" offset="14534765">Under our approach, we believe that many cases won't even be filed, because they won't be able to make a colorable claim that it is citizen speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.476" offset="14569037">This case, in its essence, is about whether a public employee has a constitutional right to perform his assigned job duties in such a way that is to the dissatisfaction of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.040" offset="14627238">In Pickering and in Connick, this Court contemplated first amendment litigation in a public employment context in the relatively rare circumstances in which adverse employment action was taken as a result of an employee's extracurricular activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.462" offset="14696933">Under the ninth circuit and the respondent's approach, the exception would become the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.892" offset="14722637">It is our view that the ninth circuit has simply gone too far in giving a broad sweep for first amendment protection for any public employee speech, simply because it happens to be a matter of public concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.309" offset="14772374">As Judge O'Scannlain stated in his special concurring opinion,</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.615" offset="14793586">"The time is right for this court to steer the drifting first amendment jurisprudence back to its proper moorings. "</text>
