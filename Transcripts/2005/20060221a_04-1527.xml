            <text syncTime="245.382" offset="1137828">It's the same water, in a sense, but it's also qualitatively different in its oxygen and other characteristics.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.148" offset="5104887">I can say this, that effectively the States can do precisely that by simply saying,</text>

            <text syncTime="1285.350" offset="5297671">They're sort of the odd man out, because it's their jurisdiction that's being taken away; and yet we're talking about a Clean Water Act case where EPA is the agency defined with that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.185" offset="5333093">FERC has argued to the courts, on several occasions, that 401 needs to be limited to discharge of pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.453" offset="5370082">FERC, at one point, the first several dam proceedings that came up, it didn't even require certifications at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.134" offset="5396832">It then promulgated certification requirements that said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.952" offset="5408117">"Either get a certification or otherwise comply with the law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.861" offset="5419715">And then, in the interim period, it is simply... as we've been affected, simply said, "Go get your certifications".</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.368" offset="5445733">It then tried to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.794" offset="5451480">"But we can do something about it if we don't like them. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.392" offset="5461824">And the Circuit Courts, at least one, has said, "No, you can't".</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.061" offset="5476557">And when 401 applies, as this Court found in Public Utility Districts versus Jefferson, it is a robust power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.629" offset="5510830">It is an awesome power that is given to the States under 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.741" offset="5527235">And to... giving that power greatly cabined in FERC's authority to now extend that power automatically to any conduct that in any way "touches on the water" by turning "touches on the water" or "moving the water" into "discharge into the water"... effectively wipes out that balance entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.359" offset="5605707">I would note, too, that we don't even... we can answer all of this without even getting into those by going back to the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.757" offset="13747343">We are very supportive of the States' approach of reviewing discharges to determine whether or not there has been the creation of pollution, and determining whether or not there is a violation of their water quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.239" offset="13789243">This is a part of... an important role that the State has under the Clean Water Act, that Congress gave to the State, and to which we defend.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.269" offset="13889344">That's... there's nothing unusual about this, because we're talking about the characteristic of the water that might be shared by the water that's upstream and contained in the dam and is also a characteristic of the water below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.919" offset="13931976">Now, under Section 401, the upstream characteristic doesn't matter, because it's... it refers to "any discharge", and it says "into the navigable waters".</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.664" offset="13966980">"Into" is significant, because "any discharge" is "out of something".</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.616" offset="13982758">And so, it can also be "into something".</text>
