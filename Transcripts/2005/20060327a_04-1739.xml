            <text syncTime="1670.116" offset="6827465">First, I find it interesting that and also of some relevance in this case that the decision to deny access to secular newspapers and magazines that this policy of withdrawing access to these materials is not a policy of the Federal Bureau of Prisons with respect to its most maximum security inmates, those who are housed in the control units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.082" offset="6975318">I also think it's important to note that while there's a 90-day minimum period that these inmates have to remain in the Long Term Segregation Unit on level 2 status where this... when this policy applies, the policy also says that as long as an inmate is serving a disciplinary sentence within the prison, that he's not eligible for promotion to level 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.111" offset="7119409">And the testimony from the department's designated witness, Deputy... Superintendent Dickson, acknowledged that most of the inmates in the unit are, indeed, serving disciplinary time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.904" offset="14146557">I would draw your attention to pages 40 and 41 of the joint appendix, which show that... that the unit manager has the authority to set aside disciplinary custody, and an inmate who graduates the Long Term Segregation Unit gets all of their disciplinary custody set aside completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.690" offset="14249688">So in a sense, the... the disciplinary custody aspect is another incentive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3563.823" offset="14402243">The other thing I would point out about the effectiveness of this program, as opposed to the give up on them proposition, is that even at... even in 2002, when the program was only 2 years old, 25 percent of the inmates who had been sent there had graduated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.546" offset="14473192">The statistics on that are at pages 7 and 8 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.100" offset="14495344">Finally, if... if the Court were to affirm the court of appeals, then this case has to be sent back to trial and the burden is put on the prison system to demonstrate empirically that this regulation can achieve its goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.750" offset="14573920">In a sense, I've just demonstrated that it has achieved its goals, but much more importantly, the effect of that would be to totally undermine, if not void, Turner and Overton.</text>
