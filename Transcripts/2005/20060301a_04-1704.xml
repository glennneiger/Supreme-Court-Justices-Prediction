            <text syncTime="223.599" offset="1042785">That... Flast seemed to be a case that fit that description, that there was no one who would have a better claim for injury, in fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.614" offset="1138811">And the Court determined, in that case, that the Establishment Clause was a specific limitation on spending authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.512" offset="1170472">The Court has been very careful, and many Justices of this Court, individually, have said that that distinction in that case will not be extended beyond the Establishment Clause, in the context of spending, in connection with a religious conviction, or the establishment of a religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.985" offset="1244346">The Court has indicated, frequently, I think, that that is not going to be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.705" offset="1267229">At any rate, it wouldn't be extended... the logic of Flast wouldn't be applicable here anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.497" offset="1290426">This is not an application of the spending power by Congress or the taxing power by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.557" offset="1314668">This is the Commerce Clause, which is a permissive grant of authority to Congress, and, at most, under the Dormant Commerce Clause, a limitation on the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="956.866" offset="3975918">But there, in the Flast case, it was a situation where they were using two theories to attack the same legislative enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.465" offset="5530308">A couple of responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.792" offset="5535533">First, to the extent this spurs investment that otherwise would not have taken place anywhere else, of course that's just positive sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.346" offset="5561760">That's new economic development that wouldn't have occurred, but for this incentive, or incentives like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.556" offset="5582658">Of course, at some level there's going to be competition for where these manufacturing facilities are located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.432" offset="5606168">But, again, this Court has noted that competition among the States for their share... or their fair share of interstate commerce is not, in and of itself, a Commerce Clause problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.173" offset="5645143">The question is only when that competition becomes discriminatory in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.632" offset="5666981">And what the Court has meant by "discriminatory" is, Does it somehow tax your decision to be somewhere else?</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.187" offset="5693104">When you decide to be in Missouri, does that increase your Ohio tax bill over what it would otherwise be?</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.063" offset="5716614">Camps Newfound, perfect example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.084" offset="5724764">You decide that you're going to serve an interstate clientele, your tax bill goes up above what it would be if you didn't serve an interstate clientele.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.665" offset="5759037">And Ohio's tax credit doesn't have that characteristic that the Court has found so troubling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.035" offset="5784532">In fact, looking back through the Court's cases, over and over again this notion of burden comes up, and... whereby, "burden", it means</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.672" offset="5815043">"imposing taxes on the business of other State. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.538" offset="5826537">all the way back to Guy versus Baltimore,</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.274" offset="5857466">So, certainly if Ohio were attempting to tax DaimlerChrysler, or treat DaimlerChrysler worse because it had put a plant in Missouri, that would create a Dormant Commerce Clause question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.448" offset="5910233">But here, there's simply nothing like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.052" offset="5920578">In fact, Respondents' theory would dramatically expand this Court's Dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, and would strike down a whole swath of State laws that have engendered substantial investment backed expectation at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.437" offset="5982122">Billions of dollars have been invested by thousands of companies in reliance on various forms of locational credits, whether it be job incentive credits, whether it be investment tax credits, whether it be environmental cleanup credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.861" offset="6035830">All of those credits would be at risk under the theory that Plaintiffs espouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.070" offset="6052653">Your Honors, this Court has more than once noted that the Commerce Clause demands that the States must sink or swim together, but it has never suggested that the States must be indifferent between those two options.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.406" offset="6098001">Frankly, Your Honor, the States would prefer to swim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.094" offset="6108764">ITCs like Ohio's help the States keep their economies afloat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.543" offset="6126527">Respondents disagree with this, as a policy matter, but that debate belongs in Ohio's statehouse, not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.430" offset="6154113">The ITC is not protectionist, and it imposes no burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.406" offset="6174070">And, thus, it does not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1528.571" offset="6262677">Of course, this Court has noted, in various cases, albeit in dicta, that subsidies ordinarily do not run afoul of the Dormant Commerce Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.841" offset="6439788">I'd like to begin with the question of standing, and then turn to the Commerce Clause merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.301" offset="6465597">Let me begin at the point where Petitioners and Respondents agree on the question of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.709" offset="6499242">The original lawsuit brought by Respondents in the Ohio State Court raised two claims, one challenging the investment tax credit that's before this Court today, the other challenging the property tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.937" offset="6568101">The point on which Petitioners and Respondents agree is that Respondents do have standing, in their status as municipal taxpayers, to bring their challenge to the property tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.389" offset="6625988">And, indeed, the District Court agreed and found that there was standing, in the District Court's judgment, to reach both parts of the case on the basis of the Respondents' municipal taxpayer standing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Enrich</label>
            <text syncTime="1662.131" offset="6796934">Justice Ginsburg, there are two reasons why we believe that there is such a basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.935" offset="6824101">First, there are cases... one case in this Court, in Flast v. Cohen, where the Court has found that standing to raise one claim extended, as well, to raise, in that case, a free exercise claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.709" offset="6879272">There are a number of such cases in the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.991" offset="6892333">Wright and Miller has recognized a concept of what they refer to as "ancillary standing" on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.461" offset="6922217">But the second point that we think is perhaps more important is, once there is one claim in the case that satisfies the Article III "case and controversy" requirement, then there is a case or controversy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.434" offset="6990135">The question that then faces this Court is, How far should it reach in addressing the other claims which are part of that very same case or controversy?</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.650" offset="7518958">That's absolutely correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.755" offset="7527422">We would suggest that, in keeping with the consistent holdings of every Circuit Court that has addressed this topic, it would make sense for this Court to acknowledge municipal taxpayer standing, or, at the very least, to acknowledge that the obstacles, any obstacles to municipal taxpayer standing, are prudential obstacles, rather than Article III obstacles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.625" offset="7630867">There are actually other reasons why we believe the Article III barrier is crossed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.533" offset="7666498">We believe that this case... that, as Judge Posner wrote in a recent opinion that we referenced in a letter to the Court... it came out after our brief was filed... in his analysis of the taxpayer standing cases, he concluded that the Court's burden on taxpayer standing was based on prudential, not on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.809" offset="7763673">We believe his analysis is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.831" offset="7775690">Once this becomes a question of the prudential standards, we believe that the very particular factual history of this case provides ample reason for the Court to find that there should be standing in this particular case to reach the investment tax credit claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.507" offset="7858446">Respondents brought this case in the Ohio State Courts largely out of a recognition that the standards for standing were different in the State and Federal Courts in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.932" offset="7912153">In fact, if Petitioners felt that we didn't have standing in Ohio, perhaps the wisest strategy for them would have been to oppose standing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.028" offset="7956561">But, instead, they chose to remove the case to the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.893" offset="7972026">And there, we requested that the case be remanded to the State Courts, because we identified to the District Court the risk, that if the Federal Court kept the case, we might find ourselves, years later, before a higher court that might say, "But you don't have standing", and require us to go back and begin all over in the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.669" offset="8071082">Petitioners, at that time, argued that, in fact, we did have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.139" offset="8096996">And the District Court so held.</text>
