            <text syncTime="11.563" offset="201412">The postal inspectors in this case applied for a warrant to search respondent's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.821" offset="226490">The warrant that they obtained particularly described the place to be searched and the things to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.581" offset="253448">It was issued based on an affidavit that informed the magistrate judge that a videotape containing child pornography that respondent had ordered through the mail and had paid for in cash was going to be delivered to respondent's house and that the warrant would not be executed until the delivery had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.656" offset="341847">The Ninth Circuit held that the execution of this warrant, which occurred after the delivery that the postal inspectors represented would occur had in fact happened, violated the Particularity Clause of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.554" offset="401406">The Ninth Circuit's opinion is wrong because the Particularity Clause of the Fourth Amendment addresses two specific topics, the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.013" offset="455218">It does not address the time of execution of a warrant, which the Ninth Circuit impermissibly read into the Fourth Amendment in violation of its text.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.366" offset="500671">The Ninth Circuit held, therefore, that because the warrant was not in accordance with the Particularity Clause, this search was equivalent to a warrantless search and that all fruits of the search had to be suppressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.059" offset="691365">What would prevent the valid execution of a warrant that had no time limits whatsoever would be the requirement that a warrant must be supported by probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.852" offset="746536">And if agents executed a warrant at a time at which there was no probable cause, for example, because they executed it before the delivery had taken place or they executed it after a time at which probable cause had become stale, the search would be unreasonable and the fruits of the search would probably have to be suppressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.876" offset="902644">I think it absolutely just lasts a reasonable time, Justice Scalia, and the reason why there is very little law and very little litigation on this is that since the 1917 statute that Congress originally wrote to provide for the issuance of Federal search warrants, it's provided for a 10-day execution period, and that 10-day limit has been contained and continued in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.867" offset="6162660">The magistrate found that the warrant, the form of... that constitutes the warrant, incorporated the attached affidavit, and the attached affidavit makes clear exactly what the agent had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.425" offset="6212919">There is an alternative point here that I want to make before I reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, and that is the Ninth Circuit's position, even if the Ninth Circuit were correct that the triggering condition needs to be in the warrant, should still not lead to the suppression of evidence because although the Government's submission is that the triggering condition is not required by the Particularity Clause, if some other doctrine under the Fourth Amendment did require it to be in the warrant, the warrant should be treated as one that is at most overbroad as to the time of permissible execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.882" offset="6354712">That is, on its face it would authorize the warrant to be executed from the moment of issuance until 10 days after issuance instead of from the moment that the triggering condition is satisfied until 10 days after issuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.794" offset="6414376">When courts have confronted overbroad warrants, what they have done is ask is there probable cause that supports part of this warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.743" offset="6454186">If the answer to that is yes, the next question is, is the evidence that's sought to be suppressed acquired under the part of the warrant that was validly supported by probable cause?</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.072" offset="6491489">If the answer to that is yes, there's no suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.034" offset="6507267">The warrant is, in effect, severed and the only suppression that can be obtained is as to evidence that was secured by execution of the part of the warrant that's not supported by probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.626" offset="6549690">Here, there was ample probable cause to support the magistrate judge's conclusion that after the triggering condition was satisfied, the videotape would be on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.444" offset="6588978">The warrant was not executed until after the delivery of the videotape took place, and therefore, there was no deficiency in the correlation between probable cause showings that were made to obtain the warrant and the time at which it was executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.072" offset="6651463">And the result is that there should be no suppression of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.362" offset="6776642">It requires a lot of judgment to be made by the officer in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.950" offset="6786986">There are not only examples in the case law, but I speak from my own experience as a public defender of many years that there are many examples that occur often in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.525" offset="6821259">Specifically a triggering condition may allow for the search of a home after a suspect sells narcotics to an officer, but what will happen is the suspect will take the money from the officer and then have to go to another residence to get the narcotics, not the residence that the magistrate and the officer believe he would get them from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.367" offset="6888655">As a result, he has to make a determination at that point whether the triggering condition has been satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.352" offset="7664596">It's not fair to say that the warrant has been issued and the magistrate provides it to the officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1887.795" offset="7706392">Mr. Reichel, one of the concerns about the position you're taking, the alternative would be that the police officer, expecting that this package is going to be delivered at a certain time, is on the lookout for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.799" offset="7766369">He sees the post officer approaching, calls on his cell phone to get an emergency warrant, let's say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.330" offset="7808479">The magistrate will not be nearly as well informed as he was when he was presented with... was it a 64-paragraph affidavit?</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.908" offset="7862813">So the magistrate knows that the whole deal... he can't possibly know it if he's got... got a telephone call on an urgent basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3455.083" offset="13975466">And if it's buried in some affidavit somewhere, if it's not on the front of the warrant, or if it's vested in the discretion of the officer to make that determination whether that's close enough, then it is prone to these abuses and it is... requires the magistrate to make that final legal determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3591.191" offset="14519963">But the magistrate's probable cause finding is predicated on the view that the items will be there because the Postal Service has represented they'll deliver them.</text>

United States rejected a similar effort to add a requirement to a warrant that would authorize surreptitious entry to install a covert bugging device, and the Court's reasoning in Dalia makes clear that the Court was unwilling to go on a progressive path of reading things into the Fourth Amendment's Particularity Clause that are not there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3665.584" offset="14817550">And alternatively, if the Court believed that it did, that a warrant that's executed after the triggering condition has occurred, does not require suppression of evidence.</text>
