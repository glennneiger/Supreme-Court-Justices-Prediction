            <text syncTime="3484.492" offset="14093102">--hearings, but that $146 million is not just the hearings; it also includes mediation, it includes litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.427" offset="14128837">And there's no basis to conclude that putting the burden on the parents is going to decrease, rather than increase, hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.397" offset="14156736">If you let the school systems slide by without being held accountable, they are likely to be less thorough in preparing their IEPs, as they were in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.797" offset="14198323">And when they're less thorough, there will be more understatement, more disputes, and less consensus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.927" offset="14226849">May I also point out, in response to Justice Breyer's point, if there is to be no Federal law... this question, if it is purely State law... then it ought to be remanded back to the Maryland district court to ascertain what Maryland law is on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.394" offset="14288707">And, Justice O'Connor, while there is no statute or regulation on point, there are certainly background principles of law that Maryland has, just as we've been arguing here at the Federal level, that would dictate for Maryland where that burden of proof should lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.635" offset="14345654">Now, opposing counsel, the Government, has pointed out that there are these pleading requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.206" offset="14375956">But these are not traditional pleading requirements, where one side makes allegations and the other side goes,</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.514" offset="14401242">"admit, admit, deny, deny. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.308" offset="14408348">If you look on page 12 of the addendum, you see the portion of the statute that requires the kind of response the Government must make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.581" offset="14441471">It's not admit/deny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.298" offset="14448367">It is to give, essentially, a detailed explanation for its position, just as the parents have given a detailed explanation for their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.021" offset="14479192">And, between those two positions, you can tell who should have the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.915" offset="14498836">I see my time is up.</text>
