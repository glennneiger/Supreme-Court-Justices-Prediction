            <label>Mr. Samuel H. Heldman</label>
            <text syncTime="6.476" offset="166562">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="10.324" offset="182026">Section 1447(c) provides for fee... for a fee award... allows a fee award when a case is remanded to State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.056" offset="212955">There is, by contrast, no statute providing for a fee award to a defendant who removes, and successfully defends against, a motion to remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.881" offset="248273">There is no statute providing for a fee award against a plaintiff who wrongly invokes the original jurisdiction in Federal District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.267" offset="277739">This indication that there is something peculiarly troublesome and problematic about an incorrect removal is borne out in the case law of this Court and other courts and in the experience, I submit, of every practicing lawyer, that incorrect removals have detrimental effects, both private and systemic, yet Respondents would read section 1447(c) in a way that would leave it essentially without practical effect in the world of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.263" offset="405739">It would give no... it would not effect litigation behavior to any perceptible degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.233" offset="429667">But both the text of the statute, when read in context, and in light of the legal landscape, and the large objectives and equitable considerations at stake here, weigh in favor of a standard that would, as the Seventh Circuit put it, make fee awards the norm in cases of improper removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.394" offset="510229">Turning, first, to the text of the statute, the statute is notable, in that, unlike many fee shifting statutes, it runs only in one direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.584" offset="562996">That is to say, it allows for fees only when the case is remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.283" offset="581804">This is a good textual indicium of remanding, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.075" offset="605001">First of all, it shows that the concern was with the incorrect removals, and the problems they cause in deterring them, rather than a more general concern about mitigation about questions of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.026" offset="660799">That is, a defendant cannot get a fee award even if the plaintiff's motion to remand was not very strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.191" offset="693504">The second thing that the one way nature tells us is that this, the statute, would be practically meaningless if read as the Solicitor General suggests, and as Respondents suggest, in all but a little sliver, to allow fees only when the removal is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.529" offset="778768">If that would not be a precise duplicate of Rule 11, it would at least be close enough to a precise duplicate of Rule 11.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.972" offset="1088580">So, the Solicitor General is correct in saying that there is that logically possible reason for the enactment of the statute, in that there is not a perfect overlay.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.135" offset="1133197">We submit that, in light of the other available textual indicia and the policy reasons, that logically possible hypothesis is not the most reasonable hypothesis.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.768" offset="1283767">--I think the reason why I would disagree with that, respectfully, Your Honor, is, we are not suggesting that it means "shall" in all instances in which a case is remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.176" offset="1321383">The rule we are... or standard we are advocating for deals with that set of cases in which a plaintiff has successfully sought remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.491" offset="1354715">Now, that may constitute most of the cases that are remanded, but there is still the... a separate category of cases, at least one... the case is remanded sua sponte.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.696" offset="1503509">And I guess my question is, Could you give us an example, or examples, of a remand on a party's motion, on a plaintiff's motion, in which the fees would not be allowed?</text>

            <text syncTime="485.840" offset="2084054">Well, the Tenth Circuit, I thought, held that the District Court was within its discretion to deny the award, because, at the time of the removal, the defendants had objectively reasonable grounds to believe that removal was proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.926" offset="4212407">When I say it is not we, but the Congress, that has closed the doors of the Federal Court, I mean on the substantive question of whether the case was removable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.723" offset="4243545">We are dealing here, only by definition, with the cases that were incorrectly removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.766" offset="4263816">So, the real question, I think, when we get down to the policies, is, there is some concern that defendants, under the rule I propose, would have an incentive to remove somewhat fewer cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.623" offset="4319195">They would reserve the questionable removals only for the cases in which they could convince themselves and their clients that the argument was good enough, and the stakes high enough, to justify the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.914" offset="4372381">Now, I submit to you, that's exactly the same sort of situation we have now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.201" offset="4397458">It is merely that, now, when making that cost benefit analysis, the defendant is thinking only of its own fees that it will incur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.609" offset="4435179">But, still, that is a cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.547" offset="4446882">And the Congress, notably, has not seen fit to alleviate that cost at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.080" offset="4465063">So, some questionable removals are already deterred by expense under the rule I propose; some, more would be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.203" offset="6281514">Since the first Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress has given defendants the right to remove cases to Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.751" offset="6311711">Respondents did so properly in this case, and there's no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.033" offset="6328848">The... both lower courts found that we had reasonable grounds for removal, on two bases... based on the only Circuit Court decisions then extant on aggregating punitive damages and attorneys fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.473" offset="6382555">Petitioners conceded that fact here this morning and also in the trial court, District Court, before they moved to remand, a year after removal and after the District Court in the same hearing had indicated its tentative decision to rule against them on the merits of a dismissal motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.312" offset="6469909">So, the issue before the Court today is whether 1447(c) requires a District Court to impose a substantial penalty in the form of attorneys fees on Respondents for what is concededly in this case a reasonable, but ultimately unsuccessful, exercise of their statutory right to remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.760" offset="6559770">And we think the answer to that answer to that question is clearly no, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.776" offset="6575757">The first is that Section 1447(c) is not a fee shifting statute at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.319" offset="6598013">Like its predecessor, Section 5 of the Act of March 3, 1875, Section 1447(c) just confirms the District Court's power to award fees, as well as costs, when it lacks subject matter jurisdiction and, therefore, must remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.979" offset="6676590">There was a prior contrary common law rule, and the Act of March 3, 1875 abrogated it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1890.263" offset="7701739">Furthermore, in the Tenth Circuit, you cannot look to any document, other than the complaint or notice of removal, to establish the facts for removal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2752.113" offset="11149171">I wanted, if I could, to answer one question that Justice Ginsburg asked in the beginning about the Omnibus Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.450" offset="11190549">Justice Ginsburg mentioned that it contained removal friendly provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.409" offset="11214373">And it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.597" offset="11223045">They're not only the two that were mentioned... lack of... or abolition of the verification doctrine and deletion of the removal bond... but much more significant expansions of removal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.048" offset="11280933">The... for us from California, in particular, the 1988 Act said that you could disregard the citizenship of "Doe", or fictitiously named, defendants in deciding whether there was diversity... complete diversity in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.365" offset="11358151">That was huge for us in California, because virtually every State Court complaint in California contains "Doe" defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.095" offset="11389080">And prior to that amendment, their citizen... you had to guess at their citizenship, and it prevented removal of virtually all State Court complaints, on diversity grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.109" offset="11437145">So, to say that this 1988 Act was designed to discourage removals plainly goes against the text of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.778" offset="11479777">Furthermore, removal furthers not only the private interest of the defendant, but the Government's interest, the Federal interest, the interest of the people of the United States, in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.250" offset="11549680">And that's precisely why Congress has given us the right to remove in a whole series of areas, not only in diversity, but, of course, in Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.242" offset="11589700">An interesting example, because it arose for the first time in 1875, in the same Act of March 3, 1875, from which this cost provision comes, an Act that was passed by the lame duck radical Republicans at the same time they passed the Civil Rights Act of 1875, for the purpose of allowing Federal Courts to enforce the new Federal rights that Congress felt were not being adequately addressed in State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.093" offset="11725119">So, the State Courts, particularly the South, were thought to be hostile to the new Federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.219" offset="11745599">Similarly, just this year, in the Class Action Fairness Act, Congress allowed defendants to remove multi State class actions, not for the benefit of the defendants, but for the benefit of the entire Nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2990.092" offset="12101073">Yes, it's true, fees would only be awarded in those cases where the defendant is unsuccessful and the case is remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.334" offset="12138062">But, for example, in the Class Action Fairness Act, that can happen even when there's a perfectly, not just reasonable, but exactly proper ground of removal, because the Class Action Fairness Act, among other things, says that when there's more than one third, and less than two thirds, the citizens in the State in which the complaint was originally filed, they're in the class, then the District Court has discretion to remand the case, even if it's properly brought in Federal Court, removed to Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.445" offset="12278497">So, my general point is that Congress has enacted these removal statutes to promote Federal policy, and that it would be counter to that policy to discourage defendants from removing cases, particularly if the amount of fees that could be awarded would include all the fees incurred in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.942" offset="12404511">I mean, we're talking about very substantial fee awards, in that event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.724" offset="12419558">And they would be a significant deterrent from exercising the very rights that Congress has said defendants should have for the benefit of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.633" offset="12455189">Furthermore, as already pointed out, State Court plaintiffs never enforce congressional policy; otherwise, they'd be in Federal Court, under Federal question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.256" offset="12509733">The defendant has not violated Federal law, so neither of the exceptional circumstances--</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.650" offset="12735326">Mr. Heldman, you have four and a half minutes remaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.365" offset="12750164">First, regarding the continued insinuation of some manipulative intent by the timing of the... of the removal, there was, in this case, no finding by the District Court, no suggestion by the District Court, that there was any such intent, or that that was a reason to deny fees, no suggestion by either of the lower courts to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.042" offset="12844831">Absent that, I think it might be that a delay in removal could, in an appropriate case, be something that went into the calculus of what expenses and fees were incurred as a result of the removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.233" offset="12901674">That may well go into the "amount" question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.937" offset="12912436">But, absent a manipulative intent, it is still the case that it is the plaintiff who successfully sought remand, whenever it happened, that has the cleanest hands in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.745" offset="12947649">Second, Respondents describe their proposal as a middle ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.726" offset="12979623">There is no middle ground in this case, unless it is, "Eh, who knows"?</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.519" offset="13002820">Their proposal is not middle ground, because their proposal says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.957" offset="13016508">"There shall be no award of fees, in general. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.740" offset="13031659">as the most important factor, where there was a reasonable basis for removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.772" offset="13047751">That cannot be described as a middle ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.293" offset="13057886">That tilts it in one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.220" offset="13065618">We tilt it in the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.419" offset="13078366">And, as I say, a middle ground only gets you perhaps to Fogerty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.618" offset="13095189">And it... and, as we show on page 30 of our blue brief, in the footnote, the District... there has been a lot of litigation, after Fogerty, still trying to figure out what the standard is... not only District Court litigation, but appellate litigation, and the Circuits are all over the map as to even what the copyrights standard is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.518" offset="13170735">I urge the Court, for the benefit of the practicing bar, as well as the bench, not to go down that road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.071" offset="13196962">Now, the road made some sense in Fogerty, and multifactor tests makes some sense in the... FOIA and ERISA, because, in those instances, there are very weighty public interests on both sides of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.855" offset="13256103">When an ERISA claimant sues the ERISA fund, it's not a... it's not that one is the particular favorite of the law; they are both favorites--</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.066" offset="13324962">That standard is appropriate, as in Christiansburg, Your Honor, where the party who is potentially subject to the award is the favorite of the law in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.996" offset="13372714">That is, where there is a special reason not to seek to over deter that person, to encourage that person to litigate creatively and aggressively the reasonable, though ultimately wrong, propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.875" offset="13436244">And so, I think the case reduces, in a large sense, to, Does Federal law encourage the creative aggressive litigation of questionable removals?</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.293" offset="13481906">And among the ways we know that it does not is that this Court has said, for 60-something years, that removal is strictly construed, as every Circuit has understood that to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.130" offset="13525269">That means doubts are resolved in favor of remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.984" offset="13536658">If Congress wanted to encourage the removal of questionable cases and get it all hashed out and make the defendants... they would, first of all, abrogate that rule, and, second, they would remove the rule in Section 1447(d) precluding reviews of remand orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.384" offset="13610219">Because as we have it now, except for special cases where the Congress decides otherwise, like the recent Class Action Act, where we have, otherwise, the substantive law is bent towards remand, bent against the creative and aggressive advocacy of perfectly reasonable, but wrong, propositions.</text>
