            <text syncTime="2528.795" offset="10268907">On the facts of this case, there was a pretrial sanction hearing in which the prosecutor showed up unannounced to the defense and actually submitted witnesses and evidence to support the disqualification of Mr. Low.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.972" offset="10313628">So, yes, the prosecutor did play a part and support the disqualification in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.076" offset="10330033">Now, to answer your question on the law and the practicalities, we're here today defending the status quo because the rule in every Federal circuit is that on direct appeal if the right to counsel of choice is denied, it's an automatic reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.064" offset="10385935">So we're... we're relying on the practicalities of how things work in the lower courts only to the extent to say it's working fine just now, and this Court ought not to upset that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.551" offset="10423970">Right now, by our count, you get probably fewer than one case a year in the Federal courts of appeals where a scenario as rare as this arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.086" offset="10458033">And so we think that this Court's incentives, which are put in place by the Wheat case, as I was talking about, get it just right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.100" offset="10490112">They get it so that, yes, there's a little bit of hesitance, but on the other hand, trial judges have substantial discretion in making these threshold decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2615.573" offset="10616022">What the United States is suggesting is that we should have these satellite collateral proceedings where we have to not just investigate questions like that perhaps, but also recreate an entire trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.079" offset="10661997">And this is much more difficult than the Strickland scenario because, as Justice Alito pointed out, in Strickland we can at least compare the defendant... the defendant's lawyer's performance against an objective... an objective counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.007" offset="10713720">And even... and it's even easier than that because, because of the performance prong, the first prong of the Strickland test, we winnow out the decisions that lawyer made to probably just two or three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.504" offset="10751754">I mean, in this Court's typical Strickland case, it looks at one or two decisions a trial judge... the trial counsel made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.879" offset="10777250">In this context, we'd have to look not just at an entire trial, but at the entire attorney client relationship from the moment the... the counsel would have met the defendant, all of the different decisions that might have taken place in terms of investigation, negotiation, strategy before trial, strategy during trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.029" offset="10845795">And what you'd be asking is for this first choice counsel presumably to take the stand or file some sort of affidavit not saying this is the strategy that would have... would have necessarily happened because he didn't get to try the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.107" offset="10902115">What... what you'd be asking this person to do is sort of take the stand and hypothesize what he might have done in all these various situations--</text>

            <text syncTime="2713.694" offset="11008485">But the problem with... you know, to look at the other side, imagine the... the case where the defendant's first choice counsel is disqualified and he does plead guilty and he wants to plead guilty, which, of course, happens in over 90 percent of the criminal cases in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.335" offset="11063029">There, we have an enormous problem because how is that person supposed to show on appeal what would have happened with his first choice lawyer?</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.400" offset="11095316">First of all, under the... under the United States conception, which conflates this... this right with Strickland, they have the problem of this Court's decision in Hill against Lockhart which holds that a defendant doesn't have an ineffective assistance type claim unless he can show that he wouldn't have pleaded guilty at all but for his counsel's advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.582" offset="11168041">And secondly, we have the problem, once again, of just the crazy kind of predictions that we have start to engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.076" offset="11189984">We... I suppose there in a guilty plea case, we have to put the... the first choice lawyer on the stand to testify to all the various things he might have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.160" offset="11222376">Then perhaps we have to put the prosecutor on the stand to say, oh, would you have taken the deal if this would have taken place and that would have taken place and the other would have taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.664" offset="11248394">And... and what we submit is that not only is... is this fundamentally improper because once we have a constitutional violation, the only... the only choices on appeal are Chapman error and structural error, and all of this is outside the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.965" offset="11609615">Once you say that that violates the right, then your only choices, under this Court's jurisprudence... what it said in Neder was the only two choices are structural error or a Chapman review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.242" offset="11650680">The Seventh Circuit, of course, was deciding a habeas case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.007" offset="11733749">The Seventh Circuit way of doing things, which the United States to some degree embraces, of having an evidentiary hearing on collateral review proves the point why we can't say this is subject to harmless error review because we don't have the stuff in the record that we need.</text>

            <text syncTime="3299.970" offset="13353550">Respondent's submission in the Eighth Circuit's holding in this case is fundamentally anomalous in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.794" offset="13380926">The first is that it is anomalous when compared to the other rights that this Court has acknowledged protection of under the Sixth Amendment because it accords to a defendant who had the full opportunity to select his counsel and to select a backup counsel the same remedy as a defendant who had no lawyer at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.337" offset="13455114">And it's anomalous factually because a defendant who is deprived of his first choice counsel may have selected that counsel improvidently, may select his second choice counsel with much greater care, may obtain a lawyer who is far more competent and far more effective, and all of those things have to be discarded on respondent's view and the Eighth Circuit's holding and automatic reversal ordered, forcing society to bear the costs of a retrial even when there is no reasonable probability or it is a beyond a reasonable doubt that no lawyer could have made a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.278" offset="13586876">And the proper accommodation of the values that are at stake in this case is to recognize that some form of prejudice inquiry is appropriate before this Court imposes on the judicial system the extreme consequence of automatic reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.453" offset="13675483">The Seventh Circuit made perfectly clear in the Rodriguez case that it was rejecting on the merits the view that automatic reversal is warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.630" offset="13712263">And the view that automatic reversal is warranted largely arose from a misunderstanding of this Court's Flanagan decision in which dictum was quoted as if it were a holding and because the courts failed to triangulate the right in question here with the right that this Court has recognized in the ineffectiveness context and in the conflicts context.</text>
