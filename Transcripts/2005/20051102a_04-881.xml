            <text syncTime="8.348" offset="167634">Section 207 of the Social Security Act contains a broad ban on the attachment of Social Security benefits that may be overridden if, in doing so, Congress expressly refers to Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.209" offset="223118">Our basic position is that the effect of an express reference to Section 207 can go no further than the authority that is granted in the statute that includes the express reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.165" offset="274945">Therefore, here, the Debt Collection Act, the statute that contains that express reference, prohibits offsets to collect claims that have been outstanding for more than 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.196" offset="327086">Therefore, the Government lacks offset authority to collect Mr. Lockhart's older debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.319" offset="351536">The Debt Collections Act's 10 year bar on the right of the Government to offset debt from governmental payments owing to debtors was enacted in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.698" offset="397094">But, at that time, the Government did not have authority to offset Social Security benefits at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.541" offset="420395">The Government's claim that there's no 10 year bar here relies entirely on a provision of the Higher Education technical amendments that overrode statutes of limitations for collecting student debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.311" offset="475461">But that was passed in 1991, 5 years before the... before... the Government had authority to offset Social Security benefits at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.408" offset="515899">That authority, as I've referred to, came only in 1996, in the Debt Collection Improvement Act, which did expressly refer to the Social Security Act's anti attachment provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.543" offset="9564402">And, like I said, 90 percent of all the student loan defaults are by debtors who are under age 55, and over... about 83 or 84 percent of all Social Security payments are under the retirement system, not the disability system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.162" offset="9622916">And if a person is disabled, there's no reason to think that they can't get a discharge of that loan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2549.253" offset="10346299">I want to address, first, a point that the Government makes, that... and it's about Section 207 of the Social Security Act, the antiattachment provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.356" offset="10403664">Opposing counsel says that it doesn't really matter that the 10 year bar was not addressed in 1996, because all that's necessary under the express reference provision is to refer to the law, in general, that it doesn't apply to limitations periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.943" offset="10501989">But that simply cannot be the case here, because, again, this statute that we are talking about, the Debt Collection Improvement Act, and the Debt Collection Act before, is a bar on the authority of the Government to collect after 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.886" offset="10569802">And let me pick up on the language that Justice Kennedy pointed to from the Debt Collection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.968" offset="10590073">It says, in the very subsection in which Social Security first was put on the radar screen, was first dealt with, (c)(3)(a)(i)... it says that you can now go after Social Security benefits, because they are subject to offset under this section, meaning 3716.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.652" offset="10680875">Then, if you turn to another subsection of that section, it says... and this is the 10 year bar... this section, quote, 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.843" offset="10741584">Now, I don't see any reason to say that 207, the requirement of an express reference, is, sort of, a halfway requirement.</text>
