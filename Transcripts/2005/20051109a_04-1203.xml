            <text syncTime="6.358" offset="184107">General Clement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="7.545" stopTime="113.611">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="7.545" offset="188809">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="11.075" offset="202915">Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act validly abrogates the States' sovereign immunities as applied to the class of cases involving the unconstitutional treatment of disabled inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.271" offset="255787">That result follows from this Court's decisions in Nevada against Hibbs, and Tennessee against Lane.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.394" offset="280238">In Lane, this Court held that it was clear, beyond peradventure, that Congress had an adequate basis to enact prophylactic legislation to ensure that individuals with disabilities had access to public services.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.373" offset="336140">In reaching that conclusion, this Court surveyed a broad array of evidence, not just limited to the court access context, and, indeed, surveyed evidence involving prisons, in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.010" offset="378667">As a result, the sole remaining question, and the only question in Lane on which this Court applied an as applied analysis, is the question of whether or not Title II's remedies are congruent and proportional as applied to the particular context; here, the context of the discriminatory, inhumane, or otherwise unconstitutional treatment of inmates with disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.749" offset="477619">Now, if one applies the congruence and proportionality analysis of Lane, in particular, in the prison context, it easily passes constitutional muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.089" offset="515026">For all of the factors that this Court emphasized as making Title II appropriate in the court access context... the absence of absolute mandates, the inherent flexibility of the reasonable modification standard, the fact that benefits are limited to otherwise eligible individuals, the defenses for fundamental alterations or undue burdens... all of those factors apply with full force in this context.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.611" offset="613142">Can it... with respect to the reasonableness aspect, in Turner versus Safley, we said prison administrators have a good deal of latitude, in the prison context, in order to maintain order.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.275" offset="687748">Now, do you see the reasonableness requirements of the Disabilities Act as being congruent with the Turner Safley reasonableness analysis?</text>

            <text syncTime="145.378" offset="740202">Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.019" offset="746785">And one of the reasons that I think that Title II is particularly congruent and proportional in the prison context is, the reasonable modification standard, which, after all, uses the term "reasonableness", is very well amenable to the kind of Turner deference standard this Court applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.653" offset="809269">And, of course, just last term, this Court, in Johnson against California and Wilkins... and in the Wilkinson case, Cutter against Wilkinson, applied deference to prison officials even in the context of strict scrutiny.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.818" offset="901952">Mr. Chief Justice, I don't... I don't... I'm not up here today saying there's no prophylaxis at all with respect to Title II, but I think it is proportional and congruent, and I think the prophylactic gap between what the Constitution protects and what Title II protects is relatively narrow in the prison context, both because if you think about one set of claims, the Turner claims, much of that deference can be brought in under the reasonable modification standard; and then, if you think of the other class of cases, those involving deliberate indifference, I think in those class of cases, this is... the prison context is one of the rare contexts in which the State is under an affirmative obligation to provide accommodations to the medical needs of inmates, including disabled inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.269" offset="1067777">And I think the fact that here's a case where the Constitution requires affirmative accommodation also helps narrow the prophylactic gap.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.391" offset="1100274">Under Turner, one of the considerations that can be taken into account are the budgetary limitations of State officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.920" offset="1126396">Does that apply under the ADA, as well?</text>

            <text syncTime="245.762" offset="1141756">I think... if you look at the cases that we collect at footnote 17 of our reply brief, which are cases where the lower courts have applied Turner style deference to claims under the Rehabilitation Act or under Title II, I think some of those Courts of Appeals have clearly taken into account those kind of budgetary concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.349" offset="1208107">Of course, all of the concerns you've mentioned could be taken care of by injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.535" offset="1224825">You don't necessarily need damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.269" offset="1231722">Well, I think damages are an important aspect of the remedial scheme, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.423" offset="1252306">I would also point out that, because a number of States have challenged the application of Title II, in the prison context, in particular, as not being valid Commerce Clause legislation, it's not a foregone conclusion that there would be injunctive relief available.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.494" offset="1312597">But I do think if we want to focus on the damage--</text>

            <text syncTime="290.494" offset="1320643">Well, but if we held the Act was applicable for injunctive relief, it would... it would be, because I'm... the pert part of your argument is that you could have a attorneys fees and triple damages where trial attorneys levy against the State treasury, which is... which is what the Eleventh Amendment is largely concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.378" offset="1388143">That... all of that would follow from what you've said so far.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.814" offset="1397965">--Well, I'm not sure about the treble damages, but certainly compensatory damages would be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.095" offset="1414997">This Court, of course, in Barnes against Gorman, has already said that punitive damages are not available under Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.435" offset="1436417">And I think if you look at compensatory damages--</text>

            <text syncTime="322.045" offset="1446866">I know they're not available under Title II, but, I mean, as a constitutional matter, there's certainly nothing barring them, based on what you've told us so far.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.339" offset="1467973">--Well, I think punitive damages would be a harder case, in terms of proportional incongruence.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.947" offset="1490438">But this Court has, even in the absence of congressional action, found damages to be an appropriate remedy for unconstitutional or unlawful State conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.848" offset="1526069">Take the Bivens cases, for example, or the Franklin case, in Title IX, and, I think, if damages are appropriate where Congress hasn't acted, I think where Congress has provided for damages, damages are clearly an appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.796" offset="1573821">But, with respect to damages, in particular, I think it's important to note that the prophylactic gap here is not large, because, in the Title IX context, in the Gebser case, this Court has already said that, in order for there to be compensatory damages, there needs to be a showing of deliberate indifference.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.149" offset="1639232">And now, there may be some difference between what "deliberate indifference" means under Gebser and what "deliberate indifference" means under Farmer against Brennan, but, whatever that small gap is, that certainly seems manageable.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="381.941" offset="1686461">General Clement, in two respects, it... I think you have addressed the cost concern by comparing, in your brief, the Federal experience, which is subject to these controls, and you said it wasn't an inordinate expense, but you also pointed out that every State prison system is subject to the Rehabilitation Act, because they get Federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.756" offset="1825642">Is there a difference between the obligation that State systems would have under the Rehabilitation Act and under the ADA?</text>

            <text syncTime="427.392" offset="1868274">No, Justice Ginsburg, we don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.515" offset="1876737">But one thing I think it's important to emphasize is that, although at the current time period all 50 States take Federal funds for their prisons, so that all 50 States are subject to the Rehabilitation Act, that wasn't true at the time that the ADA was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.322" offset="1935983">And I think what that illustrates is both that Title II plays an important gap filling role and also that, for whatever reason, I think, this is an area... prisons taking Federal funds... where the degree to which they take Federal funds may wax and wane over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.145" offset="1995229">And so, I don't think this is a situation where Title II is purely duplicative of the Rehabilitation Act, but the difference is really in terms of the scope of the coverage, not in terms of the substantive obligations under the--</text>

            <text syncTime="539.300" offset="2315908">And, under that provision, in order to get damages for emotional or mental injury, you have to also show some sort of physical injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.030" offset="2346732">And the lower courts have interpreted that to require at least the kind of more than de minimis injury you need under the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.184" offset="2375363">And I think the PLRA, together with Title II, in the particular area of damages, which is what Justice Kennedy has pointed out is the particular area of concern under the Eleventh Amendment, is even a further narrowing of the relief that's available and a further narrowing of the prophylaxis under the Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.381" offset="2436176">So, I do think the PLRA is actually something that actually helps make sure that the remedy here is congruent and proportional.</text>

            <text syncTime="702.531" offset="2968760">The second reason relates to the record of constitutional violations in this context, a record in the context of State treatment of inmates with disabilities that is extensive, that is judicially documented and confirmed on a nationwide basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.345" offset="5776087">many of the constitutional rights in the prison setting that are significant here don't implicate Turner v. Safley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.266" offset="5795732">Eighth Amendment cruel-and-unusual-punishment claims don't implicate Turner v. Safley, as this Court said in the Johnson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.637" offset="5821227">And we have a very substantial record of Eighth Amendment violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.637" offset="5833243">Of course, the Eighth Amendment requires accommodation of serious medical needs, as this Court has said ever since Estelle v. Gamble, and ADA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.053" offset="5890922">And so, I think another very significant aspect of the congruence and proportionality here is how close the ADA's disability definition is to the class of people who implicate constitutional rights, affirmative constitutional rights of accommodation, under the Eighth Amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.734" offset="5953616">And so, I think that's another very significant aspect of the tightness of the fit here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.483" offset="5972633">But, here, I think the most salient fact is, if you ever had a record justifying prophylaxis nationwide, the record here, that touches on 37 different States, that includes, in many cases, statewide findings of constitutional violations, is it, it's a record that justifies, certainly, some prophylactic legislation; at least... at the very least, the minimal prophylaxis that we have in the ADA in the prison setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.503" offset="6068659">It's a kind of... it's a kind of prophylaxis that's very much like the kind of prophylaxis this Court has previously upheld in Tennessee v. Lane, where we had very similar affirmative constitutional obligations, and in Nevada v. Hibbs, where we had a much less significant record, nationwide, of constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.466" offset="6136577">And so, for all those reasons, you know, we believe that the ADA is congruent and proportional in the prison setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.018" offset="9986713">And it's important to note, I think, that, in that title, Congress did not provide for money-damages remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2743.089" offset="11130980">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.150" offset="11155222">Let me begin by attempting to answer Justice Scalia's questions... question about the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.069" offset="11174971">My understanding is that the key difference between the Rehabilitation Act and Title II is that... is that the Rehabilitation Act requires intentional conduct, which, obviously, is a much... a much higher standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.752" offset="11221678">Instead of dwelling on the record offered in support of Title II... and we agree with Georgia that the record was not sufficient... I'd like to focus on the congruence and proportionality requirements, which are quite separate from the record requirement, and which we believe are independently dispositive in this case, for two separate reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.695" offset="11317495">But, first, I think it's important to recall the two key purposes that the congruence-and-proportionality analysis serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.974" offset="11346543">One of those, as the Court has reiterated, is to prevent Section 5 from becoming a kind of police power through which Congress can regulate the States and impose litigation and other burdens on them as though they were mere corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.608" offset="11409132">The second purpose, of course, is ensuring that the specific remedies that Congress chooses, and especially the abrogation of sovereign immunity... sovereign immunity that this Court has held is within Congress's Section 5 power, are a measured response to Congress's legitimate goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.287" offset="11487813">And that's obviously important, because of the... of the... of the tension between the Section 5 power, on the one hand, and the Eleventh Amendment and other provisions of the Constitution that protect--</text>

            <text syncTime="3060.086" offset="12398964">First, as in Garrett, the substantive accommodation duty imposed by Title II far exceeds the requirements of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.536" offset="12436789">And to see why, we need look no further than Mr. Goodman's complaints that are in the Joint Appendix, the Government's Addendum C, and the Justice Department's implementing regulations, which are found at 28 C.F.R. Section 35.130(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.076" offset="12507007">And if you... if you look at Mr. Goodman's complaint, yes, there are some allegations there that obviously raise constitutional issues, but there are a lot of allegations that clearly state a claim under the Justice Department's interpretation of Title II, but, equally clearly, don't raise constitutional issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.554" offset="12720897">Well, in order to abrogate the State's sovereign immunity, there has to have been a valid exercise of Congress's power, and there has to be a statute that represents a valid exercise of that power; otherwise, there's no basis for subjecting the States to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.734" offset="12793622">So, I don't think it's enough just to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.295" offset="12799892">"Maybe there... maybe there is an Eighth Amendment claim here that's legitimate, and maybe, therefore, in this case, the State's sovereign immunity can be abrogated. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.495" offset="12836672">It has to be done pursuant to a legitimate exercise of Congress's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.494" offset="12852659">Reason number two, Justice Kennedy, is that, as in Boerne and Garrett, even where constitutional issues are implicated, Title II effectively imposes heightened scrutiny on many decisions that are subject to rational-basis review under the Constitution... for example, access to the law library, religious services, associational rights, those sorts of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.171" offset="12939385">And that, I think, is the key distinction between this case and Lane and Hibbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.655" offset="12957253">And so, as the Court put it in Garrett, even with the undue-burden exception, the statute makes unlawful a range of alternative responses that would be reasonable under the Constitution, but would fall short of imposing an undue burden on the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.429" offset="13024336">Number three, as in Garrett, Title II prohibits standards and criteria that have a disparate impact on the disabled, even though that obviously wouldn't be enough to establish a constitutional violation if the disabled were a suspect class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.517" offset="13084731">And, again, the Court need only look at the Justice Department's regulations to see how they impose a disparate-impact requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.560" offset="13120884">And, fourth, again, as in Kimel and Garrett, Title II reverses the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.261" offset="13143663">As the Court held in Garrett, under the Constitution, classifications based on disability are prima facie--</text>

            <text syncTime="3361.482" offset="13604567">Before I say anything else, I want to just clarify that the scope of the Rehab Act and Title II is really coextensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.322" offset="13631944">Mr. Schaerr made a reference to the fact that you need intentional conduct under the Rehab Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.571" offset="13648976">I think that was true for a while in the lower courts with respect to damages claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.130" offset="13667157">I think after this Court's decision in Gebser, in the context of damages claims, the lower courts have generally required deliberate indifference both in the Rehabilitation Act context and in the Title II Act context, to the extent they've reached the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.797" offset="13721805">But with respect to the substantive obligations, they really are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.187" offset="13735389">And I do think that's important, in a couple of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.139" offset="13747196">In particular, I think it's worth remembering here that the damages remedy in Title II... and this is different than Title I, where there was a specific provision for back-pay... but in Title II, the damages remedy is just an incorporation of the damages remedy available under the Rehab Act, which, in turn, incorporates Title VI and Title IX remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.255" offset="13823683">And those, of course, are entirely judge-made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.395" offset="13832251">And so, one of the things this Court recognized in Gebser, in deciding there had to be deliberate indifference for a compensatory-damages claim, is, this Court said, the judge-made nature of those remedies gives the court a particularly free hand in making those remedies make sense, in terms of the statute, and, I would think, a fortiori, in terms of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.904" offset="13910305">So, if--</text>

            <text syncTime="3438.513" offset="13912708">General, when you... earlier, you told us that this doesn't add much to the Constitution, in Turner versus Safley, and then we hear about access to the TV lounge, which doesn't sound like a constitutional deliberate-indifference Eighth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.758" offset="13965684">I mean, if it's important to us how much of this applies, how do we address that issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.973" offset="13990553">--Well, let me address the specter of all these claims for TV access, because I do think that that's something that can be taken care of in any number of respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.345" offset="14020019">One is, a sensible application of Turner-type principles to the reasonable-modification standard can certainly be done in a way to weed out those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.920" offset="14054396">I also think... especially given Justice Kennedy's principal concern with damages, I think here's an area where the PLRA is particularly helpful, because I don't know what kind of physical injury you're going to be able to show to being denied access to the TV room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.742" offset="14117612">And since that's what you need to show under the PLRA in order to recover any damages for mental and emotional suffering that I suppose you could try to bring a claim for emotional suffering for not seeing TV... I'm not sure which way that would cut... but, in any event--</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.533" offset="14172783">--I think, in those contexts, the PLRA is the gateway you need to some physical injury, so I think that's going to help weed these out as a matter of damages claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.655" offset="14209250">And so, I think that's going to have a helpfulness, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.060" offset="14218863">Also, I think, in some... in some sense, you can't lose sight of the fact that perhaps the reason that somebody's being denied access to the TV room is because they're in a wheelchair on the second floor, and the TV room and the law library and the religious services and everything else they need in the prison is on the first floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.740" offset="14281661">And, in those contexts, it may be an appropriate degree of prophylaxis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.630" offset="14297230">But I guess what I would say is, I would think that this Court would want to interpret the PL... # I'm sorry, would want to interpret Title II in a way that avoids constitutional problems, rather than in a way that engenders it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.046" offset="14342892">And so, to the extent the access to the TV room is critical to the constitutionality of the statute, I think the reasonable-modification standard provides plenty of tools to apply Turner-type principles and ameliorate the constitutional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.556" offset="14400884">I mean, if you compared this case with Cutter against Wilkinson from last term, there you had a statutory strict-scrutiny standard that was specifically directed at the prisons in one other context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.724" offset="14445606">And, nonetheless, this Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.240" offset="14451666">"That can be applied with Turner deference-type principles. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.645" offset="14465250">Here, you have a statute that applies broadly, and I would think it would be a very easy act of interpretation and constitutional avoidance to say that,</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.249" offset="14495656">"In the prison context, we're going to interpret in a way that avoids constitutional difficulties. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.561" offset="14516868">If I could try to address just one or two specific questions... Justice Souter, you asked about the practical experience of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.042" offset="14542781">And, as we point out in our opening brief, at page 45, it's been less than 1 percent of our litigation, and less than 2 percent of our compliance cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.071" offset="14574964">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
