            <text syncTime="8.745" offset="195074">Over the last 50 years, courts in virtually every American jurisdiction have suppressed evidence seized inside homes following knock and announce violations... including this Court, on two occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.892" offset="243661">Those suppression orders reflect an understanding of two points key to this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.435" offset="261843">The first point is that the manner of entry... and, in particular, a knock and announce violation... is not somehow independent of the police activity that occurs inside the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.507" offset="306146">And, as this Court directly recognized in Wilson, the reasonableness of police activity inside a home is dependent on the manner of the police entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.328" offset="637483">And that was 1 year after the... this Court's decision in Richards, saying that there is no per se exclusion of drug cases from the knock and announce requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.521" offset="670189">But that brings me to the second reason why courts have almost universally, until the Stevens case in 1999, held that suppression of evidence is necessary, and that is deterrence; because, without the suppression of evidence, there is very little chance that the officers will be deterred from routinely violating the knock and announce requirement, from adopting a sort of personal violation of the requirement, just as--</text>

            <text syncTime="2411.435" offset="9805836">So, questions of causation have not been explored until the Stevens case, and then the Seventh Circuit, in several opinions, has also reached the same conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2507.773" offset="10191194">To not do that, to not have a causation requirement, I believe, severs this Court's current exclusionary rule doctrines from its moorings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2523.199" offset="10252948">You search within proper scope, you're looking for computer monitors, you find them, but, as you're executing, you open a desk drawer and you shut it, you exceed the scope of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.801" offset="10283354">The law is pretty uniform, currently, that you don't suppress the computer monitors because you exceeded the scope by opening the drawer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.917" offset="11075805">We think the important point, though, with regard to the Segura case is that the entry, in Segura, was unlawful both because the officers did not announce and because they did not have a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.663" offset="13178767">First of all, as to the evidence that is causally connected to the knock and announce violation, there are two reasons why the remote possibility of such evidence will never deter police officers from violating the knock and announce requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.930" offset="13227877">The first is that it's very remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.347" offset="13237490">I'm not aware of a single case in American history where there has been identified such evidence that is directly causally related only to the knock and announce violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.664" offset="13270822">But the second reason, more fundamental, is that even if there were such evidence, by definition the possibility of finding such evidence will not deter the police from committing a knock and announce violation, because they wouldn't have found that evidence had they complied with the knock and announce requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.285" offset="13341248">In other words, the police would only gain that evidence by committing the knock and announce violation, so there would be nothing lost in going ahead and risking an excited utterance that they wouldn't be able to use, because, by definition, they wouldn't be getting that excited utterance, anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.888" offset="13399658">I think it's important, with the solicitor general's brief, to rebut the claim that Miller and Sabbath had something to do with the fact that there was no warrant in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.937" offset="13435916">Nothing in Miller and Sabbath turned on the absence of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.829" offset="13451485">And, in fact, in Miller the Court specifically said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.541" offset="13466323">"The requirements stated in Semayne's case still obtains. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.140" offset="13480638">"It applies, as the Government here concedes, whether the arrest is to be made by virtue of a warrant or when officers are authorized to make an arrest for a felony without a warrant. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.618" offset="13518567">The Government conceded, in Miller, that whether there was a warrant or not had nothing to do with the knock and announce violation in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3346.580" offset="13546466">I thought the Government's distinction was based on the fact that they were arrest cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.344" offset="13577500">Perhaps I misread their brief, Justice Scalia, but I thought it was that there was an absence of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.908" offset="13595785">Of course, this is an arrest case, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.246" offset="13605085">The... Mr. Hudson was seized, and was searched, incident to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.648" offset="13622744">And so, this was also an arrest case, much like Miller and Sabbath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.767" offset="13635178">As for the causal connection argument, if this Court were to accept it, I listed, in my principal brief, a litany of cases that I think would have to be overruled... Katz, Knowles, Silverthorne Lumber... for that matter, Kyllo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.163" offset="13696723">All those cases say that it doesn't matter that the Government has a clear, lawful route to get the evidence; the fact that they didn't follow that clear, lawful route prevents the Government from using that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.137" offset="13740713">And it's impossible to explain how Mr. Baughman's causation theory is consonant with all of those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3411.255" offset="13805183">--Mr. Chief Justice, I think the same thing applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.520" offset="13814169">I think that the knock and announce rule is about the sanctity of the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.729" offset="13827021">And this Court could not have said it any more clearly in Wilson, that the reasonableness of a search or seizure inside a home is connected to the method of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.715" offset="13858995">In fact, the Court said it three times, in Wilson, in various ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.004" offset="13872161">And so, I think it is the purpose of the knock and announce rule, is to protect the homeowner's right of privacy against shock, fright, and embarrassment that can come with a precipitous police entry.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3438.407" offset="13913748">But not the general privacy of the home, because you don't dispute that if he had waited an additional 4 seconds, he could have entered the home and executed the warrant.</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Moran</label>
            <text syncTime="3446.220" offset="13944990">No, we don't dispute that at all, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.914" offset="13951782">Finally, I have to ask why this Court has decided all these knock and announce cases in the last 10 years, if my opponents are right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.919" offset="13983756">This Court shouldn't have... they're all criminal cases, and this Court should have simply said the Petitioners or Respondents, as the case may be, cannot obtain the relief they are seeking, because the knock and announce rule is not causally related to the evidence that they're trying to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.041" offset="14040285">And so, if this Court were to adopt my opponent's position, the knock and announce rule will become a dead letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.006" offset="14060138">There will be virtually no cases, there will be virtually no more development of this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.449" offset="14077901">This Court would have been wrong in Miller, it would have been wrong in Sabbath, and it was wrong to reach the substantive constitutional questions it reached in Banks, Richards, Ramirez, and Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.336" offset="14113428">And all the other courts, the... virtually every State currently suppressing evidence seized after a knock and announce... well, they would have to be wrong, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.523" offset="14150208">And so, a lot of courts, including this Court, have been wrong a lot of times, if my opponent is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.718" offset="14171002">Finally, one last word on Segura.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.845" offset="14179465">Segura is the sort of case where one can make a respectable inevitable discovery... in fact, a winning inevitable discovery or independent source argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.206" offset="14208932">But the key thing in Segura is, this Court did not disturb the fact that the evidence that was seized during the initial entry was suppressed, because that was directly connected to the unlawful entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.184" offset="14256892">And so, the evidence that the police initially seized, before the 19-hour wait in Segura, was suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.802" offset="14279358">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
