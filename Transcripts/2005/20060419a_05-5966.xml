            <text syncTime="2872.336" offset="11638031">Arizona has decided to adopt a particular form of the insanity defense, and it has also decided to protect that substantive decision by channeling evidence about a defendant's mental capacity into an affirmative defense with the burden squarely on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.434" offset="11702397">Neither aspect of that judgment violates the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.294" offset="11717861">And I think, with respect to the substantive decision, there are two elements to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.232" offset="11733639">First of all, Arizona wanted to streamline consideration of M'Naghten and focus on the heart of M'Naghten, which is the right/wrong test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.452" offset="11762478">But, equally important, as far back as 1965, in the Schantz case, where they first came up with the rule applied in Mott, they also wanted to not have a diminished capacity defense in the State of Arizona.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.817" offset="12140000">And I think that goes back to the common law, and goes back to Blackstone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.849" offset="12156091">And if you look at Blackstone, and you look at some of the common law cases that this Court cited in its Davis opinion, they describe murder as having several elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.507" offset="12194753">One of them is obviously killing a person, and one is malice aforethought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.398" offset="12206247">And then, some of the cases treat a sound mind as a separate element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.227" offset="12221607">But, I think, if you look at the history, it's clear it wasn't a true element, because the common law put the... it started with a presumption of sanity, which you couldn't have with respect to any other element, and said it was perfectly appropriate to put the burden on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.652" offset="12271344">And I think what the common law recognizes is the question of criminal responsibility or insanity, although it has some logical relationship to mens rea, can be separated out and can be dealt with in an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.795" offset="12323902">And I think if you don't recognize the State's ability to do that, you end up allowing a defendant to basically sneak in, through, as Justice Souter put it, the front door, all sorts of watered down insanity defenses in the guise of arguments trying to negate mens rea.</text>
