            <text syncTime="10.122" offset="180127">The Court of Appeals struck down New Hampshire's parental notification act on its face based upon a potential application of the act that even respondents concede may only arise in the smallest fraction of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.929" offset="231327">In doing so, the act was rendered ineffective in the overwhelming number of applications where it is unquestionably constitutional, and State officials were denied the opportunity to imply... apply and enforce New Hampshire's act within constitutional limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.273" offset="292767">New Hampshire's act can be applied in a manner to protect a minor's health if the rare case arises where a medical emergency occurs that requires an immediate abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.064" offset="335921">In that rare case, if it does arise, where an abortion has to be performed immediately and the child does not want to notify a parent, there is a judicial bypass mechanism available which requires New Hampshire courts to act promptly and without delay and in the best interests of the minor.</text>

            <text syncTime="70.527" offset="421707">Because there is one thing that I'm not sure that I understand about your position, and one way of reading your brief takes you a step beyond what you have just said.</text>

            <text syncTime="81.616" offset="466115">And I understood your argument to be that given the safeguards such as judicial override, there simply was no... there was no need to read the health exception in, that in fact it was taken care of... any of the issues that might be raised in arguing for the need for health exception in fact were addressed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.000" offset="567679">The point at which I'm not clear on your position is... occurs in what you've said on page 11 of your yellow brief, if you could get that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.843" offset="627029">Do you have the carry over paragraph on 11?</text>
            <text syncTime="130.699" offset="662451">You go through the kind of a worst case analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.103" offset="688051">And you say, well, you know, assuming that all of the safeguards somehow do not work, finally, in the unlikely event that a parent refuses to waive the 48-hour waiting period and so on, a doctor who performs an emergency abortion under such circumstances would not be subject to either criminal prosecution or civil liability because his or her conduct would not only be constitutionally protected but would be independently justifiable, and then you cite the competing harms.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.061" offset="843846">What do you mean when you say it would be constitutionally protected?</text>
            <text syncTime="181.382" offset="865162">I read that as suggesting that there was indeed a constitutional requirement for some kind of a health exception, but that may not be what you meant.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.125" offset="1036107">And, if a physician were prosecuted under those circumstances, we believe not only would he have a statutory ability to say this prosecution is inappropriate given our law, but also given those rare circumstances, we do not think that he, under the Constitution, may be prosecuted.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.321" offset="1640894">But if for some reason all of those situations came together and the minor could not seek a judicial bypass in those instances, there is an existing provision of New Hampshire law, our competing harms defense, that we believe protects the physician in those circumstances.</text>
