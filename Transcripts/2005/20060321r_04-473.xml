            <text syncTime="63.468" offset="411189">The fact that the supervisor did not agree with the content of that memorandum should not give the plaintiff a constitutional right to challenge adverse employment decisions that he claims were in response to the product of that memorandum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.524" offset="4359440">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.140" offset="4369889">Much of the work of public employees is performed by speaking or writing, and much of that work concerns matters of public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.768" offset="4404371">Under the Ninth Circuit's decision, public employees engaged in such work have at least a presumptive first amendment right to perform their jobs as they see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.573" offset="4439584">That conclusion rests on a fundamentally mistaken view of the first amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.071" offset="4461631">When the Government pays for somebody to do its work, it has an absolute right to control and direct the manner in which that work is performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.212" offset="4490157">That is a basic rule of agency law, and insofar as Federal employees are concerned, it's a basic rule of our constitutional structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.753" offset="4520354">Article II of the Constitution gives the President the power and responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.243" offset="4546268">Effectuation of that power, and effectuation of the principle of accountability that it embodies, requires that supervisors in the executive branch be able to control and direct the work of their subordinates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.494" offset="4599349">The first amendment, which was adopted just a few years after the Constitution, was not meant to interpose the first amendment in that relationship between supervisor and subordinate or otherwise to regulate the internal affairs of the executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.204" offset="4654101">That is the function of civil service laws adopted by the legislature and internal executive branch directives taking into account the relative costs and benefits of certain types of regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3542.847" offset="14328707">So, if... where... I think Plaintiff's suggesting that, but for protecting speech that's required by the duties of employment, employees really would not have much of a right or a remedy if it turns out that the employer believed that maybe they weren't performing their jobs correctly, or, in our case, if the supervisor had considered the speech and said,</text>

            <text syncTime="3571.884" offset="14444900">"You made a bad judgment call, and we don't think it's entitled to a promotion. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.571" offset="14467574">that shouldn't give the Plaintiff a constitutional right to challenge that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.627" offset="14487845">If that... if the... if Mr. Ceballos was, in fact, doing his job, that was required of his job, and he was doing it competently, his remedy is not the first amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.383" offset="14522849">His remedy is not even... he doesn't even need a whistle blower statute for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.754" offset="14536328">He could go through civil service, he could go through a formal grievance procedure, and though... although State statutes on whistle blowers do vary, there is no State statute, in my understanding, that covers broadly than what the Ninth Circuit does here--</text>

            <text syncTime="3618.346" offset="14630683">--Well, the reason that job required speech may not be... may not be filed, or basis for first amendment retaliation, or the reason why we may not have seen that, may simply be because public employees understandably do not believe they're exercising their first amendment rights when they are simply performing their duties of employment, when they're speaking pursuant to their job duties or writing reports or memorandums pursuant to their job duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.457" offset="14739143">Just because there may not be the significant increase of first amendment litigation in the public employment context for purely job required speech does not mean that this Court should not consider this issue.</text>
