            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="10.972" offset="203395">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="31.524" offset="285524">Respondent alleges in this Bivens action that petitioners, who were postal inspectors, caused him to be prosecuted in retaliation for activity protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.319" offset="332753">In order to make out such a claim, however, respondent must establish that there was no probable cause for the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.012" offset="363473">That is so for three mutually reinforcing reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.834" offset="378833">First, that requirement accords with the deference this Court has consistently held in Armstrong and other cases must be given to the prosecutorial function because that function is core to the executive branch's operations and because prosecutorial decision making is ill suited to judicial second guessing.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.774" offset="458559">Second, that rule accords a... an important objective screen and check against claims of retaliatory prosecution in order to guard against the chilling effect that would otherwise routinely arise from inquiry into the subjective motivations of those involved in the prosecutorial decision making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.863" offset="550928">And third, that rule is deeply rooted in history.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.775" offset="566601">A claim of First Amendment retaliatory prosecution is but one species of a claim of malicious prosecution, and it has long been required that an essential element of a claim of malicious prosecution is that the plaintiff show an absence of probable cause for the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.324" offset="672763">I mean, I... I can see the similarities, but we've also got an entirely separate First Amendment value here which just is not part of the... the analytical mix when you're talking about malicious prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.575" offset="725739">So I'm not sure why we should... we... we should classify it as you argue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="145.958" offset="743293">Well, I... for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.693" offset="750190">First of all, the... the First Amendment... the alleged First Amendment retaliation describes the malice, a form of the malice that would arise in--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="156.117" stopTime="168.334">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="156.117" offset="783940">But it's... it's a peculiar, if you will, a peculiar malice with its own set of constitutional values, and I don't know of anything comparable in... in malicious prosecution generically.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="168.334" stopTime="248.433">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="168.334" offset="832841">--Well, to be sure, what renders it malice or wrongful is the First Amendment, but... but the derivation of... of the reason for why it's wrongful does not, I think, detract from the essential relevance of the tort of malicious prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.898" offset="891042">And if... if I may add to that, the... the reason why the... the tort of malicious prosecution is highly relevant here is not simply because on the malice side of it, but also because it has long been recognized, beginning with Blackstone before the First Amendment and the Constitution were even adopted, that there are critical interests on the other side, not simply the defendant's interests in avoiding badly motivated prosecutions, but the important countervailing public interest of ensuring that wrongdoers are brought to justice and that those who have information about it will come forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.705" offset="1034298">And... and that was recognized by Blackstone early on and has been recognized consistent... consistently by this Court in... in many, many decisions, including recent cases of this Court involving immunity issues, which is what we have here, specifically recognizing that the tort of malicious prosecution is very instructive in deciding how rules should be applied when a Bivens action or a 1983 action is brought in the specific context of prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.618" offset="1309942">Unlike race which is never relevant to the prosecutorial decision making process, there can often be a prosecution... and this case is one of them... in which you might have claims of public corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.289" offset="1364590">And... and in fact, there was a guilty plea here on the part of a member of the Postal Service board of directors for receiving payments to... for his activity on behalf of respondent's corporation and others.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.211" offset="1432299">This was a very, very important procurement by the Post Office Department and it is understandable that in connection with that prosecution, the prosecutors and the Postal Service investigators would look into issues of respondent's, or people in his behalf, approaching the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3466.238" offset="14024365">With all respect, I don't think that that would really work at all because if... if the point is that it would be unconstitutional to bring a prosecution only because of protected First Amendment activity, that could be taken as a given and still be enormous inquiry into what actually happened between the investigator and the prosecutor, what the real motivation was, what the prosecution's policies were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.627" offset="14125929">That is the concern we have for the post hoc inquiry into the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.489" offset="14157380">It's what... what consequences this will have on law enforcement generally if police officers operate under the assumption that if the prosecution fails, they will be subject to civil liability, which is exactly what Blackstone said, as this Court quoted in Dinsman v. Wilkes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.362" offset="14228956">The reason for the rule is that it would be a very great discouragement to public justice if prosecutors, who have a tolerable ground of suspicion, were liable to be sued at law whenever their indictments miscarried.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.930" offset="14335222">The tort of malicious prosecution is what this Court relied upon in Heck v. Humphrey for the favorable termination rule, that you could not bring a 1983 suit unless the conviction had been set aside and the proceeding was terminated in favor of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.178" offset="14400214">That same tort, that tort of malicious prosecution, contains the probable cause requirement to guard against an objective screen, to guard against the very thing that Blackstone was worried about and that this Court noticed in... in the Dinsman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.313" offset="14460714">And that is, that it is important not to have law enforcement officers be chilled from the important function of furnishing information to prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.852" offset="14498853">And this Court's decision in Armstrong imposed an important objective test that you have to show that there's somebody similarly situated before you even inquire into prosecutorial motives.</text>
