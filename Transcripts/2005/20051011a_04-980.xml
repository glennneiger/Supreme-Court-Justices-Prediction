            <text syncTime="18.754" offset="221823">Whether a capital sentencing statute is categorized as "weighing" or "nonweighing" determines how courts assess the impact of an invalid death eligibility factor on a jury's sentence selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.929" offset="274591">To decide whether a statute is "weighing" or "nonweighing", we look to the function, if any, of an eligibility factor in the statute's sentence selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.852" offset="314297">In a "weighing" scheme, as this Court first stated in Zant, a jury is specifically instructed to weigh the statutory eligibility factors, along with any mitigation, to choose the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.090" offset="363198">In a "nonweighing" scheme, the eligibility factors have no role above the role of "all other sentencing evidence".</text>
            <text syncTime="62.029" offset="394963">California is a "nonweighing" State, for two primary reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.592" offset="413248">First, the only reference whatsoever to 11 open ended sentencing factors is in its sentencing factor (a), but that reference has no significance, because, under the language of the statute and the holdings of the California Supreme Court, factor (a) means the jury is to consider, if it's relevant, the facts and circumstances of the offenses, including the facts and circumstances that underlie the eligibility factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.395" offset="1968475">And you might have thought, if factor one turns out to be invalid, the reason that that's a big mistake, because the jury would have weighed something against all that mitigating evidence that it shouldn't have.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.031" offset="2182992">And the jury then weighed one and two and three.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.390" offset="2196367">It didn't have anything to do with the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.424" offset="2204517">Well, if that's the problem, California seems to have that problem, because one of the things it says to weigh is, "Weigh circumstances of the crime".</text>
            <text syncTime="525.769" offset="2249970">And that means that's not everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.504" offset="2256866">That's not the history of this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.301" offset="2268047">And so, the problem that existed in Clemons and in Stringer and in Zant that led to constitutional error seems to be there in California's case, too.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3466.765" offset="14013954">Thank you, Ms. Rivkind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.265" offset="14019910">Ms. Kirkland, you have two and a half minutes left.</text>

            <label>Ms. Jane N. Kirkland</label>
            <text syncTime="3472.202" offset="14035688">I'd like to make three quick points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.329" offset="14068184">The first is that, as to the claim... Ms. Rivkind's claim, that she's reiterated here, that the California Supreme Court has determined that the "special circumstances" label has some independent weight that it's important for the jury to consider at sentencing... she's only cited half of the sentence in Benson and Hamilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.554" offset="14161075">The other half rebuts her claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.398" offset="14172465">The sentence is,</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.007" offset="14174868">"Although we presume that the jurors followed their instructions and considered the invalid special circumstances finding, independent of the underlying facts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.182" offset="14219590">--that's what she relies on... they say, then, as they've said in a number of cases,</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.932" offset="14238607">"we cannot conclude that they could reasonably have given them any independent significant weight. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.669" offset="14269536">So, it's just the point we're making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.263" offset="14275910">It's just a label that does not carry with it any independent significant weight, because the evidence, the argument, the circumstances are all before the jury in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.281" offset="14323975">The second point is that, while there may be some doubt as to whether Mr. Sanders was the actual killer in this case, there's no question as to his complete culpability in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.863" offset="14378310">He was the leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.706" offset="14385728">He led Cebreros there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.863" offset="14390326">He was the one who incited the crime in order to cover up for a prior botched robbery.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3567.333" offset="14416135">Do you agree that such residual doubt factors are appropriately considered if the defendant didn't raise them?</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.741" offset="14457826">I mean, the question of... that, yes, the jury found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but maybe there's something that makes that determination doubtful.</text>

            <text syncTime="3592.370" offset="14516341">I don't think that's an appropriate consideration here, where it wasn't raised, ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.809" offset="14542045">The third point is that we wouldn't be here, except for the overlap in factor... sentencing factor (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.670" offset="14593559">That subclause, which the California Supreme Court has repeatedly held, means only that the jury is to consider all the facts and circumstances of the crime, including the facts and circumstances underlying the special circumstance, or eligibility factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.722" offset="14657715">If that subclause wasn't in there, our eligibility factors in the special circumstance, and our sentencing factors, would be completely mutually exclusive and there would be no issue whatsoever.</text>
