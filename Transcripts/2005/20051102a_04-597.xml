            <text syncTime="200.829" offset="954263">I mean, indeed, the trial court is encouraged to deny that motion, pending the jury verdict, because if the jury comes back, obviously, with a defendant's verdict, that's the end of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.279" offset="5132079">And I think... in a sense, this goes to Justice Kennedy's question... that is, one of the reasons that, at least with respect to the motion that's filed at the conclusion of all the evidence, that these motions are almost uniformly not granted, the case is almost always submitted to the jury, because the thought is, very little is lost by submitting the case to the jury, because the suit has been tried already, and there may be substantial gains in efficiency from pursuing that course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.766" offset="5234061">I think if a motion was made at the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, and the judge thought it clearly had merit and thought that a substantial savings in cost and time would ensue from granting the motion, the trial judge could take that into account in deciding whether the motion should be granted or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.372" offset="5308457">But I think... I think it's important to look at the text of Rule 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.011" offset="5323086">And it's reprinted, among other places, at page 57(a) of the appendix to the certiorari petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.161" offset="5347641">And in... at the beginning of Rule 50(a)(1), it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.466" offset="5380869">"If, during a trial by jury, a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the Court may determine the issue against that party. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.022" offset="5427053">Again, the word "may" is permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.557" offset="5437189">So, while the judge may take into account potential savings in time and expense, the judge is never required to grant a Rule 50(a) motion, even if the judge is firmly persuaded that the evidence on the other side is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.205" offset="5487866">And then, at the very bottom of the page, the first sentence of Rule 50(b) says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.582" offset="5509287">"If, for any reason, the Court does not grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all the evidence, the Court is considered to have submitted the action to the jury, subject to the Court's later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.146" offset="5567592">And the significance of that sentence is that it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.694" offset="5577728">"No matter what stated rationale the District Court gives. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.153" offset="5591625">--whether the District Court simply says, "I'm reserving the motion", or says,</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.341" offset="5644392">And I think one of the reasons that it would be inappropriate to allow appeal of a sufficiency claim without a renewed post verdict motion is that in order attain reversal on appeal, regardless of whether the remedy is entry of judgment or a new trial, the Court of Appeals has to be able to point to an erroneous ruling by the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.903" offset="5782632">Is it not true that if the District judge denies the motion before submitting the case to the jury, within 10 days after the jury verdict, if no further motion is made, he would still... the judge would still have authority to change his mind and grant the motion?</text>

            <text syncTime="1800.158" offset="7351651">Before getting to some of these questions that have been discussed this morning, I think it's helpful to ground ourselves a little bit in the fundamental decision made by the Federal Circuit that is not within this Court's grant of certiorari, and, therefore, is the foundation from which we proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.820" offset="7434302">And, rather succinctly, the Federal Circuit said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.718" offset="7445901">"Unitherm never presented any evidence that could possibly support critical factual elements of its claim. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.363" offset="7480487">"In particular, Unitherm failed to present any facts that could allow a reasonable jury to accept either its proposed market definition or its demonstration of antitrust injury. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.901" offset="7530642">Building on that foundation, Unitherm wants a judgment entered in its favor for $19 million for the injury that they have never proven.</text>
