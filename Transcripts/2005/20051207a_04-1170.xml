            <text syncTime="8.770" offset="182302">The Court has never held that a specific structure for weighing aggravating and mitigating factors is required by the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.024" offset="215321">Yet, this Court has consistently held that all that is required by the Eighth Amendment is for States to afford an opportunity to jurors to consider all mitigating evidence relevant to determination of a sentence other than death.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.551" offset="277492">The Kansas statute, it is undisputed in this case, allowed the respondent to introduce all such evidence and that the jurors, under Kansas law, are specifically instructed to consider all such mitigating evidence on an individualized basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="56.834" offset="374563">The premise of my question is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.869" offset="386684">We... we generally regard mitigation evidence as favoring life, aggravation evidence as favoring death.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.290" offset="412389">We've got a case in which the... the assumption is that they are evenly balanced.</text>

            <text syncTime="83.834" offset="482606">If we are going to demand, as we have said that we're going to demand, that the determination... that the death penalty determination would be one of what we have called reasoned moral judgment, then what has to be supplied in order to make the Kansas provision consistent with reasoned moral justice, it seems to me, is a presumption in favor of death.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.990" offset="931180">And that seems to me another way of saying there is a presumption that if aggravation and mitigation are equal, that the penalty should be death.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.207" offset="1244023">And can... can you go back to Justice Souter's question for a minute?</text>
            <text syncTime="277.742" offset="1258234">Because the way I'm thinking about this, I'm making two assumptions that I'd like you to make, first, that there could be such a case, which I very much doubt, but... but this is a lawyer's hypothetical, this whole thing, in a sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.133" offset="1307762">But I'll make the assumption there could be such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.169" offset="1319882">Second, I will assume that our case law leaves this open, a matter that can be argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.255" offset="1344229">But suppose that we do make that assumption for the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.774" offset="1358335">Then what I'm thinking of is this made up case is the case of the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.178" offset="1383935">We have aggravating factors and break them down into molecules on a scale, and for every molecule of aggravation here, there is a molecule of mitigation there, so that the juror who is very conscientious ends up with the same number of molecules of equal weight on this scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.496" offset="1481215">And in our made up instance, Kansas says, if that's the situation, you must say death.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.815" offset="1514547">Now, if that's the case, how would you reconcile that with a view of the Eighth Amendment that says if you're going to sentence someone to death, there has to be something special about his case that means it's somewhat worse than the ordinary case because, after all, for every molecule of specialness that warranted death, we have a molecule of mitigation that doesn't?</text>
            <text syncTime="377.321" offset="1656549">So that's where I am, trying to get the cases out of it and trying to take very seriously the hypothetical that is before us.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.627" offset="1701793">There are several considerations and steps that must be approached and proven by the State before we get to that actual equation.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.950" offset="1731050">First of all, the State follows the guided discretion standard of this Court, as laid out in Furman and its progeny, to a very narrow definition of what capital murder is.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.138" offset="1767830">In fact, the Kansas death penalty statute is one of the most narrow in the Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.875" offset="1786743">And then past that point to the sentencing jury, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of eight specific aggravating factors exist with jury unanimity.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.350" offset="1836689">And then past that point, Kansas has complied with this Court's requirement under the Eighth Amendment for a juror to consider and give effect to all mitigating evidence relevant to a sentence other than death and that instruction is specifically pointed out in your appendix, pages 23 through 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.812" offset="1914534">Furthermore, the juror is--</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.881" offset="5438766">Furthermore, subsection (3) states that a prosecutor can reserve an issue, but case law is very clear, and that is only if the Kansas Supreme Court sees that issue as important for the administration of justice, the uniform administration of justice, in the State, and has interpreted that to mean only where guidance of the supreme court is necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.515" offset="5645342">And furthermore, it would effectively call into question the laws of five other States that do not even require any weighing mechanism whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.121" offset="5687765">This Court has never gone further and required a specific mechanism of weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances and has relegated that duty, as it should, to the States as long as the juror has the opportunity to make the reasoned moral decision based on the consideration of all mitigating evidence relevant to a decision other than death that relates to the character, the background of the defendant, or the circumstances of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.294" offset="5824438">And if you would look in your joint appendix on pages 25 and 26, you will see the instructions that the State of Kansas gave in this case, and it is undisputed that the respondent's presentation of mitigating evidence was presented to the jury in full, and additionally, the jury was specifically instructed to consider and give weight... I'm sorry.</text>
