            <text syncTime="140.020" offset="709091">And here the Morse case, which we have cited in our briefs, comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.481" offset="722884">In that case, the court held that Samuel Morse was entitled to patent his innovative telegraph but he couldn't go further to effectively patent the law of nature or natural phenomenon associated with it and thereby monopolize all manner of devices and processes that he did not invent and did not enable or describe.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.610" offset="855377">And it seems to me that you, this case was presented as a definiteness case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="183.430" offset="882649">But it was not just definiteness, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.368" offset="894456">It was Section 112.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.632" offset="899472">But let me get to the Morse case because as we have explained in our reply brief and, in fact, in our opening brief, the Morse case was in fact decided under what is now Section 112.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.784" offset="940118">The Court cited and quoted the relevant statute which has not changed in any material respect today.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.149" offset="961539">The Court made clear that the problem in that case, at page 120 of the opinion, was that Morse claims what he has not described in the manner required by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.239" offset="1001976">And what we have here is the same situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.969" offset="1012843">We have these patentees who are indisputably entitled to patent their innovative method for measuring homocysteine.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.729" offset="1039906">And LabCorp continues to use that method sometimes and we pay royalties whenever we use that method.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.001" offset="1068954">But what they couldn't do is what Samuel Morse tried to do and push the envelope, and try to effectively patent the natural phenomenon associated with all homocysteine tests and thereby gain a monopoly over just not the one that they invented, not just those that are in the prior art, which itself would be impermissible, but even yet to be invented assays.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.659" offset="1159651">And here is the nub of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.303" offset="1166234">LabCorp has sought to use but has been penalized for using and is prevented from using a more efficient and cost effective method for assaying homocysteine than the one that these patentees invented.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.150" offset="1217539">The method that LabCorp seeks to use, which is the Abbott method, reduces the processing time for homocysteine tests down from what was up to 18 hours under the patentee's method down to a manner of minutes.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="280.291" offset="1270097">Is the Abbott test... that's patented and you're paying royalties for that?</text>

          <turn speaker="jonathan_s_franklin" startTime="284.033" stopTime="340.492">
            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="284.033" offset="1285144">Actually, I don't know, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.917" offset="1292667">And, I just don't know whether it's patented but it is certainly not covered by their claims 1 through 12, which have never been... well, the district court found that those claims didn't apply here, and that's not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.020" offset="1337075">The Abbott method is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.627" offset="1343449">It's an immunoassay.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.698" offset="1347733">It is not the same kind of mass spectometry gas chromatograph method that they have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.925" offset="1368631">It's much more efficient, it's much more cost effective and the reason obviously that LabCorp wants to use that method is to more effectively serve patients and their doctors and to meet the burgeoning demand for homocysteine tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.798" offset="1424115">But because these patentees have effectively claimed the patent on the natural correlation that's associated with all homocysteine tests, they have prevented LabCorp from using what the patent laws would seek to encourage, that is, a more cost effective, innovative, different method, the kind of thing... exactly the kind of thing that the Court was concerned about in Morse.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.664" offset="8663586">Because for 154 years, it's been clear that you can't take a principle of nature like electricity and simply make a claim for all uses of electricity to create letters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2148.345" offset="8742371">And they thought by referring to the cases and by referring to the failure to point out definitely what the tests were this applied to, it violated 112 because otherwise, it wouldn't be a valid patent, which everyone in the patent field would know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.076" offset="8813320">That's at least, I think, what they're saying.</text>

            <text syncTime="2167.951" offset="8820739">I think it is wrong in the facts and under law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.329" offset="8830247">If it was obvious all along this is an affirmative defense under section 282 of the patent code, that must be pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.249" offset="8857937">One certainly can't be excused for failing to plead something that, dare I say, is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.960" offset="8884791">But let's deal with the Morse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.047" offset="8893150">Mr. Franklin said it's the same statute at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.216" offset="8905793">Actually, that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.780" offset="8912063">At the time Morse was decided, Section 112 and 101 were both together in section 6 of the 1836 patent act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.364" offset="8942469">In 1870, Congress broke that off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.009" offset="8949052">That's important because in Diehr, this Court considered a similar issue with respect to the novelty requirement and concluded that once Congress consciously wrote the novelty requirement out of Section 101, it was inappropriate to inject, you know, the novelty considerations into section 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.959" offset="9016762">The second answer to the Morse question, Justice Breyer, is that the test for definiteness is not is this definite in the abstract, but is it really too broad in relation to the inventive contribution as disclosed in the specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.916" offset="9080605">And the contrast here that is important to keep in mind is between Morse in 1854 and Alexander Graham Bell, claim 5 of that patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.717" offset="9119893">Just to set it up, in the Morse case, claim 8, it had been known for many years that it was possible to transmit using the electromagnetic current but nobody knew how.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.944" offset="9168794">And in fact, this Court's ruling on page 107 says this was known by men of science everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.744" offset="9195962">And the problem was that Morse discovered one particular way to transmit characters at a distance and tried to patent everything that everybody might ever discover using whatever means to print at a distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.301" offset="9246221">Alexander Graham Bell is a good contrast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.979" offset="9256879">Claim 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.690" offset="9259700">It was also known that you could use the electronic current to transmit voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.129" offset="9281539">People had tried and tried and tried and, in fact, there was somebody in Germany who successfully transmitted music but no words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.590" offset="9311318">This is all in... in the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.092" offset="9325320">Now, Graham Bell discovered that the key was to use continuous undulations in current.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.683" offset="9355726">Continuous undulations, not discontinuous undulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.904" offset="9368579">And had a patent claim, claim 5, which was very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.403" offset="9382580">All users of continuous undulations to transmit voice or sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.440" offset="9402747">The Court said that's absolutely right, because he was not trying to claim beyond his inventive contribution to the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.330" offset="9430332">Now, Drs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.202" offset="9433780">Stabler and Allen in this case discovered something very important which is all of the medical tests that existed in the art as late as the 1880s... the 1980s were wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.686" offset="9491668">People were horribly misdiagnosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.414" offset="9502639">And there was a test that existed but nobody used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.563" offset="9515178">This is what the record was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.496" offset="9518939">The test for existing homocysteine was almost never used, as Dr. Allen testified to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.508" offset="9547047">There is evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.832" offset="9552272">This is why we have jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.086" offset="9557287">And what happened was this test was solely for attempting to diagnose inherited enzyme defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.687" offset="9587694">This is rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.470" offset="9590828">Nobody used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.885" offset="9596471">There was not a market for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.756" offset="9600024">As a result of the discovery, the medical community came around and concluded that everything they were doing was wrong and the new test combining the knowledge that it was possible to assay for homocysteine... and by the way, the assaying means only measuring... total homocysteine with the discovery of the correlation could be put together, as Diehr allows, to come up with a better diagnostic test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.504" offset="9702946">And at the time, obviously, and this is, again, in the trial testimony, no market for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.373" offset="9726456">Nobody wanted to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.494" offset="9730949">Everybody was just delighted with the existing tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.035" offset="9745160">And so Dr. Allen and Dr. Stabler had to set up their own lab to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.617" offset="9759475">It was after the medical community came around that all of the lab companies became interested in doing this commercially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.597" offset="9787374">And I go into this level of detail because I think it is in part needed to answer the point made by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.869" offset="9816422">In a world in which there was no commercial use for the existing prior art because it was used rarely, and a market develops solely as a result of people using the test to practice the invention, I think it's analytically incorrect to say that we're trying to monopolize the existing prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.281" offset="9898133">What has happened is commercial laboratory companies like LabCorp are selling the test to practice our invention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.854" offset="10732379">Three answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.278" offset="10738126">Number one, under the patent laws, everybody... anybody who makes, uses or sells the invention is potentially liable as an infringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.223" offset="10769891">Number two, Congress knows this and it knows that the people who might be liable as infringers are doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.873" offset="10796432">It passed in 1996 section 287 C of the patent law that gives doctors a defense to infringement for certain things they do in their offices, not this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.145" offset="10841571">So Congress is perfectly aware of all of the policy issues being raised and has chosen to give an answer only so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.520" offset="10875008">The third is it is a fundamental misconception to treat the case as though, even if the Section 101 issue is in front of the Court... and it isn't... whether the issue is whether Section 101 means that something is actually patentable as opposed to what Diehr said, which is, is it possibly patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.271" offset="10954107">This is subject matter patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.306" offset="10962153">Is the mouth of the funnel, not the end of the funnel, and all of the outlandish hypotheticals that we have to deal about how this could be patented don't really deal with the reality of the patent code, which is this is the intake funnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.305" offset="11014188">We have doctrines of obviousness, anticipation, 112, many other things, all of which were raised at trial and the jury rejected in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.784" offset="11052118">But the reason why there may be some superficial appeal to the outlandish hypotheticals, Justice Breyer, is because there is an effort to confuse the issue that they're trying to smuggle belatedly into the case, 101, as though it dealt with whether something is actually patentable as opposed to potentially patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.088" offset="11125366">And on the latter question, whether something is potentially patentable, we have the extremely broad language of Section 101 coupled by this Court's cases, in Chakrabarty and Diehr, which said that what Congress intended is for anything under the sun made by man to be potentially patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.291" offset="11194120">And if there is some more precise policy issue why a particular invention ought not to be patentable, it is found in section 102, 103, 112, other parts of the patent code, on which they lost in front of the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2866.716" offset="11615841">Number one, it was very clear to the Federal Circuit, and in fact I think they said that, I can't put my hand on the page, where they said, there is no issue here about step number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.381" offset="11650531">All that people are fighting about is the correlating step and what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.473" offset="11666832">And the problem that LabCorp had in the Federal Circuit with respect to the correlating step, which is a question they tried to bring up and was cert denied, is that they proposed in the district court the definition that was used by the Federal Circuit, which is a mutual or reciprocal relationship between an elevated level and the vitamin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.002" offset="11744990">And so having proposed that, it actually makes sense as a diagnostic test, as the Federal Circuit pointed out with the example of the pregnancy test.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.287" offset="12410172">But let me point something else, Justice Breyer, which is it came from a committee report that has already been incorporated in this Court's cases in Chakrabarty and in Diehr as exemplary of Congress' determination to have the mouth of the funnel be very wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.345" offset="12470358">And if there are problems with something being ultimately patentable, they are because there is some other requirement of the patent law that... that... that should be looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.731" offset="12507870">One of the other points on the question that Justice Scalia asked, because I think it is important on whether this question is before the Court, is that the rules of this Court, rule 14-1-F mandated that the petition shall contain, quote, the status involved in the case set out verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.847" offset="12580386">And you can pick up the cert petition and indeed there is an appendix which is at the very last page of the petition, and you can look at it and it says, pertinent statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.706" offset="12619779">There are two statutes, Section 112 and section 271.</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.188" offset="12781738">But it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.991" offset="12784977">Let me just go back and link that point with another aspect of our legal system, which is you see cases of forfeiture and waiver all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.344" offset="12830326">This term in Unitherm and in Arbaugh, you have already said twice that parties should be held responsible for their procedural defaults.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.388" offset="12862508">You do that in other areas of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.623" offset="12871495">And the one that came to mind, to my mind as I was thinking about this case, Justice Stevens, is going all the way back to Wainwright versus Sykes, because you have cases every year involving habeas corpus, where Wainwright versus Sykes says we have to be careful about sandbagging, and we're going to presume that an indigent defendant on trial for his life in a rural county someplace with a lawyer two years out of law school, who can't find the courthouse, consciously chose to save the federal claims so that he could assert later, have it in his back pocket: We're going to have a rule of forfeiture for sandbagging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.130" offset="13025513">Empirically, one may well wonder whether that is empirically likely to be true in a great number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.766" offset="13048082">But we don't have to wonder in this case because every well advised corporate defendant, if I am their lawyer, I will advise them to hold this in the back pocket and to have a second trip to the trial court and the court of appeals because in the rules in affirmative defense, rule 8 says you have to plead it and the statute says you have to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.109" offset="13117359">And it went all the way up the ladder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.248" offset="13130002">And if you tell them that they get to start all over again, what you will have is every well advised corporate defendant will be advised by counsel, like me and by Mr. Franklin, that the way to do is to tire the inventor out, have a trial and then we can start all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.556" offset="13195204">And that's no way to run a legal system, especially when they're coming with the most important questions of patent law to this Court with incredibly far reaching implications and the best that they can say to the Court about why you shouldn't worry about the consequences is, as they say in the closing pages of the reply brief, rule for us and every other case will have to be considered on its own merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.767" offset="13287991">Which I guess is true as far as it goes but it's about as helpful as telling the Patent Office and the lower courts that life is a fountain.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.417" offset="13502613">And so my basic point, Justice Stevens, is if that the legal system takes the procedural regularity of our courts seriously enough to enforce them in what would seem to some people to be pretty compelling circumstances of life and death, there is little claim on the legal system for a well heeled corporate defendant who has been adjudged to be a willful infringer by a jury to come to this Court and asked to be put in the starting gate again.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.965" offset="13968846">I don't want to take up your time on rebuttal but I have to ask you, do you have an explanation for not quoting section 101 in your papers?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="3462.849" offset="14000402">I think the explanation is that we cited all of the cases... for example, Mackay Radio is a case we cited that doesn't itself cite 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.157" offset="14037601">The Court itself never cited 101 in these cases until 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.700" offset="14055782">It was a judicially created exception for laws of nature and natural phenomena.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.646" offset="14075530">And of course to the extent it is applicable here, it is applicable either on its own, but also in connection with and as a natural predicate to the 112 inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.461" offset="14110848">And there I think the analogy to Morse is quite striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.269" offset="14122028">And what... in Morse, the Court said that he could not monopolize all devices and processes used to transmit the characters at a distance through the natural phenomenon of electromagnetism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.595" offset="14171348">Here what these patent cases are seeking to do is to monopolize all homocysteine tests that are used to, as they say, detect vitamin deficiencies through the natural correlation that they recite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.819" offset="14216278">Morse couldn't do that because it wasn't limited to the one device that he actually invented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.785" offset="14236131">Here they cannot do it because it's not limited to the one homocysteine assay that they in fact invented, that we use and that we pay royalties on every time we use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.193" offset="14273748">Finally, I think that the primary gatekeepers here on these kinds of things is the Patent &amp; Trademark Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.594" offset="14303318">I think they're trying their best, but what I heard from their representative today is that they're not prepared to do anything about these kinds of patents unless this Court gives them further guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.688" offset="14347726">We are only asking that the Court give them further guidance on this patent and to say that a patent that claims nothing more than a natural correlation preceded by the inherent and generic step of measuring the input for that correlation is invalid and the judgment that is based upon it should also be reversed.</text>
