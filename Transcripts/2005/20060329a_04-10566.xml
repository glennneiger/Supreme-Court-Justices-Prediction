            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="182374">We'll hear argument first this morning in two cases, Sanchez Llamas v. Oregon and Bustillo v. Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.803" offset="209541">Mr. Gartlan.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Gartlan</label>
            <text syncTime="8.147" offset="214870">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="12.929" offset="233992">This case presents three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.273" offset="243396">The first is does article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations confer rights to individuals such as Mr. Sanchez Llamas.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.681" offset="277042">The second is can Mr. Sanchez Llamas enforce the right in a State criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.390" offset="299925">And the third is can the right be enforced by suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.662" offset="312986">The first issue is... is a matter of treaty interpretation, and the language of the article 36 is... is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.060" offset="342557">It confers three rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.498" offset="352274">Article 36(1) says that the consulate and the individual can have free communication between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.562" offset="384562">Article 36(1)(b) gives to the detainee, the foreign national detainee, the right to have his consulate notified of his arrest and the right to forward communication to the consulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.003" offset="442345">And it also imposes a duty on the detaining authorities to inform the foreign national under... of his rights under that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.827" offset="477662">And it's critical, or at least important, and telling to... to notice that the detainee gets to control the communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.163" offset="518936">The detainee initiates and controls the communication with the consulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.361" offset="539729">It's not the consulate contacting the detainee initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.987" offset="558224">It's the detainee authorizes the contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.426" offset="568046">The secondary sources... we... we believe the text is plain, but if the Court resorts to any secondary sources, that too will confirm the plain language of... of the article.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="108.262" offset="615380">I thought that the argument on the other side is that those references in the secondary sources and in the document itself are meant to make clear that if the individual detainee does not want contact with his consular officials, for example, in a case where he might be seeking asylum or something like that, that it was, as you said earlier, his decision and not necessarily that there was to be a departure from the norm in international... the international context where treaties are between the sovereigns and don't confer enforceable rights on individuals.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Gartlan</label>
            <text syncTime="144.728" offset="761247">Well, Your Honor, actually the article 36 is... is unique and different in that the revolutionary part of this is that the detainee did, for the first time, have the authority to have the consulate notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.335" offset="819657">Typically most of the notification statutes, bilateral treaties, multilateral treaties require mandatory notification, but this is an instance where the detainee gets to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.432" offset="864065">The detainee decides whether or not the consulate is going to be contacted.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.214" offset="879216">So the... that's what the different countries, the signatories, are supposed to provide, and if they don't, that's a matter to be taken up bilaterally between the countries involved and not necessarily an individual enforceable right.</text>

            <text syncTime="192.353" offset="951732">You know, a state could complain to another state, but the question here is whether or not this article, as domestic law in the United States, confers a personal right to a foreign national detainee because a treaty in the United States, a self executing treaty... and everybody agrees this is that... works in two spheres, on two levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.858" offset="1037727">One level is the international level, but by... through the Supremacy Clause, the treaty is also domestic law.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.922" offset="1070015">And the question is whether as domestic law this treaty confers personal rights to individuals because--</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.452" offset="5764114">Mario... Mario Bustillo was not advised of his rights under article 36 in direct contravention of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.006" offset="5790341">As a result, he went to trial for first degree murder, having had no contact with a consular officer from his home country and being completely unaware that he was entitled to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.814" offset="5829630">The Virginia courts improperly relied upon the result of that violation, itself the product of failure to comply with the treaty, to refuse to consider critical exculpatory evidence that was uniquely in the possession and available with the assistance of the consular officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.609" offset="5892741">That evidence would have included official government immigration records, corroborating a key defense witness, and proving that the alternative suspect, a Honduran national, known as Sirena, fled to Honduras the day after the victim died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.122" offset="5942792">The Honduran consulate also would have provided Sirena's address and attempted to interview him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.832" offset="5961600">Indeed, once Bustillo's habeas counsel located Sirena in Honduras, he obtained a surreptitiously videotaped confession in which Sirena admitted, in chilling detail, to committing the crime and acknowledged that Mario Bustillo had been wrongly convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.817" offset="11185567">And one thing that the preamble makes very clear is that matters not expressly regulated by the provisions of this treaty are left to the rules of customary international law.</text>

Federal treaty rights as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="3776.715" offset="15289195">Now, that may or may not be ineffective assistance of counsel, but it does not justify setting aside the State's procedural bars on collateral review, which would apply for a Miranda violation or a Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.539" offset="15344470">I would also note, Your Honor, that the United States is unique in the world in having the extensive system of collateral review for criminal convictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4954.970" offset="20002207">I'd like to first briefly address two points on behalf of Mr. Sanchez Llamas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.838" offset="20017672">First, with... with respect to him, the question is how to give full effect to the treaty in the context of custodial interrogation, and his position is that suppression is necessary to give full effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.860" offset="20057796">And we need look no further than the fact that the custodial... that the remedies that are currently afforded in a context of custodial interrogation are ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4977.716" offset="20093218">And secondly, admitting evidence encourages violations, and that'sl been the... the result that's been a constant pattern and practice of violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.553" offset="20120490">If I could switch back to Mr. Bustillo's case, and I'd like to address what Mr. Garre just said, which is that there's a presumption or that... that treaties don't create individually enforceable rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.742" offset="20161241">Every decision of this Court is unambiguously clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.194" offset="20175138">Where you have a treaty that becomes part of the domestic law... here it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.015" offset="20194364">Where that treaty creates rights... here the treaty says his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.716" offset="20209202">And third and critically, where you have a cause of action to enforce those rights, it is judicially enforceable as a matter of domestic law.</text>

            <text syncTime="5146.657" offset="20768954">That's because trial counsel doesn't have unique experience and knowledge necessary to make these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.811" offset="20797584">That's why the treaty expressly puts it in the hands of the foreign national to make these decisions, not the lawyer.</text>
