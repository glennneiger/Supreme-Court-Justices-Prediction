            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="6.401" offset="178844">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="9.251" offset="190233">The fundamental question that's posed in this particular case is whether or not the court of appeals by adopting a rule that declares categorically that three out of the four traditional factors for deciding whether or not to grant permanent injunctive relief will be irrebuttably presumed to be satisfied whenever a jury has found that a patent is valid and has been infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.134" offset="285737">The rule in the Federal Circuit for at least 20 years has been that if you have validity and infringement decided by the jury, that then there is irrebuttable finding of... of irreparable injury, of inadequate remedy at law, and that the balance of harms decidedly favors the plaintiff, and that the only issue that remains available to the defendant in that circumstance is a heightened scrutiny on the standard of whether or not the... the public interest commands that an injunction be denied in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.238" offset="410184">And even in that context, the Federal Circuit's rule is extraordinarily stringent because not just any public interest can... will satisfy, but instead, it has to be a public interest that endangers the public health.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="76.646" offset="459817">Is that all in Judge Bryson's decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="80.181" offset="473923">I certainly didn't see it there.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="82.231" offset="482073">That... that is precise... I think it's the only way to read Judge Bryson's decision, Justice Ginsburg, where the court says, at page 26a, that a permanent injunction will issue once infringement and validity have been adjudged, and then say, to be sure, it will not be so to protect the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.627" offset="555739">And we all know the traditional rule with respect to the grant of injunctive relief is that it's a four factor test.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="106.165" offset="577891">I didn't see anything about irrebuttable presumption.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="108.731" offset="588131">Well, the point is that if an injunction follows with a finding of... of validity and infringement, then that means that there has to be... there has to be irreparable injury, inadequate remedy at law, and that the balance of hardships has to tilt in... in favor of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.460" offset="651033">And then the only issue that remains is whether or not the public interest justifies not granting an injunction under the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.630" offset="683739">It seems to me there's no other way to read that.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.566" offset="691471">And if you read it in the context of the... of the previous 20 years of decisions from the Federal Circuit, it is absolutely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.386" offset="714772">We don't have the opportunity to come back as a defendant in an infringement action and say, Your Honor, in the specific facts of this case, this is someone for whom money damages is a completely adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.860" offset="764614">And... and it seems to me quite clear that section 283 is designed to be exactly the opposite of the way the Federal Circuit has interpreted this... this scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.501" offset="807246">Section 283 says explicitly... and this is at page 1 of the blue brief... district courts, quote, may... not shall... grant injunctions in accordance with principles of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.441" offset="846952">And principles of equity, as Justice Story said almost 200 years ago, systematically reject the idea that you will act on a categorical basis in deciding whether or not to grant or withdraw the injunctive relief in... in particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.402" offset="914766">And to the contrary, you have to look at each specific issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.020" offset="925319">And in that regard--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="193.820" stopTime="237.983">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="193.820" offset="928454">Is... is that so with... with respect to someone else's use of... of your property?</text>
            <text syncTime="202.893" offset="964816">It seems to me very rare where... where someone takes your property, that the court wouldn't... wouldn't give you the property back and... and simply say, you know... I can think of a few extraordinary examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.803" offset="1020405">If somebody makes a statue out of stolen gold, you know, the... the old classic, I guess you'd get the money back.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.076" offset="1053528">But ordinarily we're talking about a property right here, and... and the property right is... is explicitly the right to exclude others from... from use of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.181" offset="1089891">That's what the patent right is.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.714" offset="1096055">And all he's asking for is give me my property back.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="237.983" stopTime="303.342">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="237.983" offset="1105146">--Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.366" offset="1106609">And... and Congress already made the... the balance, Justice Scalia, with respect to that because Congress obviously identified the property right as the right to exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.405" offset="1138792">And then Congress did not confer upon the district courts no discretion to act in... in a situation where the property right has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.178" offset="1173900">Instead, Congress expressly adopts in 283 a very broad grant of equitable discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.999" offset="1197202">To be sure, in the ordinary case, you... you very well may have irreparable injury proved, but the question is, do you... do you eliminate any inquiry and any specific facts of the case and instead not only presume it, which I think is a mistake, although the district court did that and found that in this case the presumption was rebutted, but to... but to say irrebuttably it's presumed that you have irreparable injury, irrebuttably presumed that you don't have an adequate remedy at law, and irrebuttably presume that the balance of equities tilt in favor of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.851" offset="1320604">And that, it seems to me, cannot be squared with the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.236" offset="1334188">And, indeed, on that score, the United States sort of magically ends up on our side of the... of the table because the United States says the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.076" offset="1361460">There is no way--</text>

            <text syncTime="303.342" offset="1366580">On Justice Scalia's question, I was trying to think of some, and I was trying to think the analogy might... you might find some analogy in the public utilities field, the... or a ferris wheel or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.050" offset="1413391">What you want is a person who uses his property not at all himself, but licensed the public generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.704" offset="1440036">And now would a... would a court issue an injunction there?</text>
            <text syncTime="329.493" offset="1471174">And as I think about that, I don't realize I don't know the answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.720" offset="1564065">Well, I don't know that there are a whole lot of them like that, but the one thing that... I mean, there are two things to think about the property concept in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.158" offset="1589874">First of all, Congress does not declare that the property interest here is a real property interest, which traditionally has been protected differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.395" offset="1618818">It's a personal property interest, which is traditionally given... accorded less protection under this kind of a scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.482" offset="1647135">And so there... and... and again, Congress in any event struck the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.184" offset="1665943">It didn't say, as it could have, that there is presumed... there's a presumption that we have an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.771" offset="1688304">It didn't say, as it could have, that we shall have a... shall have either a presumption or an injunction in any particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.694" offset="1723935">Well, but... but the exercise of discretion is channeled over time, as... as judges apply it in... in similar cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.564" offset="1755491">You're not suggesting that in a typical run of the mine patent case, no special considerations, it would be wrong to say that in those cases you typically would grant an injunction?</text>

            <text syncTime="412.239" offset="1802197">--I think in those cases, the irreparable injury and the inadequacy of the remedy at law will be... will be easy to demonstrate, as they have been for hundreds of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.213" offset="1842008">The... the fundamental difference... this is important to have this in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.748" offset="1856219">The Federal Circuit adopted this rule of law some 20 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.283" offset="1870325">That's before the high tech boom, before the explosion in the number of patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.585" offset="1891536">And so the opportunity to deal with these issues on an individualized basis that might give rise to some kinds of rules that you could, in fact, apply to the generality of cases based on an experience has never been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.661" offset="1943886">We have been dealing with an irrebuttable presumption for 20 years in a way that has... has completely stultified the ability to develop any of those kinds of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.481" offset="1975128">And what we're asking this Court to do at this point is to say, no, enough is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.552" offset="1995399">We need to go back to a time where the... go back to the language of the statute, confer the discretion on the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.456" offset="2019014">And it's important not just for a case like this one, but it... but it distorts tremendously the settlement value and the process and the relationship between the patent holder and all of the potential licensees because we're in a... in a world... and I don't think the Court can ignore this because it's in the amicus briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.649" offset="2079827">We're in a world where if a patent holder files a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas, no patent has ever been declared invalid in that jurisdiction, and no patent has never been found not to infringe.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.856" offset="2120578">And then you take that finding automatically and you turn it into an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.808" offset="2136460">Any person who has been threatened under those circumstances and told that we're going to face a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas is going to have a very different negotiating posture than in a situation where--</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.866" offset="4400650">The... the additional point that I think it's important I at least spend a minute on, because the Court asked for us to deal with Continental Paper Bag, is that it does seem to me quite clear that, at least at this stage, the parties are pretty much in sync, that... that the Court need not revisit Continental Paper Bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.876" offset="4460731">The holding in that case is actually almost a sort of quintessential situation where you have two participants in the market, one of whom would like to take advantage of a patent that will improve that participant's ability to produce a product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.517" offset="4511304">The patent holder is not ready yet to develop that product using that particular method and, therefore, sues to stop his competitor from entering into that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.440" offset="4550906">I mean, that's the classic kind of situation where you have a... you know, where you... where you've got the potential infringer is looking at what's going on and making a decision and copying it and then trying to implement it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.680" offset="4595941">And the Court said, under those circumstances, you get an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.632" offset="4607748">But here, of course, we're dealing with a vastly different situation, as we... as we point out that... in our brief, where the... at page 9 where the district court specifically found that not any of eBay's success is attributable to anything in the patents of the plaintiff in this case and that nothing in the patents that were put forward by the plaintiff in this case provide any basis on which anyone could build a business model.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.782" offset="4712343">So this is, to my mind, the antithesis of the situation in Continental Paper Bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.770" offset="4732300">But in any event, the holding there is clearly not implicated here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1151.174" offset="4757900">To the extent that there is... is dicta in there that talks about the right to exclude, Justice Scalia, I think, in general, the right to exclude is one that you do, in fact, enforce with injunctive relief in many cases, but the question here is whether or not the Federal Circuit should have adopted a rule that says you... you enforce it in every case irrebuttably as to three of the four factors, and as to the fourth factor, you don't go any further than requiring the plaintiff to show that there's a... an imminent public health crisis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.007" offset="6045215">The United States submits that the right to a patent is an important matter, but it must be considered in the context of the remedies as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.780" offset="6084294">And the United States further submits the patentee's right to an injunction should be covered by the familiar four factor test this Court has applied in cases such as Weinberger v. Romero Barcelo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.754" offset="6132255">This Court's express endorsement of the four factor test would provide disciplined guidance and a framework for the lower courts to evaluate whether or not a patent should issue in any particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.212" offset="6181992">The court of appeals in this case did not make express reference to the four factor test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.065" offset="6313440">We think that there is some legitimate confusion among the patent bar and in the community about whether or not this test issues nearly automatically or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1551.072" offset="6357430">And we think it's useful for this Court to make clear that this is an exercise of equitable discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.858" offset="6376656">Now, Judge Bryson, I think, was aware of the four factor test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.012" offset="6389195">In fact, both parties cited the four factor test before the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.464" offset="6403092">He was also aware of the abuse of discretion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.082" offset="6413541">That's a well established standard and the parties cited that standard to the Federal Circuit in the course of briefing this case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.486" offset="6439141">But what we think this Court can do is it can provide guidance on how those factors are applied in the patent context in this very important area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.640" offset="6467771">We think the court of appeals decision is correct.</text>
