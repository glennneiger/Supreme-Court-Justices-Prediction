            <text syncTime="12.783" offset="207882">Michelle McCottry's statements here were testimonial for the simple reason that she knowingly told a governmental agent associated with law enforcement that someone had committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.881" offset="248215">Prosecutions based on such ex parte statements in place of live testimony strike at the very heart of the evil the Confrontation Clause is designed to prevent, trials on the basis of out of court accusations.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.976" offset="296593">Indeed, the trial here really can't be described as anything other than inquisitorial in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.649" offset="319372">The sole proof that Mr. Davis was at Ms. McCottry's house and assaulted her that day was the 4-minute, tape recorded 911 police incident interview that the State played at Mr. Davis' trial and that it itself described as Ms. McCottry's testimony on the day this happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="73.608" offset="451134">What it does and what I'm trying to do for this Court is, first, draw back the lens for a moment and look at the kind of trial that we end up with when statements of the... like fresh accusations in this case, are able to be used in place of live testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.606" offset="675160">Well, we don't believe, under the proper conception of the Confrontation Clause, it matters who the accusatory statement is initiated by.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.935" offset="700446">Certainly we believe the Confrontation Clause should apply if Ms. McCottry had simply walked out of her house and walked down the street to the police station and voluntarily walked into the sheriff's office and said, I want to report what Mr. Davis just did.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.845" offset="752064">What we... what we suggest here today is there's no difference if she simply calls on the telephone to a 911 operator, which the State itself in its brief calls a conduit to the police, and so when the... when the police and when the State have set up a system for people to report calls more expeditiously... I'm sorry... report crimes more expeditiously, we don't think the answer is any different.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.412" offset="854360">That is, this is not just a call.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.726" offset="867630">This is a cry for help.</text>

            <text syncTime="180.680" offset="879437">Well, there... in... in a sense, of course, Ms. McCottry is seeking help at the same time she's reporting a crime, but the... the mere fact that the two are intertwined does not take us outside the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.807" offset="935966">Of course, in the Indiana case that you're going to hear, you're going to hear the same thing, that the person is asking for help in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.433" offset="958432">So when somebody makes a call, which we might call a mixed motive or a dual purpose call, the question that we think this Court should ask is whether... whether that's the kind of a statement, first of all, that historically would have been viewed as implicating the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.810" offset="1019976">And if you look at the hue... the old hue and cry practice that we've referred to in our briefs, Sir Matthew Hale in his treatise explains that when somebody went and got the local constable, what they were doing is they were seeking help, first and foremost, to apprehend a felon, and more than that, they were also reporting the crime in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.115" offset="4937194">And then we have perhaps the gray area, where a witness goes missing through no fault of anybody's, and this Court has said over and over again that there the confrontation right puts the onus onto the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.183" offset="6173517">One is that the caller said that a man named Mike was at her house during the entire event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.215" offset="6197550">When the police showed up at her house some 5 minutes later, they never even got Mike's last name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.919" offset="6220433">And, of course, Justice Breyer, the reason why is because they were probably thinking of the Roberts framework and that they wouldn't need this witness, but good old fashioned police work would have presumably found a witness that witnessed the whole event that they could have put on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.892" offset="6272260">The second thing the State could have done in this case is they could have filed the case in a way that they obtained a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.486" offset="6294726">If what the State says is correct that Ms. McCottry was cooperating up until the last minute, that's a classic scenario where, by way of having a preliminary hearing and subjecting her to cross examination at the preliminary hearing, they could have preserved her testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.395" offset="6346344">This Court in California against Green and Roberts itself said that those kinds of prior pretrial cross examination scenarios are good enough to satisfy the Confrontation Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.478" offset="8762670">And she didn't do that because her training, as documented in the training materials from the Valley Communications Center, said don't get caught up in the background information that led to this event because it can distract you in getting the information that needs to be transferred to the police department right away.</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.789" offset="9307898">The record isn't fully developed on that point, but it sounds like that... that Mike was a friend of the defendant's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.728" offset="9335692">And we know for sure that Mike left with the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2305.543" offset="9378951">And in fact, if it was a friend of the defendant, you'd think that the Compulsory Process Clause would have given the defendant some basis on which to bring him before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.732" offset="9419702">I don't think that that includes any of the... that... that doesn't somehow shift the burden on the defendant in the same way it might if were to force him to bring the declarant in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.453" offset="9462543">If he knew Mike, he... he certainly had the ability to bring Mike in.</text>

            <text syncTime="2334.892" offset="9496293">Your Honor, I... I do want to return for just one moment to this notion that we don't want witnesses to testify and that we are satisfied with proceeding just on... on the basis of other pieces of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.192" offset="9549478">At least in my practice and at least in our county, that's definitely not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.522" offset="9570794">In fact, even if we have a recanting witness in, for example, the domestic violence abuse scenario... situation, it is often just as effective for us to go ahead and put... put the witness up on the stand, let her tell whatever story she's presently telling, and then play the 911... 911 tape also in conjunction with the testimony of the officers who can describe what... what condition she was in when they arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.136" offset="9669328">And I think when you juxtapose the 911 tape, even with the recantation from the witness, frankly sometimes the jurors find it even more illuminating than... than if she didn't appear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.653" offset="11999346">If you look closely at their constable cases, which is the closest cases that they... they submit, one of them is a report from the Old Bailey online source which contains transcripts of criminal trials in... in England, and one of them, the Radbourne case, is right around the time of the framing, and there's a little line in the transcript where the constable says, well, I bent down and I asked the victim something and then the judge says, well, don't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.752" offset="12107702">There's no evidence that that was regarded as a... a legal ruling under confrontation principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.504" offset="12138735">There's no evidence that the Framers were aware of that Radbourne Old Bailey report, and there's additional statutory basis in the treason statute, which was applicable there, which said that all evidence had to be given face to face.</text>

            <text syncTime="3101.089" offset="12561083">Justice Scalia, first of all, there is evidence that the hue and cry practice existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.762" offset="12583757">There is not evidence about how hue and cry reports were viewed as a matter of evidence law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.312" offset="12609984">It is very difficult to transpose into 17th and 18th century English practice what we are dealing with now, in part because the system of public prosecutions that we have today where an official prosecutor representing the State carries the ball in a criminal case did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.095" offset="12681142">The accuser had to appear in court as the private prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.877" offset="12696293">If the accuser did not appear, there was no prosecution, and these prosecutions were simply dismissed because there was no one official on the scene to carry the ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.115" offset="12733178">So the... the speculation that's required requires a number of inferential leaps that petitioners have to make in order to draw an analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.320" offset="12774033">And at the same time, there really is an intuitive difference between the kinds of statements that people make in emergencies and the kind of core testimonial statements that we know prompted the confrontation right, the Sir Walter Raleigh case involving affidavits and letters, the Marian practice under which testimony was formally taken in the calm of a magistrate's rooming house rather than in the immediate aftermath or time when a crime was actually ongoing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3241.449" offset="13122507">And so for that reason, the rule that we're describing here for the Court would deal with not only the present emergency but also its imminent, threatened recurrence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3287.005" offset="13304737">Now, the Court could accept that line and say that jewelry thief reports are not testimony within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause, or it could disagree and say that no, when there's not the immediate threatened, imminent potential for a recurrence of the violence, then we're going to treat that as closer to simply a report of a crime and treat it as testimonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.572" offset="13391046">The Court could go either way on that without touching the core of what's at issue today, which is namely emergency situations that pose a threat to the safety of the person who's making the call or who's encountered by a law enforcement officer on the scene in the immediate aftermath of an attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.677" offset="13591457">I'd hasten to add, Justice Scalia, that that kind of information is very important for the officers to know to gauge the seriousness of the threat, to get the kind of idea of who they are dealing with, and to respond effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.555" offset="13642970">So it is reasonably necessary for those kinds of questions and that information to be elicited.</text>

            <text syncTime="3423.706" offset="13851532">First, in the record it's always been accepted in this case that Mr. Davis had left the house when the 911 call started.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.566" offset="13879013">In the joint appendix, page 117, that's what the Washington Supreme Court said, and at page 30 of the evidentiary hearing in the trial court, the prosecutor submitted the case that way as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.023" offset="13920809">Now let me address the history here because it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.555" offset="13938990">And Justice Scalia is exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.696" offset="13947558">There's not a single case historically where a statement to a law enforcement agent accusing someone of a crime was admitted in a criminal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3461.479" offset="14002624">The... the oldest case that is in the briefs on the other side is White v. Illinois in 1992.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.027" offset="14024881">So for some 500 years before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.074" offset="14033031">And... and perhaps when we have to draw an inference, we do have... to a certain degree we acknowledge the dog that doesn't bark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.530" offset="14058840">We have evidence that was out there and simply wasn't used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.999" offset="14068766">Let's look at the history of the Marian statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.624" offset="14079215">And I'm... and I want to refer the specifically to page 101 of Sir Matthew Hale's treatise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.437" offset="14098442">He talks about the... both the problem with the hue and cry and then the reason we have the Marian statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.986" offset="14116727">The reason we have the Marian statutes was because for pretrial bail and committal hearings, the courts were not prepared to simply go on the initial reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.175" offset="14149433">They wanted a formal examination of the witness to use at even the pretrial hearing, to detain the person pending trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.504" offset="14174719">And Sir Matthew Hale at page 101 says the problem with the fresh reports of the hue and cry, is that... is that they're not under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.396" offset="14198334">They don't... they don't even answer all the questions that we would want answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.913" offset="14208365">So what the United States is asking you to accept is that the kind of evidence that the Framers would not have even been prepared to allow at a pretrial bail hearing... rather, they wanted to have something more formal... they would now accept to be used in the trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.150" offset="14269282">And what we think is that this turns everything on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.572" offset="14282970">The reason the Marian statutes were abused is because, of course, in continental Europe that was an accepted form of evidence, and so there was some reason to believe these formal statements could be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.325" offset="14322050">No one ever suggested that hue and cry could be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.591" offset="14331140">Finally, let me say a word about police incentives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.951" offset="14340544">If you accept the rule that the... that the United States and... and the State is asking you to accept, think about the incentives you put on 911 operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.125" offset="14373250">They're not supposed to ask too many questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.344" offset="14382131">They're not supposed to get too much information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.281" offset="14389864">The same would go for the responding officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.376" offset="14398223">They don't want to ask too many questions, structured questions, make sure who did it, make sure they have the details because then somehow these statements become testimonial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.580" offset="14435003">What our rule says is it frees the 911 operator, it frees the police officers to do what they're supposed to do, which is immediately start responding and both help people and start gathering evidence from the moment that a crime is reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.912" offset="14488397">And that's what we think the Confrontation Clause is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.491" offset="14498742">It's not... it's about the way the case is proved at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.179" offset="14513475">The Confrontation Clause... as opposed to other emergency doctrines this Court has in the Fourth Amendment area, for example, the Confrontation Clause has zero to say about the way police officers do their jobs or the way the 911 operators do their jobs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3656.318" offset="14782014">Well, this Court noticed that Professor Wigmore had the view that the Confrontation Clause applied only to witnesses that actually took the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.288" offset="14805837">So he would have thought the Confrontation Clause didn't apply at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.726" offset="14815659">But he would have acknowledged to you... and this is interesting from his treatise... that these were testimonial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.103" offset="14837184">He said as soon as somebody starts... as soon as in a criminal trial we use a statement narrating a past event, it's testimonial.</text>
