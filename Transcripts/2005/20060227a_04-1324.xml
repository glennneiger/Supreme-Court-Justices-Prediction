            <text syncTime="1329.416" offset="5469015">--Well, we disagree that this was up front, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.984" offset="5479360">The answer in a... habeas corpus cases, of course, heavily deals with the merits, as it did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.440" offset="5501094">And then, Mr. Day replied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.615" offset="5509871">And, as the State's amicus brief points out, that's all that usually happens in most habeas corpus cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.984" offset="5535262">So, we were near the end of the proceeding, as... if you think of the run of the mine habeas corpus case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.280" offset="5556473">And, also, speaking of run of the mine habeas corpus cases, this is a very rare instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.757" offset="5578416">There are... there are lots of procedures for courts to vindicate the interest that the State describes in comity, finality, and federalism, whether inviting a motion to... whether ordering the State to file a motion to dismiss under Rule 4, which we submit would be the proper procedure, or, if the State fails to raise it in its answer in certain circumstances, inviting them to file a motion to amend under Rule 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.143" offset="5679980">That takes care of these interests in the run of the mine case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.442" offset="5693146">There's no need to vindicate those interests in this case by creating an exception to the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.402" offset="5716969">This Court has said, in Lonchar and in Carlisle, that where there are civil rules that deal with the... and habeas rules... that deal with how these things happen, the Court cannot use its inherent powers to circumvent those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.962" offset="5771200">And we submit that that's exactly what the court did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.379" offset="5780917">Now, in addition, I'd like to point the Court to New York versus Hill, which is not cited in our briefs, but can be found at 528 U.S. at 114 to 15 and also 118, on this express waiver issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.259" offset="5844447">And this is a case where the Court recognized exactly the point that we make here, that not all... you don't always have to show intentional relinquishment of a known right for that to be the standard for waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.739" offset="5898364">It depends on the right at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.423" offset="5905051">There, it was an International Agreement on Detainers Act case, and the Court held that the... that the defendant's assent to delay waived the time limitation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, expressly waived it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.288" offset="5952489">And that's our... that's our position here, is that the State's affirmative pleading of timeliness is an express waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.176" offset="5976104">In addition, the State could... certainly couldn't prevail, under the Brady versus U.S. standard that applies to plea agreements, for saying that its concession was not knowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.202" offset="6024169">There's no... there's no suggestion here that the State was misled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.924" offset="6039112">There's no suggestion that they didn't have all the information they needed to make the calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.163" offset="6063980">And Brady says that simply misapprehending a factor... a relevant factor in the analysis is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.420" offset="6089058">And that's at 397 U.S. at page 757.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.804" offset="6106612">In addition, the State makes an argument about policies beyond the concerns of the parties, and that the State... that those should be vindicated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.856" offset="6150811">But I'd like to point out that this Court has not adopted the</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.501" offset="6169410">test; rather, it's acknowledged that Congress entrusts even important public policies, like comity, finality, and federalism, to the adversary process; and, thus, their... and even private rights that benefit society can be waived, in Christiansburg Garment, for example.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.221" offset="6276303">The District Court's sua sponte action here was consistent with AEDPA and the habeas rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.276" offset="6308486">And it was consistent with the purpose behind, and not prohibited by, Federal Rules 8 and 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.836" offset="6334713">This case is not about the State's waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.184" offset="6348088">And we would agree that... with Justice Scalia, that the waiver is not the beginning and end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.522" offset="6369508">We're not conceding that the State, in fact, waived it here, but we're saying that that's not essential to the answer to this question, because it's not the beginning and the end of the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.848" offset="6402736">This case is also not about, as the Petitioner alleges in the brief and makes inference on the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, about obligating courts to act in all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.707" offset="6442233">This case is about the proper exercise of discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2604.492" offset="10569371">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.430" offset="10621094">There is nothing in either the habeas rules or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that deprives the District Court of its authority sua sponte to recognize the untimeliness of a habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.790" offset="10674488">To the contrary, to the extent the rules speak to the issue at all, they confirm that in light of the significant social cost of Federal review of State Court convictions, the Federal Courts have a unique responsibility to weed out unmeritorious claims and to enforce the limitations on habeas review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.584" offset="10757662">Rule 4 imposes an obligation on the court to dismiss unmeritorious petitions without even calling for an answer by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.216" offset="10800189">Now, Rule 4 is not applicable here, but the absence of an obligation to note the deficiency sua sponte does not connote a prohibition on acting sua sponte; rather, it suggests that it lies in the court's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.712" offset="10874272">That is exactly how this Court addressed similar question in Granberry, where it rejected the two extremes... one, recognizing the limitation as jurisdictional, that the court was obligated to raise it sua sponte, but also rejecting the opposite extreme, that the court was prohibited to address an issue that had not been preserved in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.576" offset="11481672">And there may well be circumstances where it would be an abuse of discretion to interject a timeliness objection.</text>

            <text syncTime="2887.182" offset="11700055">Here, as Your Honor noted earlier, this was the first thing that happened in the District Court after the filing of the petition, the answer, and the reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.900" offset="11738925">There was no waste of judicial resources by the fact that it was raised sua sponte by the court in the first thing that the court did after that briefing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.886" offset="11774870">There was no prejudice to the Petitioner, because it was omitted from the State's responsive pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.831" offset="11806739">There is... as the Court said in Granberry, the failure to plead it perhaps waives the District... the State's opportunity to insist on the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.063" offset="11863582">The State, because it said, in its answer here, erroneously, that the petition was timely filed, or if it had said nothing, would have waived its opportunity to stand on, and insist on, that defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.698" offset="12202129">And obviously, as the State suggested, if the State didn't want to stand on the statute of limitations defense because, for example, it was particularly messy, there was going to be a lot of litigation about equitable tolling, it would in inappropriate for the court to insist on litigating that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.773" offset="12342458">it would inappropriate for the State to try to force the Federal Court to litigate that issue instead of the State Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.389" offset="12388956">And that's what the Court did in Granberry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.816" offset="12398674">It remanded... after setting aside both extreme positions, it remanded to the Court of Appeals for a case specific application of discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.173" offset="12500029">--and, of course, that's true if the State has preserved the defense... there were three other points in the Court of Appeals opinion where it used discretionary or nonmandatory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.070" offset="12551647">For example, at petition appendix 4(a), the court said that the District Court "may dismiss".</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.199" offset="12588218">At the petition appendix 5(a), it said that the State's failure to raise "does not bar" the court from acting sua sponte.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Brett Busby</label>
            <text syncTime="3185.656" offset="12893956">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.248" offset="12908375">I'd like to begin by addressing the "must" versus "may" issue that Counsel discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.984" offset="12931258">For the reasons I mentioned, I think the better reading of the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is that there was an obligation, and that the most clear indication of that is its distinction of Esslinger, which expressly applied a Granberry type analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.962" offset="12979219">But, even if the Court believes that the Eleventh Circuit was only saying "may", and that the District Court was only saying "may", and recognized the that it had discretion... and there is a footnote in the magistrate's opinion that cites to Jackson that says, "We have discretion"... I would submit that if you read Jackson, it's a standardless discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.817" offset="13054661">There are no factors anywhere in Jackson of the type that this Court discussed in Granberry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.942" offset="13075141">It... and there's no indication that the... that the magistrate judge considered any of those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.043" offset="13099592">There's no indication that the Eleventh Circuit considered any of those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.281" offset="13112548">And it's certainly an abuse of discretion for a court to apply the wrong legal standard or fail to consider the relevant factors that channel that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.125" offset="13143895">And so, we... our position is that, because the factors under Rule 15 and the other factors in our brief were not applied, that a remand, at a minimum, is appropriate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.693" offset="13182138">Also, I'd like to speak to Granberry and Caspari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.343" offset="13196767">Again, those involve exhaustion and nonretroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.874" offset="13210873">And I submit that it's not correct to characterize those two doctrines as affirmative defenses; rather, the way that Congress codified them is on... as substantive limits on relief, unlike "limitations", which it just said "period of limitations", which the commonly accepted meaning is an "affirmative defense".</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.917" offset="13279001">And so, that makes those very different from an affirmative defense, in terms of sua sponte consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.306" offset="13304601">Also, both "exhaustion" and "nonretroactivity" are unique to habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.819" offset="13322677">They're not mentioned anywhere in Rules 8 and 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.307" offset="13332604">Whereas, "limitations", of course, is mentioned explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.035" offset="13343471">And so, our position is that Rule 8 and 12, not necessarily always, but at least in all but extraordinary cases, would prevent the judge from raising this sua sponte.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.489" offset="13389342">Also, I would say that the rules that we rely on don't deprive the court of sua sponte authority, they channel that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.162" offset="13420062">Under Rule 4, they can plead it, or the court can make a motion to dismiss... ask the... order the State to make a motion to dismiss based on limitations under Habeas Rule 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.881" offset="13458932">They can plead it in their answer, under Habeas Rule 5 and Civil Rules 8 and 12, or they can amend their answer, under Civil Rule 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.602" offset="13485786">That's the way the drafters of the rules wanted them to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.723" offset="13498220">And Lonchar and Carlisle say they cannot... that a judge cannot use his sua sponte power to circumvent the requirements of those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.384" offset="13528940">Finally, I'd like to mention that civil... the statutes of limitations in civil cases also implicate broader social interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.474" offset="13557257">And some of them, we've discussed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.461" offset="13565198">And, even more so, because there are lots of protections in AEDPA cases that don't apply in civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.476" offset="13585260">There are presumptions of correctness and those sorts of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.166" offset="13599993">But courts in civil cases, nonetheless, say that statutes of limitations can be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.652" offset="13617965">And the result should be no different here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.926" offset="13623085">Thank you.</text>
