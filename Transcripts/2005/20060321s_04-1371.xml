            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="9.958" offset="128422">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.918" offset="152245">We granted review to resolve a conflict between the 2nd and 7th Circuits over the extent to which the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 preempts plaintiffs from bringing certain class actions under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.053" offset="220791">The respondent in this case is a former Merrill Lynch broker who brought a class action under Oklahoma law, alleging that Merrill Lynch had breached state-law duties that it owed to its brokers by disseminating research, misleading research and thereby manipulating stock prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.740" offset="299471">His complaint encompassed what are known as holder claims, claims that the brokers were injured because they continued to hold their stocks long beyond the point when, had the truth been known, they would have sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.481" offset="354433">These holder claims are different from claims brought by purchasers or sellers alleging a particular transaction of purchase or sale was wrongfully induced.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.273" offset="401662">The Federal District Court dismissed the case, concluding that it was preempted by the 1998 Act, which provides that no covered class action based upon state law and alleging a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.849" offset="503958">On appeal however, the 2nd Circuit reached a different conclusion, reasoning that holder claims are not, “in connection with the purchase or sale”, of a security within the meaning of the 1998 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.699" offset="559338">The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 generally prohibit fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.944" offset="604373">Ever since 1946, federal courts have recognized a private federal cause of action for damages for violations of Rule 10b-5, but we have held that only purchasers or sellers may invoke that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.070" offset="668843">Thus, respondent in this case does not have a federal remedy for his alleged injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.277" offset="693711">On the other hand, in enforcement actions initiated by the SEC, we have broadly construed the “in connection with” phrase to encompass a variety of situations in which investors other than actual purchasers or sellers are the injured parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.870" offset="764033">The 1998 Act that we construe today broadly preempts a large category of class actions that are based on state law and allege fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.803" offset="823801">The question for decision, then, is whether the act only preempts state law class actions for which federal law provides a remedy, as the 2nd Circuit held, or whether, as the 7th Circuit has held, it also preempts state-law class actions for which there is no federal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.887" offset="896108">We conclude that the broad interpretation of the “in connection with” phrase that we have accepted in SEC enforcement actions is the meaning that Congress intended in the 1998 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.714" offset="947413">This conclusion is supported not only by the statute’s text, but also by the concerns that led to its enactment; namely, that Congress believed that lawyers who were bringing securities class actions in state court were invoking their state remedies to avoid the necessity of complying with an earlier federal statute that had tightened the requirements for bringing securities class actions under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.459" offset="1062351">Our conclusion is consistent with the presumption that Congress does not cavalierly preempt state law causes of action, because the 1998 Act does not actually preempt any cause of action, but rather merely denies plaintiffs the right to use the class-action device to vindicate a carefully defined category of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.771" offset="1147615">Moreover, it is federal law rather than state law that has long provided the principle basis for asserting class-action securities-fraud acclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.262" offset="1185649">Thus, this is by no means a case in which a federal statute has eliminated a historically entrenched state-law remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.429" offset="1218250">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit and remand for further proceedings consistent with our unanimous opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.126" offset="1257016">Justice Alito did not participate in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
