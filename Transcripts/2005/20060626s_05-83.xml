            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="88451">The second case I have to announce is No, 05-83, Washington versus Recuenco.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.633" offset="122933">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.479" offset="146338">Respondent was convicted of assault in the second degree, based on the jury’s finding that he assaulted his wife with a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.391" offset="185940">The trial court then applied a three-year firearm enhancement to respondent’s sentence, based on the Court’s own factual finding that the deadly weapon at issue was a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.951" offset="240170">On direct appeal to the Washington Supreme Court, the State conceded that this enhancement to respondent’s sentence was imposed in violation of our decision in Blakely versus Washington, but argued that the error was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.218" offset="309238">The Washington Supreme Court disagreed, holding that Blakely errors are structural in nature and, thus, can never be harmless and vacated respondent’s sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.624" offset="362946">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.826" offset="387710">Most Constitutional errors are subject to harmless-error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.754" offset="407458">An error is structural and requires automatic reversal only when it, “necessarily renders a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence”.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.703" offset="475168">In Neder versus United States, we determined that a trial court’s failure to require a jury to find an element of an offense was not structural error.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.771" offset="519471">This case is controlled by Neder.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.374" offset="529920">The only difference between Neder and this case is that in Neder the jury failed to find an element of the offense, while in the present case the jury failed to find a sentencing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.200" offset="581225">In Apprendi versus New Jersey we recognized that, “any possible distinction between an element of an offense and a sentencing factor was unknown to the practice of criminal indictment, trial by jury and judgment by jury as it existed during the year surrounding our nation’s founding”.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.139" offset="668996">Accordingly, failure to prove a sentencing factor to a jury, like failure to prove an element of an offense to a jury, is not structural error.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.346" offset="713822">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.239" offset="749349">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion; Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Stevens has joined.</text>
