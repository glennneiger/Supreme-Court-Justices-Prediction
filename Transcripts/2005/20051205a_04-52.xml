            <text syncTime="93.520" offset="516554">In this instance, the Ninth Circuit professes fealty to AEDPA deference, but it seems simply too easy, having sensed a constitutional injury, to become willing to attribute error to the State court and to substitute its own factual inferences for those of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.966" offset="618328">The way the Court decides this case can provide further instruction to habeas courts to help them avoid the Ninth Circuit error.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.287" offset="659601">I'd suggest at least four instructions that might be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.052" offset="678618">First, confirming that the objective reasonableness test, that inquiry under (d)(2), is like that currently under (d)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="145.395" offset="723967">That is, the factual inquiry, like that under the legal inquiry, more deferential than review for clear error.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.852" offset="757821">Second, since it seems logical that State fact finding should be entitled to equal, if not greater, respect than that now accorded State court resolution of legal issues under (d)(1), we've argued for adoption of the Jackson v. Virginia kind of standard as consistent with the letter and spirit of AEDPA, meaning that witness credibility determinations rarely may be overturned, and that all of the evidence must be reviewed in the light most favorable to the fact finder.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.897" offset="898047">Third, although Miller El v. Dretke represented an extraordinarily egregious and I personally think undeniable violation of Batson, some might react to a whiff of a little smoke as a Miller El fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.017" offset="966488">Proper resolution of this case can make it clear that Miller El v. Dretke dealt with a outlier and that the traditional line of this Court's habeas cases, restricting Federal courts from second guessing a State judge's credibility calls, retain their vitality.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.631" offset="1048930">Finally and specifically responding to Mr. Collins' argument that this case, it seems, is an opportunity to confirm the well established presumption of correctness for State court fact finding under section 2254(e)(1), that it remains available in all habeas cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.860" offset="1129910">Collins' view that the traditional presumption now applies only in the rare case of Federal evidentiary hearings would eviscerate the traditional presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.112" offset="1186857">Well, it is... it is a little unusual to have under your view two different sections, both addressed to the question of the appropriate standard of review in a particular type of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.324" offset="1227712">They seem either redundant or overlapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.805" offset="1241609">The theory on the other side at least distinguishes them and argues that they apply in different circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.320" offset="1275673">--That's true, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.536" offset="1284554">Our view is that the (e)(1) test really focuses on specific facts that have been found in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.628" offset="1316946">The (d)(2) focus is on the decision, which presumably would be a bundle of multiple facts, the decision of the court and whether it was objectively unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.859" offset="1369818">And to limit the (e)(1) presumption not only, I think, being contrary to congressional intention when AEDPA reforms were adopted, and your cases that have applied both (e)(1) and (d)(2) as separate, independent tests... in my office, there are 320 attorneys that do Federal habeas work, 120,000 hours of lawyering.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.206" offset="1499281">If you take out the capital cases, the non capital Federal habeas claims, only 2 or 3 percent ever go to a Federal evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.402" offset="1548078">So the result of reading that (e)(1) without the presumption in the cold record case means basically the State loses the presumption for almost every habeas claim that we look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.208" offset="1607219">So it would seem to not be also supported by the statute's clear terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.406" offset="1632088">There's no limitation written into (e)(1) that it... it's... doesn't apply across the board to all habeas claims.</text>

I think that reading the transcript will show that the judge, hearing the Batson motion, asking counsel to explain the reasons for her strikes, allowing defense counsel to comment and explain, and then the ruling of the judge seems to be a general one, both contemplating both demeanor and youthfulness, and benefit of the doubt may refer back to the fact that there's a dispute about the challenged juror and whether she turned aside, rolled her eyes in a dismissive and disrespectful way.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.225" offset="1963320">And the judge says, well, I didn't see that behavior, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.319" offset="11367715">But the case specific evidence is similar to Miller El in important respects, and Miller El requires relief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.319" offset="11395719">First... first of all, three of the reasons given here for the strikes pertain just as well to non black jurors as to the black jurors, and that's youth, tolerance, and single.</text>

            <text syncTime="3018.324" offset="12215754">By contrast, this Court stated in Schlup v. Delo, that the assessment of credibility is generally beyond the scope of review in Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.559" offset="12260685">And in the Crenshaw case cited by the State, the Court explained that under Jackson, the test for rejecting evidence as incredible is extraordinarily stringent and is met, for example, only when the testimony given is describing facts that are physically impossible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3253.924" offset="13158148">First, with respect to juror 19, I think it's the best clear way to see what the Ninth Circuit did and what Collins continues to do, which is to substitute their reading, their inferences, and then conclude that anyone that disagrees is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.538" offset="13232545">Juror 19... if you read page 5, it's clearly a slip of the tongue where she accidentally is comparing the two young people, 6, and says 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.536" offset="13268594">Immediately afterward, she says 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.564" offset="13280714">And the defense counsel says, well, who is 6?</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.975" offset="13294298">She says, it's the other young person, the young white person that I struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.667" offset="13309136">That slip of the tongue is the heart of the Ninth Circuit effort and analysis to do, as the dissenters said in the en banc denial, nitpick the record to find some circumstantial evidence to support your view of inferences and conclusions about reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.790" offset="13405580">I think that partly makes the case and especially with a statute where deference is so owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.557" offset="13428672">The gender claim is ambiguous, but it was not a challenge based solely on race and the circuits are split on the mixed motive question, as Justice Stevens indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.951" offset="13486246">Second, Third, Fourth, Eighth, and Eleventh, and in one opinion in the Ninth, they've addressed mixed motives generally saying your clearly established Federal law says that it has to be solely based on race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.169" offset="13551134">That's the current test in the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.653" offset="13557090">We raised Jackson and... Jackson v. Virginia just because of the Lockyer v. Andrade case in which the Court indicates that clear error, when we talk about objective reasonableness in understanding (d)(2) and (d)(1) in the case of Andrade, that it's more than clear error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.930" offset="13658132">So we're trying to figure out, well, what's more than clear error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.573" offset="13676731">We don't know what it might be other than seeing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trier of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.338" offset="13711735">And finally, with respect to youth, clearly it's reasonable for a judge to look at the demeanor of the DA who's saying again and again and again it's a young person, unmarried, no ties in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.606" offset="13772861">One of the things we didn't talk about is the DA who's from Los Angeles knows that that juror lives in Inglewood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.955" offset="13798252">Now, there are different kind of neighborhoods in Inglewood, but a lot of them are neighborhoods with lots of drug dealing, and he might think or she might think, in this instance, it shows naivete to answer the question that there's never drug dealing in my neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.639" offset="13868992">Well, for all those concerns, they're not implausible, they're not fantastic, as you know from the decisions that the reasons can be superstitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.926" offset="13918102">They can be silly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.703" offset="13969198">But that's basically our contention, that deference was owed and the Ninth Circuit didn't respect that deference to trial judge that we rely on for credibility determinations.</text>
