            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="88455">I have the opinion in 05-502 Brigham City versus Stuart.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.776" offset="115518">At about 3 o’ clock in the morning, four Brigham City Utah police officers responded to a call regarding a loud party at a residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.228" offset="153343">When they arrived at the house, they heard shouting from inside coming from the back of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.918" offset="176122">They proceeded down the driveway to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.022" offset="188452">From the backyard, they could see into the home’s kitchen through a screen door and windows.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.121" offset="212902">There was an altercation taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.624" offset="222933">Four adults were trying to restrain a juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.634" offset="238920">The juvenile broke free and punched one of the adults in the face.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.494" offset="254385">The victim went to spit blood into a sink while the other adults continued trying to subdue the juvenile.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.907" offset="284060">One of the officers opened the screen door and yelled in ‘Police’, but the ruckus from the fight was too loud, nobody heard him.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.506" offset="318437">So he stepped into the kitchen and again cried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.137" offset="332961">As people gradually became aware that the police were on the scene, the altercation subsided.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.029" offset="364517">The officers then arrested several of the adults for Disorderly Conduct, Intoxication and Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.041" offset="400566">The Trial Court excluded all evidence obtained after the officers entered the home on the ground that the officer’s entry violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.815" offset="439645">On appeal, the Supreme Court of Utah also concluded that the officer’s entry was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.781" offset="467544">The Court said that the injury caused by the juvenile’s punch was not serious enough to allow the officers to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.974" offset="500249">This is because, the Court said, it could not have led a reasonable officer to believe that an unconscious, semiconscious, or missing person feared injured or dead was in the home; we granted review.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.459" offset="562212">The Fourth Amendment generally prohibits officers from entering a private home without a warrant; but there are certain exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.915" offset="592096">For example, officers may enter without a warrant to fight a fire or when they are in pursuit of a fleeing felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.901" offset="623965">If the situation confronting officers is serious enough to make immediate entry reasonable, the Fourth Amendment will allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.443" offset="662208">One such situation is the need to protect life or avoid imminent serious injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.698" offset="687182">The defendants in this case don’t dispute this, but make two arguments why the officers still could not enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.755" offset="715394">First, they claimed that the officers here were more interested in making arrests than in quelling violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.430" offset="742143">They want us to consider the officers’ subjective motivation for entering the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.867" offset="763877">Our cases reject this approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.381" offset="773908">An action is reasonable under The Fourth Amendment as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively justify the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.722" offset="811315">The defendants also argue that their conduct was not serious enough to justify the officers’ entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.349" offset="837751">We think however, that the officers had an objectively reasonable basis for believing both that the injured adult might need help, and that the violence in the kitchen was just beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.984" offset="884354">The Fourth Amendment did not require the officers to wait until another blow rendered someone unconscious or semiconscious or worse before entering.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.030" offset="924478">Police officer is not like a boxing referee who only steps in to stop a fight when it becomes too one-sided.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.703" offset="955198">The way the officers entered the home was also reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.414" offset="970035">After witnessing the punch, one of the officers opened the screen door and yelled in ‘Police’. When nobody heard him, he stepped into the kitchen and announced himself again.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.919" offset="1012040">Given the noise and violence in the kitchen, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment’s ‘knock-and-announce’ rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.576" offset="1042656">For reasons stated more fully in an opinion filed this morning with the clerk, we therefore reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.598" offset="1074839">The decision is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.384" offset="1081944">Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
