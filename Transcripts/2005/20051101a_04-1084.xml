            <text syncTime="3239.204" offset="13109597">If this Court were to do anything less than that, it's really to deny Congress's intent and Congress's policy here, because Congress's policy is that religious freedom, religious liberty, shall not be burdened unless, and until, the Government meets its burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.182" offset="13185561">The District Court clearly found, and said, that the Government did not show a risk of harm, did not show a risk of diversion; and, therefore, he found that the Government did not meet its compelling interests in this case.</text>
