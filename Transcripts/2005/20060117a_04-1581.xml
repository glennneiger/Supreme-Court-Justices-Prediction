            <text syncTime="9.491" offset="188917">Thank you, and Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="13.179" offset="203650">This case involves the fundamental First Amendment question of whether the Government can shield lawmakers from grassroots lobbying about upcoming votes in Congress through campaign finance laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.443" offset="248685">This Court has distinguished the regulation of corporate electioneering from efforts to influence law making, finding sufficiently compelling governmental interests in regulating electioneering, but not grassroots lobbying.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="38.466" offset="304796">Mr. Bopp, right... right there I guess I... I have a problem with... with your argument, and I just want to get it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.186" offset="331650">I went back and looked at some of the examples that were given at... in... in the McConnell case for parallels between what we... what we thought was covered in those cases and... and yours... your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.732" offset="393821">And the... the one which I... I guess was probably the closest was the... was the advertisements there in... in the McConnell case on the... the lobbying on the Chinese trade relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.432" offset="452649">The basic message in... in that case was China uses forced labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.808" offset="478145">The Congress of the United States is about to make it easier for... for Chinese goods to get in here and for China to have a respectable trade status.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.957" offset="510745">And... and it said, call Congressman Myrick, I think it was, in any case, a Member of Congress, and... and say what you think.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.281" offset="544078">In this case, you're... you're talking about a... a filibuster, and you say, you know, they're filibustering nominees and they're not coming up to... to a vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.429" offset="580649">Tell the two Senators in this State, Kohl and Feingold, that... that you don't like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.577" offset="609279">The only difference that I could see basically between the two kinds of ads was that in the first one... in... in the Myrick ad, they actually gave the number of the... of the congressional office to call and say, hey, don't do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.590" offset="661315">In this case, your clients did not give a... a number.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.316" offset="680228">They gave a Web site to an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.737" offset="689841">Insofar as I know, it doesn't have a number.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.748" offset="697887">Which gets me to the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.019" offset="706977">If the... the Chinese trade relations ad was presumably validly subject to the act, I don't see why your client's ad is not, for the same reason, subject to the act and for the further reason that it doesn't even give a phone number to call... to... to lobby people.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.107" offset="795376">So it seems to me that on stare decisis grounds, unless we're going to go back and simply reexamine McConnell to... to... from... from scratch, that your clients fall within the general rule as... as we held it in McConnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.152" offset="859532">So why doesn't precedent foreclose this?</text>

            <text syncTime="179.341" offset="868309">Well, there... there is a few specifics about the... about our ad that... that I would like to remind the Court of.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.988" offset="902896">First, it was not... the call to action at the end of the ad was not just call them up and tell them what you think.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.125" offset="927451">The call to action was to call the Senators and ask them to oppose the filibuster.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.001" offset="950961">So it was specific.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="201.178" offset="955663">Yes, but you didn't even give their phone numbers.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.953" offset="1010729">The decision was made by the speaker here that it would be more likely that the recipient of the ad would remember the phrase, [befairDOTorg,] and seek the information on that Web site than to have a... you know, a... a phone number that is just simply more difficult to... to remember.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.270" offset="1088051">So if we accept that extra step, that's... that gets you... if... if we accept the extra step that gets you parallel to the... to the ad that we considered in McConnell.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_bopp_jr" startTime="242.834" stopTime="247.793">
            <label>Mr. James Bopp, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="242.834" offset="1122220">Well, it... it doesn't, the one that you mentioned, because it was just call them up and--</text>

            <text syncTime="247.793" offset="1142073">If... if it's the fact that you go to the Web site and that's what's supposed to make this what it was in McConnell which, by the way, we said was illegal, what they... the first thing they're going to see when they get to the Web site, which I agree with you... four times in 3 of the 12 sentences of this ad... in 3 of the 12... it says, [befairDOTorg,] visit [befairDOTorg,] go to [befairDOTorg.]</text>
            <text syncTime="276.368" offset="1256385">And the first thing that they're going to see when they get to [befairDOTorg] is a big headline in bold... gold... bold letters which says, Feingold and Kohl continue to support unprecedented filibusters of judicial nominees.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.563" offset="1321168">So, in fact, if [befairDOTorg] is brought into the picture, that makes this ad look much more like an effort to... to defeat Senator Feingold than the ad that we considered in our previous case.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.412" offset="1412597">This Court recognized that it... that there were genuine issue ads that were not for the purpose of influencing an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.476" offset="1440809">I believe that these ads are at the very core of what a genuine issue ad is.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.935" offset="1462647">It involves a... a pending legislative issue, and the only reference to the Senator... and it was both Senators, not just the one up for election... was to contact them about... about how... whether to support or oppose that specific initiative.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.091" offset="1535268">--in McConnell, the Court said corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads during election blackout periods by simply avoiding any specific reference to Federal candidates or, in doubtful cases, by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.736" offset="1613844">Now, that language indicates, to me at least, that the Court was saying there are no genuine issue ads meeting the definition as you would have us apply it here.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.176" offset="1671627">Well, that... that part of the opinion needs to be read in light of the footnote, which is attached to those very words, which said in footnote 88 that the interests that support regulation of electioneering may not apply to genuine grassroots lobbying and distinguished the McConnell case from Bellotti and McIntyre.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.191" offset="1759712">So we do have to recognize that there's two things going on here.</text>

            <text syncTime="578.344" offset="2464287">And what that record showed with dozens, hundreds I think, of examples was the basis for Congress' conclusion that there's simply no way to know whether an ad like yours is a genuine issue ad or isn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.690" offset="11921658">Now, that's an example from intermediate scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.117" offset="11931376">Even in the strict scrutiny context, though, a case like Burson, I mean, this Court understood and said in the opinion, we can't tell whether 75 feet would be precisely okay or whether 90 feet or 100 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.630" offset="11977456">We don't have a scalpel to probe that either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.474" offset="11984874">But we're going to approve 100 feet because it's a basic way of dealing with this problem, identifying the area of potential concern, and people can do their electioneering 101 feet away.</text>

            <text syncTime="2972.509" offset="12040985">I think that is an approach that this Court has found acceptable, even in the First Amendment area, in dealing with these intractable problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="2992.341" offset="12120293">It's quite different between $1,000 and $2,000 or 100 feet and 75 feet and advocacy with respect to an election and advocacy with respect to an issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3026.103" offset="12255398">I think the real bottom line for the... your opponent is that even a pure election ad should get the same constitutional protection as an issue ad, which is something we've rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3035.845" offset="12294269">--Absolutely, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.273" offset="12300016">And of course, an even position one step intermediary from that or one step backtracking from that would be to say that all Congress can do in this area is regulate those ads that are unambiguously election oriented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.785" offset="12350066">And, of course, what's the class of those ads?</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.795" offset="12358112">Well, that would be express advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.306" offset="12364172">And the one thing that I think is clear from this Court's decision in McConnell is this Court made clear that express advocacy is not a constitutional line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.288" offset="12396042">Congress is not disempowered to go after mixed ads that are... yes, they have a component of issue ads, but you bet you they're intended to influence the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.529" offset="12433031">Those ads are what are at issue here, and I think in order to be able to regulate those in a way that makes sense, the key is to regulate in a way that's not vague, that's not overbroad, but is not so under inclusive that it can be easily evaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.219" offset="12487784">And I think Buckley shows how hard that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.240" offset="12495934">It's a tall order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.074" offset="12499278">In Buckley, this Court had a provision of FECA that prohibited independent expenditures related to a candidate election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.045" offset="12527072">The only way the Court could save that provision from the vagueness concern was to limit it to express advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.598" offset="12549328">But having done that, the Court said, well, it's so limited, it's so easy to evade, we're going to find that it fails strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.724" offset="12573883">In McConnell, this Court said that in BCRA, after careful study, Congress had actually found out a way to avoid those three pitfalls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.455" offset="12604708">All of the proposed alternatives of... of appellants run headlong into one or more of those obstacles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.258" offset="12631980">Look at the tests they've proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.185" offset="12639712">They've proposed looking at 16 factors, 4 details.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.552" offset="12653191">They disclaim any interest intent, but any of those tests I think would be vague and unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.000" offset="12670954">In contrast, they pluck a definition from the IRS regs that is designed to deal with 501(c)(3) corporations in a completely different context or a modification of a proposal by BCRA's sponsors, and they... and they put those tests out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.201" offset="12727692">And those would be very, very easy to evade in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.406" offset="12740545">In fact, I think if you use some of the tests that they propose or their amici proposed and you look at the body of ads that were before this Court in McConnell, you'd end up finding that a substantial percentage of them were grassroots lobbying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.153" offset="12787565">Well, if one thing has to be inconsistent with this Court's decision in McConnell, it's the conclusion that a substantial amount of the ads covered by this definition are unconstitutionally regulated because this Court clearly rejected a substantial overbreadth claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.343" offset="12844303">The one thing I would say in... in closing is to understand that Congress, having sort of voided these very difficult pitfalls of vagueness, overbreadth, and easy evasion, came up with this definition in title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.678" offset="12889651">But as this Court recognized in McConnell, title II of the statute does not stand alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.221" offset="12911803">It is part and parcel of the broader regulatory regime here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.326" offset="12924238">And without title II, title I's limitations on soft money contributions to parties will succeed only in taking that soft money and directing it to corporations that are closely aligned with candidates or with the parties themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.516" offset="12977005">This statutory as applied challenge that you have before it... you strikes at the heart of the McConnell decision and at the heart of BCRA's title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.924" offset="13014621">This Court should reject the invitation to revisit the McConnell decision and should give Congress' effort in this area a fair chance at success.</text>

            <text syncTime="3230.626" offset="13073449">What this... what plaintiffs are relying upon here is the distinction that this Court has made between lobbying, on the one hand, and political campaigns on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.367" offset="13108453">As summarized by Justice Stevens' concurrence in Austin, quote, there is a vast difference between lobbying and debating public issues, on the one hand, and political campaigns for election to public office on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.047" offset="13159131">And that is because that the interests that have justified the regulation of corporate electioneering do not apply to corporate--</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.184" offset="13187656">There is a vast difference, but the question I have is whether Congress has any voice in trying to draw the line that divides the two categories.</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.220" offset="13291833">Under strict scrutiny, you owe the fidelity of the Constitution, and the Constitution includes the right to petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.619" offset="13321403">So it is a difficult question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3298.745" offset="13345958">So your position basically would say we should take all of these cases on a case by case basis and not give any presumptive weight to what... what Congress has done.</text>

            <text syncTime="3306.059" offset="13375216">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.625" offset="13377410">I think that you can draw a rule that relies on objective criteria, just as you have in the Noerr Pennington doctrine, to distinguish between illegitimate efforts to... for predatory anticompetitive practices or monopolies, to distinguish between those and... and... the Court has even used the phrase, genuine efforts to influence Congress with respect to... or any governmental agency with respect to the adoption of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.961" offset="13494752">That has been based on objective criteria as the Court has explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.009" offset="13515023">You have adopted objective criteria to distinguish lawsuits that fall within the right to a petition or those that were brought illegitimately for anticompetitive reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.434" offset="13564656">It's not that this is... this exercise is an easy exercise, but it is demanded by the fact that the... the Congress adopted a very broad statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.269" offset="13608019">The only content in this electioneering communication provision... the only content requirement is that you name the candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.489" offset="13636858">And the reality is that those candidates often are incumbents and they are engaged in law making functions during these election periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.980" offset="13674892">I mean, there is a difference like in Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.752" offset="13685968">You know, Parliament is dissolved so that there... there is a bright line distinction between an election and Parliament actually exercising governmental power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.921" offset="13730585">But when these things overlap and when the Constitution demands the recognition of the right to petition, then that needs to be dealt with in this as applied challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.757" offset="13769978">Now, there's a vast... there's a huge number of... of lobby groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.205" offset="13787741">They have made a conscious decision that it is more important to them to influence what Government does today than to influence in a speculative and remote manner who is going to be exercising that power next year through elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.001" offset="13850958">Wisconsin Right to Life, in the face of these restrictions, have still decided that it's more important to lobby than it is to advocate the election or defeat of candidates and give money to candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.014" offset="13902994">The... this is just the reality of our complex Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.306" offset="13920130">It's the reality of the freedoms that individuals have to participate in that Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.682" offset="13941655">It's not just about elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.371" offset="13952417">It's more importantly about law making and citizens have a robust right to participate in that law making power, and as a result, this Court should recognize an as applied exception for grassroots lobbying.</text>
