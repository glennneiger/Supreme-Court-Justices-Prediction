            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="10.018" offset="128715">This is an Antitrust tying Clause case that comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for The Federal Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.605" offset="167062">Petitioners own patents on components of printing equipment that is used to print bar codes on a variety of packaging materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.233" offset="205619">Licensees of their patented equipment, the tying product, are required to buy specially designed, but unpatented ink, the tied product, from petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.286" offset="253789">Respondent, a competing producer of ink, contends that the tying arrangement violates Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.805" offset="283882">The District Court entered summary judgment for petitioners, because there was no proof that they possessed market power in the tying product; but the Court of Appeals reversed, relying on decisions of this Court that have held that the fact that the tying product is patented is sufficient to establish market power for antitrust purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.245" offset="365593">It concluded that even if the District Court’s decision represented sound policy, it was the duty of the Court of Appeals to follow our precedents until we choose to overrule them expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.366" offset="418151">The principal case supporting the presumption that a patent always establishes the market power is the International Salt Company against the United States, a case decided during the 1947 term.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.852" offset="476039">In that case, the Court accepted the Government’s submission that earlier cases applying a judicially created patent-misuse doctrine to tying arrangements should be applied in the antitrust context.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.983" offset="528597">The rule of the International Salt case was enthusiastically endorsed not only by the enforcement agencies, but also in later opinions stating the tying arrangements serve hardly any purpose beyond the suppression of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.542" offset="590768">Over the years, however, the rule was subjected to growing criticism by scholars and patent lawyers who pointed out that some tying arrangements actually benefit competition, and eventually the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission adopted a policy statement disavowing the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.011" offset="664643">Of greatest significance, however, in 1988, Congress amended the Patent Code to eliminate the market-power presumption in patent-misuse cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.947" offset="704453">After considering the Congressional judgment repudiating the patent-law rule that had provided the basis for the decision in the International Salt case, we have concluded that in antitrust tying cases, as in patent-misuse cases, market power must be established by proof rather than a mere presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.626" offset="787105">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.293" offset="817825">Our judgment is unanimous; Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
