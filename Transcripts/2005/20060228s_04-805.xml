            <text syncTime="10.574" offset="130745">These cases come to us on writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.119" offset="156972">Petitioners Texaco and Shell Oil collaborated in a joint venture called Equilon Enterprises, Inc. to refine and sell gasoline to the western United States and to do so under the original Texaco and Shell Oil brand names.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.549" offset="230637">Respondents, a class of Texaco and Shell Oil service-station owners, alleged that petitioners engaged in unlawful price-fixing when Equilon set a single price for both Texaco and Shell Oil-brand gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.743" offset="299496">The Court of Appeals held that this pricing practice was per se illegal under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.575" offset="326768">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.833" offset="347770">It is not per se illegal under Section 1 of the Sherman Act for a lawful, economically integrated joint venture to set the prices at which it sells its products.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.645" offset="399075">Under our precedents, per se liability is reserved for those agreements that are so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.901" offset="456126">Price-fixing agreements between two or more competitors, known as horizontal price-fixing agreements, fall into the category of arrangements that are per se unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.790" offset="499594">We are not presented with such an agreement here, however, because Texaco and Shell Oil did not compete with one another in the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.374" offset="533971">Instead, they participated in that market jointly through their investment in Equilon.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.544" offset="558631">Throughout Equilon’s existence, Texaco and Shell Oil shared in the profits of Equilon’s activities in their role as investors, not competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.280" offset="601576">The Court of Appeals erred when it imposed per se liability by invoking the ancillary restraints doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.635" offset="631042">That doctrine governs the validity of restrictions imposed by illegitimate joint venture or non-venture activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.299" offset="665628">Here, by contrast, the challenged business practice involves the core activity of the joint venture itself; that is, the pricing of the goods produced and sold by Equilon.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.390" offset="714007">The decision of the Court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.192" offset="725292">Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</text>
