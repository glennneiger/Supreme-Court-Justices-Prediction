            <text syncTime="10.824" offset="201597">The Solomon Amendment conditions the Federal funding of educational institutions on receiving something that any donor would expect, the opportunity to recruit students educated at the funded institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.192" offset="259066">That opportunity allows the military a fair shot at recruiting the best and the brightest for the military's critical and vital mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.589" offset="292607">The Federal Government does not insist on any predetermined level of access; rather, it simply asks what other employers receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.497" offset="328238">Likewise, the recipient schools remain free to criticize the military and its policies, and, of course, they remain free to decline Federal funds altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.584" offset="372647">As a result of these circumstances, the Solomon Amendment comports with both the Constitution and with common sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="61.398" offset="403889">When you say that it asks what other employers receive, but these institutions, I gather, would not allow other employers, who have the same policy against the hiring of homosexuals, to interview at their institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.703" offset="473061">So, you're receiving what other employers in the same situation would receive.</text>

            <text syncTime="84.580" offset="496571">Well, I think, Justice Scalia, that you have to look at the... I think, the statute in two steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.956" offset="518096">One is, I think it's quite clear that it gives the military a right to gain access to campus as a condition, that it has... that they have to gain access to campus in order to perform their military recruitment.</text>

            <text syncTime="107.417" offset="588000">Now, every other employer is subject to the same policy, presumably, of the law school.</text>

            <text syncTime="112.876" offset="609838">Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, I think there's several points to be made in response to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.158" offset="626870">First of all, I think the Solomon Amendment itself is a recognition that the military is not like any other employer for purposes of its policy and its treatments of homosexuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.149" offset="666890">And I think that, unlike any other employer, the military's policy is a result of a congressional mandate.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.349" offset="731674">--Well, and Justice Kennedy, I think the point I would say is, in terms of gaining access to campus, we want to gain access at a level, and under circumstances, that perhaps some other employer would be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.351" offset="775664">Well, once access is gained, then the question arose under the prior version of the statute, all right, if access is gained, what level of access suffices?</text>
            <text syncTime="163.693" offset="813071">And on that second order question of what level of access suffices, then you look to what is provided to any other employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.396" offset="839820">And so, that's why, when I say that we don't ask for any predetermined level, we don't ask for seven meetings a year, we don't ask for entrance into the public address system or the email system.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.420" offset="891961">We simply say,</text>
            <text syncTime="184.003" offset="894260">"Once you let us on campus, just give us, and extend to us, an opportunity to recruit on the same terms as others. "</text>
            <text syncTime="189.962" offset="918083">And that obviously reflects the commonsense judgment that the military is competing for the same pool of students that the other employers are competing for.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.744" offset="1149215">The statute doesn't require simply giving the same access that you give to other employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.120" offset="1170740">It requires much more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.975" offset="1178158">It requires that they... it prohibits, or cuts off, funds if an institution either prohibits or, in effect, prevents the Secretary of a military department from gaining access to campuses for purposes of military recruiting in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.627" offset="1296754">So, it seems to me that the statute demands more than simply you give the same access as all other employers.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.486" offset="1396229">And, really, the statute was not about homosexuals in the military, it was a statute about universities in Vietnam not letting military people on campus.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.886" offset="1473865">So, why not interpret the statute in the way that the amicus brief suggests in order to avoid a difficult constitutional question?</text>

            <text syncTime="339.722" offset="1517123">I don't think there is a difficult constitutional question to be avoided here, and I'll get back to that whenever I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.848" offset="1537708">As to the statutory interpretation question itself, I think that in... the proper frame of reference here is probably not the original 1969 version of this, which conditioned only NASA's fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.778" offset="1585355">The original starting point is probably about 1996, when the first version of the modern Solomon Amendment was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.331" offset="1611582">And there have been a couple of iterations of it, but I think one important reference point is the version that was in force at the start of this litigation, and that's actually reproduced at page 88(a) of the petition appendix in the District Court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.949" offset="1670096">And if you look at that against 88(a) of the petition appendix, there would be no question that what is at stake here is access to the campus, and the amicus argument that's being raised is not even available; because the statute at that point is, I think, in fairness, materially identical, except for that last clause, which says</text>
            <text syncTime="397.599" offset="1748673">"in a manner equal in scope to... in character to that of any other institution. "</text>
            <text syncTime="402.975" offset="1770198">So, it's clear that when this litigation starts, there's no argument available to the amicus that the statute effectively accomplishes nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="647.213" offset="2747177">I think, in answering your question, we tended to focus on the fact that it was a spending condition, because we thought, under this Court's precedence, that made it an even more straightforward case.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.610" offset="2780718">We certainly think it would be constitutional, even if it were a direct imposition, and we certainly think the fact that this is an exercise of Congress's undoubted authority to raise and support an army, is relevant to the constitutional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.895" offset="2837874">And if I could move over to the constitutional question and address that for a minute, I think one of the arguments that's raised on the other side is that there's an interference with associational interests in this case, and I think there are other statutes that, frankly, have much more of an interference with a university's associational interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.544" offset="2912480">I mean, Title VII, for example, regulates who can be members of the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.410" offset="2927945">And I raise that also because another provision in Title... in terms of this same area of the military, requires that there not be discrimination against veterans in hiring and employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.947" offset="3242041">For example, NYU... this is in the joint appendix, at page 153... NYU, for 3 years, had a policy of excluding recruiters from the State of Colorado, simply because Colorado had passed Amendment II, which this Court dealt with in the Romer case.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.724" offset="3385192">I also think, with respect to the issue of discrimination, it's worth pointing out here that there's more than one way to understand whether or not the military's policy is discriminatory.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="3367.395" offset="13627909">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.792" offset="13661450">I'd like to make just a few points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.469" offset="13668137">First of all, in starting with the compelled speech problem, there are only two kinds of speech that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.030" offset="13690394">First, there is the compelled speech of the military recruiters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.218" offset="13703141">And no one thinks that that speech is being misattributed to the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.600" offset="13720696">Even in the secondary school context, in Mergens, this Court understood that secondary students could distinguish between the school's message and that of school groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.408" offset="13755909">Now, the second piece of speech that's at issue is that of the university, when they incidentally send an email around telling the students where the military recruiters are going to be on a certain day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.411" offset="13799899">And certainly in the context of recruiting, that kind of incidental speech does not implicate any compelled speech doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.641" offset="13832813">In the Title VII context, for example, if an employer says that there's a job opening, and says that to a white applicant, it has to say the same thing to an African American applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.060" offset="13874505">Nobody would think that that other... saying that to the African American applicant, which is, of course, compelled speech by Title VII, violates the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.375" offset="13907837">I would also say, just as the last point on compelled speech, that it's something of a stranger in a strange land in the context of this case, since we are talking about a funding condition, not a compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.544" offset="13948483">Second, let me move to the argument that the Respondents have about trying to distinguish this case from Justice Stevens' World War II hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.608" offset="13980666">And, as I understand it, it boils down to the argument that the way that the legislature was reacting here to this problem and observing what it observed on campus somehow implicates different constitutional issues, different first amendment issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.132" offset="14034792">And I think the O'Brien case stands as an obstacle to that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.670" offset="14049002">In that case, if you look at it, the argument was exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.868" offset="14065721">There already was a prohibition that required you to have your draft card with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.067" offset="14082544">Congress then passed a second statute that prohibited burning your draft card.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.349" offset="14099680">Now, what did the Representatives say about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.359" offset="14107726">Well, Representative Bray, of Indiana, said that this was an effort to get at "communist stooges and beatniks".</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.819" offset="14129564">Now, this Court did not strike the statute down on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.090" offset="14142625">It looked at the text of the statute and upheld the statute as a reasonable statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.372" offset="14159762">Let me also, then, move to what you could call the "Bob Jones problem".</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.248" offset="14179301">And I think you have to have be cautious about interpreting this statute in applying a rule and having it come back in the context of other statutes that even the law schools like, like Title VI and Title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.168" offset="14222978">I don't think it's enough to simply say that race is going to be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.866" offset="14237711">For one thing, Federal statutes also prohibit, as a condition on funding, universitywide discrimination on the basis of disability and on the basis of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.441" offset="14276059">Now, those aren't things that trigger heightened scrutiny, and I think one has to be worried about converting this rule in this case to something that's going to threaten those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.516" offset="14312317">This Court, in Hishon, for example, made the point that all discrimination can be recharacterized as somebody simply saying... exercising their associational rights,</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.008" offset="14350351">"I don't want to associate with you, because you're female. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.935" offset="14357979">in Hishon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.863" offset="14361740">You have to be leery of that kind of recharacterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.884" offset="14373861">The last point I would make is that there's simply no limit on Respondent's argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.277" offset="14395386">I don't think their matter of conscious limitation is going to be enforceable by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.219" offset="14415135">And, beyond that, I think, even in this case, there is more at issue here than just the military's policy on homosexuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.189" offset="14443034">If you look at the original statement of the American Association of Law Schools... which is in the joint appendix at 246 and 249... they were concerned, first and foremost, about the military's policies on homosexuals, but also about the discrimination in sex, on what kind of combat roles that women could have, what they call career advancing positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.934" offset="14522028">So, even if Congress changed "don't ask, don't tell" tomorrow, the... presumably, the law schools would still be here protesting the military's position on gender, or perhaps the war in Iraq, or perhaps the war in Afghanistan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.696" offset="14573019">And the last point in showing there is no limits on their position is, as Justice Kennedy pointed out, any conduct can be imbued with communicative force just by saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.689" offset="14609068">"We're opposed to this, and, therefore, we're going to engage in this conduct. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.471" offset="14624219">That's simply not enough to generate a significant first amendment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.009" offset="14638325">Thank you.</text>
