            <text syncTime="9.507" offset="126612">This case concerns the distinction between sometimes confused concepts, federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction and the essential ingredients of a federal claim for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.461" offset="186484">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate, among other grounds, on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.329" offset="237998">To spare very small businesses from liability, Congress confined the definition of “employer” to those having 15 or more employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.506" offset="286690">The question presented: does this numerical qualification affect federal-court subject-matter jurisdiction or instead delineate a substantive ingredient of a Title VII claim for relief?</text>
            <text syncTime="66.070" offset="352937">The question arises in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.402" offset="366207">Jennifer Arbaugh brought a Title VII action in federal court against her former employer, Y &amp; H Corporation, charging sexual harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.528" offset="422736">A jury trial yielded a $40,000 verdict for Arbaugh.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.270" offset="453665">Two weeks after the trial court entered judgment on the jury’s verdict, Y &amp; H moved to dismiss the entire action for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.388" offset="502148">For the first time in the litigation, Y &amp; H asserted that it had fewer than 15 employees and, therefore, was not amenable to suit under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.223" offset="545511">A trial judge found it a close question, but determined that Y &amp; H’s employees numbered below 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.509" offset="578635">She thought it unfair and a waste of judicial resource to dismiss a fully tried suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.720" offset="607474">Nevertheless, she considered herself bound to do so, because she believed that the 15-or-more-employee requirement was jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.901" offset="648225">The Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed the dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.074" offset="668914">We reject the lower court’s categorization of the employee-numerosity requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.155" offset="697231">If Congress clearly provides that a threshold limitation on a statute scope shall count as jurisdictional, that designation will control, and courts and litigants will not be left to wrestle with the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.057" offset="760865">But when Congress does not write a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.217" offset="809453">Applying that bright line to this case, we hold that the threshold number of employees for application of Title VII is an element of plaintiff’s claim for relief, not a jurisdictional matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.450" offset="866400">Title VII defines the term “employer” in a provision that does not speak in jurisdictional terms, nor does that definitional provision reference Title VII’s own jurisdictional prescription, or 28 U.S.C §1331, which gives federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under the laws of the United States, including Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.357" offset="982070">Because the employee-numerosity requirement as we hold today relates to the substantive adequacy of Arbaugh’s Title VII claim, Y &amp; H could not raise the issue defensively after it had failed to assert any objection on this ground prior to the close of trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.941" offset="1076424">The decision reversing the 5th Circuit judgment is unanimous; Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
