            <text syncTime="11.894" offset="199959">In this case, the Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit held that a decision to unify the prices charged for the two branded gasoline products sold by a joint venture created by Shell and Texaco could be deemed a per se violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.754" offset="267355">The Ninth Circuit's decision is plainly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.802" offset="279580">A joint venture has to be able to and is entitled to create and set the prices for the products that it sells.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="39.123" offset="308837">Mr. Nager, on... on that point, I have a factual question and I figured I'd get it... excuse me... get it out on the table at the beginning so you'd know what at least is bothering me.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.551" offset="346558">The nub... the nub of your factual argument is, as you just... just stated it, there's a joint venture here and joint ventures price their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.713" offset="387205">The factual question that I have is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.755" offset="403400">This is... or the preface for it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.904" offset="415939">This is a joint venture that has continued to market, in effect, the same product that the... that the two companies marketed beforehand, and it has done so, ostensibly, under the old brand names.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.620" offset="478842">Therefore, the fact that there is a joint venture doesn't necessarily disclose that there is a new product as... as might be the case normally which you would expect the joint venture to set its own price for.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.372" offset="545820">Therefore, it seems to me that if the joint venture is clearly going to cover pricing, the joint venture agreements, the documents that indicated the joint venture at the beginning, should have mentioned pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.321" offset="613634">And yet, my understanding is that they did not do so, and in fact, the claim on the other side, as I recall the briefs, is that when the Government looked at the joint venture, prior to its going into effect, nothing was said about fixing prices... setting prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.419" offset="690016">So my question is, did the joint venture, as indicated by documentation, say in any... so many words that the joint venture is going to set prices for these two... or for the... the... whatever it... whatever it sells?</text>
            <text syncTime="153.316" offset="765667">And... and number two, if... if the answer to that is no, should we regard the joint venture as covering pricing?</text>

            <label>Mr. Glen D. Nager</label>
            <text syncTime="172.681" offset="843094">I think it is undeniable... and Mr. Minear can speak on behalf of the FTC to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.958" offset="868171">I think it is undisputed that the Government understood that this joint venture was a consolidation of both the refining assets of the two companies, as well as the marketing functions of the two companies, and that it would own the gasoline and it would decide how to sell it and what price to sell it at.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.572" offset="950614">I don't--</text>

            <text syncTime="203.332" offset="965660">--I don't know off the top of my head, Justice Souter, whether there's a specific document that says marketing includes pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.403" offset="993977">But I don't think that anyone had any doubt that this included pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.504" offset="1010382">And indeed, the respondents, of course, in bringing their challenge, haven't framed this as a challenge to the ability and right of the joint venture to set its prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.801" offset="1047580">What they've challenged is the subsequent decision that was made to sell the Texaco branded Equilon gasoline and the Shell branded Equilon gasoline at the same price.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="235.204" offset="1093138">Well, taking that point just a bit further, your reply brief... the reply brief for... for Shell says that the respondent has conceded that the pricing decision to sell at the same price was not made till 8 months afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.291" offset="1169520">I'm not sure that that's quite a fair statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.063" offset="1184566">That isn't inconsistent with its suggestion that there might have been an agreement even before the joint venture to have single pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.302" offset="1225526">They just waited until 8 months to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.747" offset="1231378">So I'm not sure that your yellow brief correctly characterized their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.261" offset="1249454">Tell me if I'm wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.132" offset="1252903">Well, I... I think that that's a... a fair interpretation of one possible understanding of their brief, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.094" offset="1284772">I don't think that it matters for this Court in deciding this case whether there was discussions by the owners of the joint venture earlier than the time of September of 1998 whether they were going to unify the prices or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.498" offset="1342346">The... the important point for this Court is that this was an efficiency enhancing joint venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.215" offset="1365229">The Ninth Circuit didn't question that.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.969" offset="1372230">And that in an efficiency enhancing joint venture, it is entitled to set the prices of its product, whether it decides to do it 8 months after the venture is in operation or 2 months before, as long as what they're doing is setting the prices of the products of the venture itself.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>

            <text syncTime="321.017" offset="1436387">That's why... really it's a question for Mr. Alioto, but I want to know chapter and verse citations.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.360" offset="1453836">Pan Am and Grace meet before they set up Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.545" offset="1474525">Of course, they talk about price.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.951" offset="1484138">But what do they say?</text>
            <text syncTime="334.377" offset="1489885">Suppose what they say is you, Panagra, have the power to set price.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.084" offset="1512664">Normal.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.755" offset="1515381">You, Panagra, have the power to set price but never below $14 a ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.623" offset="1542862">That wouldn't be normal.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.140" offset="1548922">What are they trying to do there?</text>
            <text syncTime="350.914" offset="1556027">They're trying to protect Grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.079" offset="1564700">So I think a lot would depend on what they said in the preliminary meeting, and of course, what I want to know is this is a summary judgment motion where, as the other side pointed to particular conversations that they made which would say it's more like the second than the first.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.714" offset="1627185">Well, what I can say to that, Justice Breyer, is our opponents have repeatedly pointed out in their briefs deposition testimony that the parties refused to discuss price with each other before they had an actual memorandum of understanding out of concerns about the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.337" offset="1725719">But what... what the court below pointed to was conversations that took place in the spring of 1998 about a strategic marketing initiative.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.359" offset="1765843">And this is after the formation of Equilon, after Equilon was operational.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.842" offset="1783711">And at that point, all you conceivably have at that point with the owners of Equilon having left the market is Equilon subject to the direction of its owners setting the prices for its products, and it could sell them as Shell gasoline, it could sell them as Texaco gasoline, it could choose to sell them as something else.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.770" offset="1967404">Once the joint venture existed, Equilon had its own marketing strategy, and Motiva, the other joint venturer, had its own marketing strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.896" offset="2003975">The... the role of the owners at that point was on a members committee, which... as a typical board of directors where the... each CEO of each joint venture had to present a business plan and obtain approval by the owners of the... of the joint ventures for the upcoming year.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.524" offset="2350463">They did do business in other countries around the world, selling branded gasoline, unbranded gasoline, and other petroleum products.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.117" offset="14176827">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.326" offset="14189680">I have three quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.229" offset="14193232">One, just to bring us back to the stipulated facts of this case, I'd ask the Court to check the joint appendix, page 78 to 79, stipulated fact number 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.442" offset="14238163">The second sentence of that stipulation says, after the formation of Equilon and Motiva, the pricing was consolidated so that one person at Equilon set prices for both the Shell and Texaco brands in any given Equilon pricing area, and one person at Motiva set prices for both brands in any given Motiva pricing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.094" offset="14320710">There's never been any allegation in this case that Shell and Texaco set the actual prices at which this gasoline was sold at.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.944" offset="14348191">The only claim then that the owners of the joint venture said that the prices had to be the same between the two branded names in any given area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.708" offset="14391240">Secondly, with respect to the 8 month period that the respondents keep pointing to, the record reflects testimony that, as with any consolidation of two businesses that have been separate and are coming together, it took them a few months to figure out how to consolidate and unify and save the $800 million a year that was the purpose of this joint venture in consolidating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.034" offset="14496462">No... no two companies, when they create a joint venture or merge, instantaneously are able to operate as if they didn't previously exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.950" offset="14532197">It takes a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.693" offset="14535123">And the third point... and this is the point that Justice Breyer has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.132" offset="14548916">When this joint venture was created, it eliminated competition in the United States for branded gasoline between Shell and Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.253" offset="14589353">That's a stipulated fact in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.869" offset="14599802">And when it eliminated competition between Shell and Texaco, there was no further competition to effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.040" offset="14628537">There was no further anticompetitive consequence that could happen from the pricing of the gasoline of that joint venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.511" offset="14658421">It's your three counters in the department store.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.937" offset="14676080">And if there is no further anticompetitive effect that can happen, there's no quick look reason possible, Justice Souter, for the issue that's been challenged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.932" offset="14712129">Your hypothetical goes to the formation which they waived.</text>
