            <text syncTime="566.211" offset="2412710">In 1950, Congress passed a reinstatement provision that said that for the specified aliens... and it was only a subgroup... if they were deported and reentered, they would be... that their previous deportation order would be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.420" offset="2477494">The INS... and that statute's quoted in page 2 of the Government's brief... the INS interpreted that statute as applying only prospectively, and only applying to an alien who was deported, and, therefore, obviously reinstated... reentering after the effective date of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.902" offset="2547502">Now, in 1952, Congress, evidently dissatisfied with an interpretation... with a reinstatement provision that was only prospective, added the "before or after" language to the reinstatement provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1729.940" offset="7067626">Section 1231(a)(5) aims to streamline the removal of aliens who were already removed but have since illegally reentered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.813" offset="7099078">The Congress that enacted IIRIRA did not intend to grandfather the provision and exempt those aliens who are already in the country illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.786" offset="7126976">Rather, the focus on streamlining the rules for getting illegal reentrants out of the country is fully applicable, and, indeed, is especially applicable to illegal reentrants who were already in the country at the time of IIRIRA's enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.763" offset="7178908">Three considerations, I think, point to the conclusion that Section 1231(a)(5) is addressed to removing illegal reentrants from the country, including aliens who are already in the country, and that the provision is not so much addressed to the antecedent act of illegal reentry, as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.861" offset="7243274">The first consideration I would point to is the operation of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.623" offset="7258320">And it's useful to bear in mind the following possible scenario in which a person, who's been removed, illegally reenters the country, but then returns to his home country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1958.754" offset="7982852">Now, another consideration that I think indicates that Section 1231(a)(5) is focused on the timing of the removal, as opposed to the timing of reentry, is to take into account Section 1231(a)(5) in the context of Section 1231 as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.369" offset="8041367">Section 1231 was a new provision that was enacted by IIRIRA, and Congress entitled it, quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="1981.572" offset="8074176">close quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.424" offset="8077520">And, as its title indicates, the provisions in Section 1231, like 1231(a)(5), all pertain to executing an order of removal against an alien who's been ordered removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.236" offset="8120779">For example, those provisions concern the time period within which somebody is to be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.272" offset="8140945">They address the travel of somebody to the removal destination, the identification of the countries to which they may be removed, the payment of expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.638" offset="8178353">But all of them address the execution of an order of removal in the same way that Section 1231(a)(5) does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.298" offset="8204998">Section 1231(a)(5) speaks to the execution of the preexisting order of removal, the one that the alien had in place when he illegally reentered the country, but it's of a piece with those other provisions, in the sense that it, like them, addresses the timing of removal rather than speaking to the act of illegal reentry, as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.821" offset="8275110">The third consideration, I think, that points to the same conclusion, which is that Congress was focused prospectively on removals that postdated IIRIRA, rather than retrospectively, in some sense, on acts of illegal reentry that predated IIRIRA, is that at the time of illegal reentry, as we explain in... at length in our brief, an alien would have had no eligibility, as a categorical matter, and at least as a practical matter, for the three types of relief that Petitioner invokes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.966" offset="8387750">And those three types of relief are adjustment of status, suspension of deportation, and voluntary departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.301" offset="8409066">Now, with respect to adjustment of status, as the colloquy earlier indicated, at the time that Petitioner illegally reentered the country in 1981, up until 1994, which was just 2 years before IIRIRA, adjustment of status was categorically unavailable to illegal entrants and illegal reentrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.146" offset="8468416">In that light, it's... one would be hard pressed to assert that an illegal reentrant would have performed that act in reasonable reliance on the availability of adjustment of status.</text>

            <text syncTime="2780.060" offset="11268116">So, in some sense, sending them back out of the country puts them in the same position that they would have been in under the old removal order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.920" offset="11295492">And so, insofar as it has that effect on them, I think it's different than a $50 penalty that attaches to the primary conduct of illegal reentry, as such.</text>

            <text syncTime="2812.688" offset="11398624">--the idea was... I think what the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize was that adjustment of status was categorically unavailable to somebody who illegally reentered before IIRIRA, at least before 1994.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.931" offset="11443554">And what Judge McConnell presumed was that it would have been available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.649" offset="11454421">And his point was that even if it would have been available, it's farfetched to think that somebody would have thought not only about coming into the country, but coming into the country and then meeting a United States citizen, and become married to the United States citizen, and using that as sort of a reliance basis for not applying the law retroactively to somebody who had come in beforehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.686" offset="11530594">But I think that was based on a misimpression about the availability of adjustment of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.638" offset="11546372">Now, I'd like to address, briefly, if I could, the argument at step one of the Landgraf inquiry concerning the negative inference the Petitioner seeks to draw from the "before or after" clause... so called "before or after" clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.076" offset="11600185">And the two provisions can be compared side by side at pages 2 and 3 of the Government's brief, and that's in the body of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.966" offset="11627665">The fundamental flaw with the argument at step one is that the 2, referred, by terms, to the date of the INA's enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.931" offset="11675522">Now, what we've reflected is the codified version, which refers specifically to the date of June 27 of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.070" offset="11700077">But even the INA itself referred to the date of the enactment of this Act, which can only be seen to refer to the INA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.545" offset="11734036">So, if this language had been carried forward in Section 1231(a)(5), it still would have been a reference to the date of the enactment of the INA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.739" offset="11766846">So, it would refer to somebody who was deported before or after 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.264" offset="11784923">Now, I think, as Justice Alito suggested, the probable reason that Congress decided not to carry forward this language is because the question of whether someone was deported before or after 1952 doesn't have a great deal of practical significance at this point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.259" offset="11844900">But whatever one might think was the actual reason for Congress's failing to carry forward the language, I don't think that you can draw any negative inference from Congress's failure to carry forward that language, at least certainly not the negative inference that Petitioner wants to draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.572" offset="11902160">In fact, the negative inference that one would draw, if one were going to do so, is that the Section 1231(a)(5) applies only to people who were deported initially after 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.658" offset="11950434">But that sort of negative inference wouldn't be of much assistance to Petitioner, or any other person, for that matter, that illegally reentered before IIRIRA, at least as a practical matter, because everybody, I think, in that category, would have illegally reentered... or would have been deported after 1952--</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.926" offset="12399532">The first is that illegal reentrants' reasonable expectation that they might grow into relief, as Mr.... the Chief Justice said, not only is reasonable, but has a statutory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.647" offset="12466405">Suspension of deportation and cancellation of removal, by their very terms, are only available to aliens who were illegally present in the United States for the relevant time period, and, therefore, these forms of relief specifically exist to... for such aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.560" offset="12538085">That people have a reasonable reliance interest in unlawful acts over time is also demonstrated by such doctrines as the doctrine of adverse possession, statutes of limitations/laches, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="3120.148" offset="12628469">That's 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(6)(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.481" offset="12645814">Because he had reentered the country within 5 years of his 1981 deportation, he... under the Government's interpretation of that statute, he would be inadmissible for 5 years from... even if he were to releave in 1996, he would have been ineligible to reenter for 5 years.</text>
