            <text syncTime="923.157" offset="3841423">Your Honor, I answered that because, as Justice Scalia changed the hypothetical, it was not an employee benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.161" offset="3873501">It was the employer insuring itself, buying an annuity or, like we have here, insuring itself, so it... so it could make the payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.369" offset="3914252">What we have here, Your Honor, is a situation where, as is admitted in the record, the employees don't benefit at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.207" offset="3945599">As Zurich has admitted in this record at page 17, the employees are in the same position whether there is insurance or no insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.330" offset="3986141">In fact, the irony here is that if Zurich prevails, not only do the employees not benefit, they are harmed because there are in the (a)(4)... the (a)(4) priority claimants are a total of 1.6 million, including the 400,000 of Zurich.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.876" offset="4060329">All the others are health and welfare funds such as Justice Breyer was... was posing.</text>

            <text syncTime="985.982" offset="4092721">But what happens... and there's not enough money to pay everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.700" offset="4107558">What happens is if the Zurich Insurance Company receivable gets an equal priority with the health and welfare funds, then there is a dilution of the money going for the employees' health and welfare and pension, a 25 percent, in this case, dilution of that money because the employer chose to insure itself for its liability, potential liability, to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.302" offset="4226050">The employer benefitted from that insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.004" offset="4240783">In some States, it would be required to have the insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.789" offset="4251963">In most States, it has the option of having insurance or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2314.216" offset="9405714">I think in the overwhelming majority of instances, the contributions employers make to employee benefit plans is the payment of insurance premiums to secure the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.072" offset="9441136">Collectively bargained benefits provided by union trusts are a small minority of the benefits that are provided to workers in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.058" offset="9465064">But... but going back to the specific question, of course, as Justice Alito's question earlier suggested, in a multi employer pension plan situation, the plan is obligated by law to provide all vested pension benefits whether or not the employee's employer has defaulted on its payments into the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.937" offset="9536535">So it's in exactly the same position as the insurance company is with respect to that set of benefits, and therefore, the argument doesn't draw a distinction between the two.</text>

            <text syncTime="2625.422" offset="10650500">I think there are two significant points there, Justice Ginsburg, in terms of the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.790" offset="10663980">First, in 1934 what Congress said was that workers' compensation could be a provable claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.194" offset="10693550">It then said it's... it gets the... the seventh priority, but the seventh priority was not a priority specific to workers' compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.014" offset="10724897">It was a priority that's... it was a provision that said you get a priority if State law provides the priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.002" offset="10744855">In 1938, what Congress did was wipe out that provision for all State law granted priorities, not for workers' comp in specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.506" offset="10774843">So it doesn't seem to me it was a specific judgment about workers' comp and its place in the priority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.892" offset="10792398">And, of course, you didn't have the well developed system of employee benefit plans in the 1930's that you have now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.296" offset="10814027">And what Congress did, when it enacted this provision in 1978, following closely after ERISA, was to use language which is identical to ERISA in providing a priority for employee benefit plans which, as ERISA on its face, I think, makes clear, would encompass workers' compensation plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="2716.812" offset="11016006">Congress just took the aggregate amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.912" offset="11024469">It seems to me just an elegant solution that protects the wage priority above, creates a new priority, and doesn't disadvantage any of the... any of the priority holders below.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.418" offset="11490494">I also think that if the Court does look at the legislative history, what... what one learns from the legislative history is that when the bill was originally introduced to... to create this priority, it created a priority for... proposed to create a priority for pensions, insurance, and similar employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.963" offset="11564682">The union representatives came in to Congress and said that's too narrow.</text>

            <text syncTime="2970.168" offset="12029452">--Well, depending on the kind of policy, that may be true to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.285" offset="12037916">Sometimes policies are loss sensitive policies in which the amounts owed are calculated very carefully with respect to the amounts actually of loss incurred during the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.677" offset="12083474">That is, in fact, the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.529" offset="12090892">If you have an understanding of insurance, you can infer that from the charts that are included in the joint appendix, although I acknowledge it's very difficult to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.783" offset="12119940">So I do think... I do think on any common sense understanding of the... of the phrase, arising from, which is a capacious phrase, it really does arise from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.789" offset="12151914">But in terms of... I think, Justice Stevens, with respect to your question, to get to the same answer, in terms of calculating the amount of the claim, whichever one you pick here, there's actually a division of authority in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.228" offset="12193710">There's a Fourth Circuit opinion by Judge Luttig, saying it's services rendered by the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.214" offset="12217638">Other courts say services rendered the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.083" offset="12225162">Since it doesn't make a difference in this case, I would respectfully suggest probably it ought not to be decided in this case because you get to the same place either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.856" offset="12260270">I do... I do think that it's important also... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.260" offset="12281795">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.976" offset="12284721">If I may just go back to the narrow construction rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.212" offset="12293602">The... the point of this idea of primacy of equality of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.930" offset="12312515">Equality of distribution is an important policy under the bankruptcy code, but it's only one important policy under the bankruptcy code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.270" offset="12345847">Rehabilitation of the debtor is an important policy under the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.305" offset="12358073">The maximizing the value of the estate is an important policy under the code, and specific code provisions advance other specific policies as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.677" offset="12391509">So in any given case, as here, all of those copolicies aren't going to align and point in the same direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.414" offset="12418468">Sometimes they're going to be at cross purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.699" offset="12427558">And what... what the Court said in Union Bank, in I think a closely analogous context interpreting the ordinary course exemption from... from the preference rule, was that we don't put a thumb on the scale either way here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.693" offset="12479594">We don't assume that one of these policies is more important than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.143" offset="12489416">What we assume is that Congress struck the balance between the potentially competing policies, that the balance is reflected in the text of the statute that Congress enacted, and that we should interpret the text as it's written without... without a presumption in either direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.903" offset="12552424">I really think Union Bank is highly instructive on that, and it's just... it's just right and plain common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.139" offset="12573322">And that's why I think in the vast majority of cases, there is no rule of narrow construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.793" offset="12603937">Those two I think of as those are law mandated coverage that every employer must have, workers' comp and unemployment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.101" offset="12649181">No, because the employer doesn't have the obligation to provide unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.688" offset="12667571">That's a State run system in which the State has the obligation to provide the benefit, and the State does in fact provide the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.240" offset="12689723">It's usually funded through a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.675" offset="12695470">The key difference is this is an employer obligation to provide these benefits, and I think that's why this is an employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.329" offset="12722115">The employer is obligated to provide it to employees by virtue of the fact that the employees are working for the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.650" offset="12743431">Not true about unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.034" offset="12752940">In conclusion, if I could just focus on the... the point that it really is the case that enforcing this priority, as it is written, will advance the purposes for which Congress included it in the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.777" offset="12819918">It will protect the interests of workers, millions of whom have no employee benefit plan other than workers' compensation, because it will increase the prospects that that money is there to pay workers' compensation claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.573" offset="12883134">It will also advance the code's purpose of better rehabilitation because it will give insurance companies a reason not to pull the hair trigger, to hang in there with these companies, and to allow them to have a chance rehabilitate rather than forcing them into liquidation by canceling coverage which the law allows.</text>

            <text syncTime="3239.759" offset="13107891">It is simply improper to do that, and yet, that is the answer given by Zurich to the many probing hypotheticals about parking lots and bottled water and the rest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3262.589" offset="13199111">And they're saying here's an example of where Congress put the workers' comp on the same side as the health benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.342" offset="13222203">Now, that's their approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="3316.021" offset="13412897">And I... I suggest to the Court that when we look to the legislative history, as the questions were asked about the legislative history, it is the void of any reference to the commission that recommended the law, the House report or the Senate report, or even one stray Congressperson suggesting that workers' comp insurance policies should get a priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.204" offset="13517596">Not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.938" offset="13520522">The industry didn't even put up a representative to make that suggestion at a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3377.960" offset="13660642">The issue is what is the Court's proper approach to this attempt to enlarge the priority under subsection (a)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.816" offset="13700035">It is not correct that this Court departs from the idea that priorities are a deviation from the bedrock principle of equality of... equality of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.242" offset="13757818">That remains good law, cited by this Court a number of times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.646" offset="13779343">The cases they purportedly cite to the contrary were plain language cases, were Embassy Restaurant and Joint Industries Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.134" offset="13809331">This Court didn't even feel necessary to cite that principle because of the... because of the plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.370" offset="13834305">Where is the plain language establishing clearly, as this Court requires, that this is a plan?</text>
