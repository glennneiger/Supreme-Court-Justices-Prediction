            <text syncTime="8.897" offset="182051">This Court has never held that a specific method of weighing aggravating and mitigating evidence is required, yet in its individualized sentencing line of cases this Court has consistently said that all the eighth amendment requires is that a juror consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.047" offset="254671">In pages 23 through 28 of your appendix, you will find that Kansas jury instructions and Kansas law clearly, on four occasions, instruct individual jurors that they must individually consider all mitigating evidence that they find.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.348" offset="315902">Furthermore, the jurors are instructed in five different methods in which they can give that mitigating evidence the effect of a life sentence, and only one manner in which, acting unanimously and after the State has met the highest burden allowed by law in three separate measurements, beyond a reasonable doubt demonstrated that the death sentence is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.774" offset="413600">Specifically, instruction number 4, paragraph 2 on page 24 of the joint appendix, will show the jurors are instructed that mercy, in and of itself, is a mitigating piece of evidence, and later, in the instruction that lays out the mitigating evidence presented in this specific case, they are told, in paragraph 18 on page 26 of your joint appendix, that mercy, by itself, can be sufficient to warrant a sentence other than death.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.678" offset="6301182">Since the argument of the attorney general was addressed exclusively to the question of the constitutionality of the Kansas statute, I will devote all of my argument to that subject, as well, although I am sure that the Court, in deliberations, will be considering the several jurisdictional issues which were briefed and argued earlier in the term.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.911" offset="6466067">And at the selection stage, the question is whether the jury has made a reliable, collective, responsible decision based upon the unique circumstances of the individual defendant that death is an appropriate sentence and that this defendant is particularly culpable in a way that distinguishes him from the mass of death eligible defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.280" offset="6567631">And the problem with the equipoise provision here, which the State agrees can occur under the Kansas statute, is that we don't know from a death verdict pronounced by a jury in Kansas whether the jury did decree death by equipoise or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.314" offset="12447690">First, referring to Justice Scalia's question as it relates to other States that are affected, in the joint appendix, pages 98 through 107, you have a summary, and, additionally, in the amici brief that was filed by several States, on page 23, it identifies Arizona, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Missouri as having similar provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.752" offset="12537446">And, additionally, the cases that have relied on Walton to determine that the equipoise issue has been resolved are the Eleventh Circuit, in Jones v. Dugger, the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.081" offset="12582795">And in State v. Gretzler, they found that the provision provided for equipoise, as well as in Idaho, in State v. Hoffman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.207" offset="12607350">As it relates to a juror somehow imposing death when they are undecided, I would direct you to page 26 of the joint appendix, at instruction number 9, which reads,</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.471" offset="12652385">"The Defendant is entitled to the individual opinion of each juror. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.909" offset="12666073">"Each of you must consider the evidence for the purpose of reaching a verdict. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.124" offset="12683001">"Each of you must decide the case for yourself. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.390" offset="12696062">Furthermore, the jury is instructed, in instruction number 12 in the second paragraph on page 28 of the joint appendix, that,</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.037" offset="12730648">"In order to reach a verdict in the case, your decision must be unanimous. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.142" offset="12743082">"And then, after reasonable deliberation, if you are unable to reach a unanimous verdict, you shall notify the Court, and the result is a life sentence. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.251" offset="12779445">Kansas law is very clear that death is only appropriate in the singular instance in which a jury has found beyond a reasonable doubt with unanimity that the defendant is guilty of capital murder, that an aggravating factor exists, and then that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.467" offset="12852379">It was in 1994 that the Kansas Legislature passed the death penalty in Kansas, a few years after the Walton decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3186.952" offset="12894279">It was a compelling moment, not just because of the result, but the solemnity and seriousness of the debate in which they were seeking to define, through their reasoned moral judgment, what justice demands in instances such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.164" offset="12959167">And recognizing this Court as the final arbiter of the meaning of the eighth amendment, you will see, through pages 23 through 28 of your appendix, your words mirrored back to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.094" offset="13006815">The Legislature has respected your judgment and made the reasoned moral decision that death is appropriate in the instances--</text>
