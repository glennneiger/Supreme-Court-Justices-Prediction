            <text syncTime="9.188" offset="125085">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.937" offset="148073">Respondent Chatham County, Georgia -- Chatham County is where Savannah, Georgia is located, which for a variety of reasons is a notable city.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.366" offset="201780">Chatham County owns, operates and maintains a drawbridge over the Wilmington River.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.464" offset="226231">Petitioner Northern Insurance Company insured a boat that was damaged by the drawbridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.863" offset="255802">Petitioner filed suit in admiralty against respondent in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.772" offset="291433">Although respondent conceded that immunity under the Eleventh Amendment of United States Constitution does not extend to counties, it contented that it was nevertheless immune from the lawsuit under the, “universal rule of state immunity from suit without state’s consent”.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.874" offset="367815">Relying on circuit precedent, the District Court concluded that sovereign immunity extends to counties that, “exercise power delegated from the state”.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.325" offset="405640">On appeal, the 11th Circuit affirmed, relying on the same Circuit precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.154" offset="428941">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.737" offset="451302">Our cases have recognized that only states and arms of the state are entitled to immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.024" offset="476484">An entity qualifies as an arm of the state only if it satisfies the tests that we have applied in our sovereign-immunity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.023" offset="520474">There is no residual sovereign immunity that permits adoption of a broader test.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.468" offset="546179">The question on which we granted certiorari presumes, as the county concedes below, that the county is not an arm of the state under our sovereign-immunity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.022" offset="588497">That concession dictates our holding that the county is not entitled to sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.683" offset="611067">We also hold that there is no distinct sovereign immunity from in personam admiralty suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.705" offset="639175">We have historically applied the same immunity principles to admiralty cases as to other federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.422" offset="666029">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
