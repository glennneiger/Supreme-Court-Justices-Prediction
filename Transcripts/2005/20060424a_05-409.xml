            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="6.735" offset="179632">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.477" offset="190603">This case concerns the appealability of remand orders under the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, or SLUSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.526" offset="234802">Our position is that the general rule prohibiting appealability applies in this case for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.351" offset="266149">First, section 1447(d) has been consistently construed to prohibit appeal of remand orders based on a district court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.150" offset="321320">That rule governs even if the district court incorrectly construes a subject matter jurisdiction provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.057" offset="356951">Second, SLUSA section 77p(c) concededly defines removal jurisdiction and it does so by incorporating the criteria for preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.655" offset="419331">Thus, the court's subject matter jurisdiction is coextensive with those cases that SLUSA preempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.463" offset="458620">And third, Congress knows how to make remand orders appealable when it wants to, but SLUSA contains no provision for appellate review of remand orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.823" offset="512014">Under respondent's approach, the Federal courts would obtain jurisdiction in cases not subject to SLUSA preemption, but there's no indication that Congress intended that result.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="104.242" offset="569692">Under your approach, Mr. Frederick, the Federal court would decide the principal substantive issue in the case, the principal legal issue, nonfactual perhaps, and then decide that is has no jurisdiction if it finds that it doesn't come within... within (c), sends it back to the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.848" offset="668122">Is... is the State court bound by... by that finding by the Federal court?</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="135.484" offset="694662">Because under this Court's longstanding precedent, for there to be preclusion, there must be a right of appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.346" offset="722143">So if you agree that the general rule of 1447(d) applies and there is no right to appeal the remand order, then the basis on which that order is... is founded, the preemption of SLUSA is open for the State court to address on remand.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.940" offset="856517">The issue of preemption under SLUSA can be raised by the defendants on remand in the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.644" offset="883266">It can be litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.944" offset="888491">It's important to note that the removal provision says, shall be removable.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.778" offset="911792">It's at the defendants' discretion whether they want to ask the Federal court to test whether SLUSA preempts the case or to keep it in State court for the State court to apply SLUSA and thereby hold that the class action would be unsustainable.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.199" offset="1277506">Well, is... is there... correct me if I'm wrong, but I... I had thought there was an... an easier answer, and that is that the... the decision that ultimately the State court will make, as to whether there is or is not preclusion, is not identical to the decision that the Federal court... that the district court makes on the motion for remand because on the... and this is the way I was going about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.124" offset="1365173">On the motion for remand, all a Federal court decides is whether, in fact, there is a colorable basis for the removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.678" offset="1399446">When it goes back, if it does go back, to the State court, there will be an opportunity not to go merely to the stage of colorable basis, but to litigate it ultimately on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.698" offset="1451482">So... so that what we have is a... in effect, a kind of quick look finding at the Federal level, and that does not preclude a... a complete development of the issue on the merits in the State court, if that's where it goes.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.121" offset="1533193">I don't think that the SLUSA removal is analogous to the Federal officer removal statute where the statute itself says the defense has to be under color of law, and this Court in the Mesa v. California case said that phrase is where the colorable claim creates Article III jurisdiction.</text>
