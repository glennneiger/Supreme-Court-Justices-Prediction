            <text syncTime="9.658" offset="186701">In this case, the parties agree that Federal courts, including this Court, have addressed nonstatutory defenses for almost 200 years and that Congress, in enacting criminal law statutes, legislate against a background of Anglo Saxon common law, such that a defense of duress was likely contemplated by Congress when it passed the gun control statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.382" offset="273636">It is, therefore, required that courts apply defenses, such as the duress defense, based on the background principle of construction that the prosecution must prove criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.447" offset="325881">The Government would have this Court discount the development of over 110 years of common law that has produced a substantial, well established, well reasoned majority rule in both State and in Federal courts that places the burden on the Government to disprove the absence of duress once that defense has been raised by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.092" offset="408428">The development of the majority rule began with this Court's decision in Davis v. United States in 1895.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.904" offset="699746">The... the significant issue is that duress is based on the fact that there... that there must be free will, and if free will is dispensed with, in this case by duress, then the... the defendant doesn't have the requisite criminal intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.783" offset="767246">And... and in our... and since the beginning of... since before the beginning of common law in... in our system, it has been recognized that in order to have a criminal... a crime, there have to be two things, one, a vicious will and the other an act... an evil act concurrent with the vicious will.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.780" offset="2735207">And so like in... for instance, in Morissette, which was a theft case, what this Court did was the Congress had said knowingly didn't provide a... a criminal intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.985" offset="3052020">The Government... early on in this case, they searched Mrs. Dixon's apartment and found evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="734.846" offset="3087442">They actually interviewed the abusers prior to trial before we gave them notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.316" offset="3105310">They... they were able to investigate her background partially before we gave notice, partially afterwards, so that they were able to... to investigate her and circumstances of her life.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.834" offset="3159435">But not only that, they were able to call as witnesses the seven gun dealers from which the guns were purchased who witnessed the purchase and who did provide testimony that she did not appear to be under duress, and they so testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.556" offset="3210322">So in this particular case, it's really just like in the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.135" offset="3224637">You can certainly imagine a circumstance where that would be hard, but in very many cases, the facts are there just like a self defense case or, for that matter, just like--</text>
