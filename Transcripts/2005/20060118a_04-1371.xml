            <text syncTime="9.498" offset="189496">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="11.683" offset="198273">In an effort to limit State law securities class actions which undermine the market for nationally traded securities, Congress enacted SLUSA, a statute of broad preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.587" offset="253862">SLUSA, which is reprinted at page 8(a) of Petitioner's blue brief, preempts, subject to three specific statutory extensions, all State law covered class actions, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="38.945" offset="307256">"by any private party who alleges misrepresentations, omissions, or fraudulent behavior in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security. "</text>
            <text syncTime="49.216" offset="348425">The Second Circuit erred in implying an exception, that nowhere appears in the statutory language, and is wholly at odds with the purpose in the enactment of the statute for holders claims, a type of claim in which a plaintiff alleges, "I did not purchase" or</text>
            <text syncTime="67.352" offset="420941">"I did not sell, but would have, had I known the allegedly false information. "</text>
            <text syncTime="73.380" offset="445078">a type of claim which this Court, in Blue Chip Stamps, over 30 years ago, recognized as the most vexatious and abusive type of securities class action claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.923" offset="491158">The court below erred, for a number of different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.102" offset="503906">First and foremost, it completely violated the natural meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.656" offset="526162">As I have mentioned, an examination of SLUSA, beginning at page 8(a), reflects that no covered class action may be maintained, quote, "by any private party", a clause that this Court, time and again, has interpreted as perhaps the broadest way of phrasing "any and all private parties" making certain types of allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.550" offset="609754">Those allegations appear in (a) or (b), focusing on the conduct of the defendant in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.379" offset="649042">Now, Congress could have... had it intended to inject a purchase/seller limitation, consistent with what the court below concluded, Congress could have phrased that language differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.435" offset="697212">As the Court is aware, in the both the 1933 and 1934 acts, Congress has made express causes of action, subject to an explicit purchase or seller requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.579" offset="753845">For example, section 11 of the '33 act affords a private right of action to purchasers of securities in registered offerings.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.903" offset="787177">Section 12 affords a private right of action to persons from whom an offer or sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.930" offset="811210">Section 9(e) of the '34 act, similarly, affords a purchase or seller requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.660" offset="834198">Significantly, SLUSA nowhere speaks in terms of a purchase or sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.376" offset="856977">And it could have.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.887" offset="859066">For example, Congress could have provided that no covered class action by any private party alleging "his or her sale" of a covered security is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.006" offset="911520">It could have said,</text>
            <text syncTime="191.288" offset="916640">"Any private party alleging a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the plaintiff or that party's purchase or sale. "</text>
            <text syncTime="201.983" offset="959481">It did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.718" offset="966377">The decision of the court below is also at odds with this Court's teaching in United States versus O'Hagan, which was decided 1 year before SLUSA was enacted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.901" offset="1011099">In United States versus O'Hagan, this Court concluded that the so called "misappropriation theory" stated a viable claim in a criminal case brought by the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.097" offset="1059896">In responding to an argument by the defendant that no one involved that had been defrauded purchased or--</text>

            <text syncTime="628.954" offset="2667367">So, in other words, if this Court were to have concluded, in Blue Chip... excuse me... in United States versus O'Hagan, that, as a criminal matter, the "in connection with" language is not tethered to the purchase or sale by a particular party in the case, that is a broader reading than the reading that the court below adopted in a civil case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.396" offset="5457140">Your Honor, that was an accurate description of the state of the law, as it existed at the time, at least in theory, although, as a practical matter, Respondents have not been able to point to a single reported case a... of a holder class action in State court prior to the adoption of the Uniform Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.822" offset="5530805">So, while it was true, as a theoretical matter, that such claims could be brought under the law of some States, there are... there is no history of State class actions in this area, which is one of the reasons why we think that reliance on the assumption of nonpreemption makes no sense here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.871" offset="5583050">Securities class actions prior to the PSLRA were brought in Federal court, and it was only the PSLRA that resulted in cases, such as the type of case at issue here, being brought in State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.148" offset="5632056">And Congress... once it saw that problem, Congress was concerned that the requirements of the PSLRA were being evaded, and it was also concerned, as the conference committee report makes clear, that, now that these securities class actions were being brought in State court, there was the potential danger of 50 varying State standards being applied, as this very case suggests, and Congress acted to remedy both of those problems, as the conference committee report makes clear, both the risk of nonuniformity in securities class actions that are targeted by the act, and the risk of evasion of the PSLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.284" offset="5760683">Respondent's position would frustrate both of those objectives, because it would... it would permit the most abusive category of lawsuits to proceed in State court, and it would permit such holder claims to be brought... for instance, based on negligence, if State law permitted that; based on conduct that would be protected by the Federal safe harbor for forward looking statements under the PSLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.277" offset="5844588">So, the PSLRA protections would be frustrated by their interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.437" offset="5857231">So, the very goals that Congress explicitly sought to achieve, stated in the... in the text of the statute, in the purposes section and also in the conference committee report, would be frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.935" offset="5895266">And, again, that approach requires the Court to accept an inconsistent interpretation of the text of the "in connection with" requirement, depending on the identity of the plaintiff, which would be an extraordinary way to construe a statute, particularly when there's nothing in the legislative history that provides even a hint of a suggestion that Congress would have intended that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.066" offset="5975827">And with respect to Blue Chip, Your Honor, it's important to remember what Blue Chip was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.140" offset="5996098">Blue Chip was not a case about the scope of the 10(b) prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.073" offset="6027759">Instead, it was a case about what to infer about what Congress would have wanted to authorize as an... as a right of action, if it had addressed the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.337" offset="6056911">And that's why the Blue Chip court made very clear that the conduct at issue there involving injuries to holders can be a violation of section 10(b)... i.e., it can be in connection with the purchase or sale of securities... it's just that they did not think that Congress would have wanted to authorize a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.083" offset="6131830">So, again, when we're talking about the scope of the "in connection with" requirement, which is what is at issue here, that approach is the same approach that should be followed here, the same approach that was in... followed in O'Hagan and in Zandford, and compelled to the conclusion that, since the conduct at issue here is unquestionably</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.063" offset="6199749">"in connection with the purchase and sale of securities. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3122.668" offset="12642172">--one of the strange things about this case and the SEC's position is that District Courts are going to be put in the rather unusual position of paying a rather high cost, because if they are confronted with a removal of a case brought under State law, where the defendant asserts that it is preempted under SLUSA, and the SEC hasn't taken any action at all, and has expressed no interest in this particular area, the District Court, to determine preemption, has to intuit whether or not this is within the SEC's enforcement authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.818" offset="12774769">So, you have... ordinarily, you would have private plaintiffs suing for wrongdoing on the same side of the case as the SEC, as the public enforcer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.685" offset="12810296">But, here, you have them at loggerheads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.760" offset="12818550">And the only way that the District Court can properly figure that out, whether or not the private victim can get a private remedy, is to cut back on the SEC's enforcement authority, will... if you will... would exact an awfully high cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.354" offset="12876960">I would submit that that kind of an anomaly is a rather unusual one, particularly where the SEC isn't a party in the case, and it is not being invited to submit a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.391" offset="12925130">And yet, District Courts, in order to determine the preemption question here, are going to have to rule against the SEC in order to give a private remedy... to recognize a private remedy under State law, or to cut back on a remedy under State law by holding that it is within the SEC's enforcement jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.179" offset="13004229">Ultimately, what Merrill Lynch here is asserting is an immunity for a fraud that uniquely affects a certain class of holders who do not have a remedy under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.489" offset="13057519">And I would submit that, where any party is seeking to get an immunity from an intentional fraud, the party bears a heavy presumption that that is, in fact, what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.730" offset="13098479">And I would submit to you that, both with the language of the statute, the findings that Congress made in the legislative history, Congress did not express an intent to eliminate holder class actions of greater than 49 persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="3279.957" offset="13271305">And that's the important point, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.446" offset="13281336">The point was not to allow State law claims under State court systems, but to rechannel those actions into Federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.974" offset="13675367">The... finding number 5 does not use the word "certain" anywhere in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.372" offset="13696996">What finding number 5 does say, however,</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.040" offset="13707654">"It is appropriate to enact national standards for securities class action lawsuits involving nationally traded securities while preserving the appropriate enforcement powers of State securities regulators and not changing the current treatment of individual lawsuits. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.618" offset="13786022">quote/unquote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.201" offset="13788320">Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg asked questions that I think illustrate that Congress could not have intended such an anomalous result by allowing holders' claims to proceed as nonpreempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.001" offset="13843491">Justice Breyer, as a practical matter, you are 100 percent right in the premise of your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.579" offset="13865852">If this Court agrees with... that the court below is correct, every single securities class action that is brought in Federal court from that day forward will have a companion claim brought with it, asserted by holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.787" offset="13930635">And it's not simply holders in the fashion that Mr. Dabit appears, which is somebody who claims,</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.217" offset="13956340">"I would have sold, had I, essentially, known inside information. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.702" offset="13978283">a proposition which Judge Friendly expounded on in the Levine case in the Second Circuit, but you will also have holders... you will also have claims by people who come to court, in the State court, and say,</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.223" offset="14032408">"You know, I would have bought securities if you had not issued such unduly pessimistic projections. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.671" offset="14070234">just as was the case in the Blue Chip Stamp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.339" offset="14080892">And imagine the impact that that result would have on the safe harbor, which Congress enacted with the PSLRA to protect public companies in the United States and abroad, encouraging them to make forward looking statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.345" offset="14140869">If you allow a result which affords putative people, who would have bought and would have sold, in State court where the safe harbor doesn't apply, you will absolutely be gutting the statutory protections that Congress was seeking to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.234" offset="14208474">I'd like to just make one point about the Weinberger verse... the Weinberger v. Kendrick case that is mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.784" offset="14234701">That involved an approval of a Federal court class action where State law holders' claims were being released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.127" offset="14264062">In fact, the consideration that was approved there was less, because the claims were weaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.189" offset="14280258">We've heard a lot, Your Honors, about why Congress didn't mention holders' claims by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.086" offset="14303873">The reason they didn't mention holders' claims by name is that it wasn't until SLUSA was enacted and creative plaintiff strike suit lawyers brought holders' claims, in an effort to avoid SLUSA, that this problem became exacerbated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.228" offset="14372418">But there is no doubt that the plain and natural meaning of SLUSA picks up all claims by any private party in connection with the purchase or sale of security.</text>
