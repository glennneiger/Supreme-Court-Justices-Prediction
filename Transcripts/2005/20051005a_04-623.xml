            <text syncTime="220.754" offset="1039833">There's also a technical difference, which is, with respect to lethal injection, it's not the federally controlled substance which is the lethal agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.663" offset="1363542">Well, what we're getting... at least what I'm getting at was this is, I would probably have read the statute to say that the drug statute, which is trying to stop drug addiction and heroin and... has nothing to do with the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.524" offset="1418922">And I would think that the argument on the other side is that the statute has nothing to do with assisted suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.406" offset="1450478">Congress didn't think about the death penalty, and it didn't think about assisted suicide.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.340" offset="1502200">I think that, first of all, I would say that Congress did focus on suicide, if not physician assisted suicide, and I think that's an important distinction that I'd like to come back to.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.815" offset="1536055">But I actually think the comparison to the tobacco case is quite instructive, because there what you had is a statute in which something seemed like it might come within the plain terms of the FDCA, and yet if you took that literally, it would run smack into another statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.563" offset="1599062">And here, there is no other statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.792" offset="1612019">To the contrary, the most natural reading of the Controlled Substances Act, I would say... and I'll address it in a minute... is that this falls within the authority of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.210" offset="1649635">And if you look to any alternative congressional indication of intent on this topic, the only thing you would find is the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997, which continues a Federal policy against assisted suicide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3337.262" offset="13505883">That's absolutely true, Justice Souter. But... this case is obviously about statutory construction, but it's about statutory construction in a very special area, and that is the area of federalism, of the relationship between the sovereign States and the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.661" offset="13571503">We think it's clear, from examining the statute, that Congress intended to retain and respect the historic powers of the States to define legitimate medical practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="3370.669" offset="13639526">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.730" offset="13651751">I think Respondents have embraced the logical consequences of their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.663" offset="13671500">And what it results in is turning the Controlled Substances Act, the federal Controlled Substances Act, into an odd patchwork.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.434" offset="13698563">It also is profoundly ahistorical, because, at the time of the Harrison Act of 1914... which the Controlled Substances Act was intended to strengthen, not weaken, as this Court pointed out in Moore... at that time, the States had a variety of different approaches to opium and heroin and other... and cocaine and other substances... opium and cocaine now of which land on schedule 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.198" offset="13785603">Some of them tightly regulated them, some of them allowed them in over the counter tonics in large quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.644" offset="13807441">And the point of the Harrison Act was to clean that up and impose a uniform Federal regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.647" offset="13827398">And they knew it would have an impact on State regulation of medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.060" offset="13845057">And even the Court, in the Linder days, recognize that that was not, per se, a constitutional problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.672" offset="13887480">Well, it's an odd statutory... I mean, I'm not familiar with the... with the principle that the Federal authority only extends to prevent that which would gut the statute, and no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.722" offset="13927709">That seems like an odd principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.617" offset="13935336">And I think that, here, it is a perfectly legitimate interpretation of this statute to say that a Congress that was profoundly concerned with overdoses, with suicide, with drug abuse, precisely because of its debilitating effect on people's lives, would not have been agnostic at the prospect of--</text>

            <text syncTime="3474.052" offset="14053096">They were all over the map, but there was clearly a recognition that doctors were part and parcel of the problem, that there were needs in States to more closely regulate both the doctors and the pharmacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.742" offset="14095833">That was, kind of, the two problems that gave rise to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.390" offset="14106386">And there's no question that the impact of the Federal program was profound on the State's practice of medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.888" offset="14132404">Nonetheless, that program was upheld, and that has been the tradition in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.786" offset="14184022">The Harrison Act did not have the schedules we're familiar with from the Controlled Substance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3531.878" offset="14284332">I don't think so, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.444" offset="14290602">It's the same reason as my answer earlier, which is, I think you have to look at this regime, and read it in light of the 90 years of Federal involvement in the regulation of controlled substances and the lack of a traditional Federal role in regulating medicine qua medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.935" offset="14344623">And I think this is on the... on the side of the line of regulating controlled substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.267" offset="14361864">With respect to the commerce clause issue, I would... thought that one thing that came clear out of the Raich decision is that the relevant factor to consider is not the class of activities that a State decides to decriminalize, but, rather, the class of activities that Congress decides to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.625" offset="14427379">And with respect to schedule 2 substances, I would think this case is a fortiori.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.448" offset="14446605">We're not talking about substances that are homegrown and are never part of a commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.571" offset="14467085">And even those who were in the dissent in Raich, I think, would think that this was an appropriate commerce clause application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.175" offset="14489550">This case is to Raich as the regulation of commercial farming would be to Wickard against Filburn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.659" offset="14511493">It is a much different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.497" offset="14518807">Congress's commerce clause power is more robust here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.195" offset="14529674">I wanted to remark and focus for a minute on what an odd statute Oregon has passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.198" offset="14549632">The practitioner respondents point out it is a prescribing law only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.110" offset="14565305">And Oregon itself points out that what's allowed here is the prescription, but not the administration, of these substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.438" offset="14590592">Even what Oregon does, does not purport to be medicine, as one traditionally understands it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.743" offset="14611803">I can think of no other medical substance where a doctor can prescribe it, but not administer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.869" offset="14632283">And I think if you look at that aspect of the statute, what becomes clear is that Oregon is not regulating medicine, it's purporting to basically take a Federal regulatory regime that allows doctors the ability to get at schedule 2 substances.</text>
