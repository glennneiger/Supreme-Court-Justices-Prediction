            <text syncTime="5.603" offset="110727">The Controlled Substances Act, sometimes referred to as the CSA, it’s a federal law and it’s central to federal enforcement of the nation’s laws prohibiting drug abuse and drug trafficking.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.380" offset="157852">As we have explained in other decisions, the design of the CSA is to list covered substances in one of five schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.255" offset="185333">Schedule I lists the most dangerous drugs; Schedule II drugs are generally available only pursuant to a written and nonrefillable prescription by a physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.711" offset="231204">In this case, the Attorney General of the United States did not add drugs to Schedule II; the Attorney General did prohibit doctors from issuing prescriptions for Schedule II drugs for use in assisted suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.276" offset="277388">The Attorney General took this step by an announcement on November 9, 2001, and it is called an interpretive rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.930" offset="304033">The occasion for the rule was an Oregon law enacted by a statewide ballot measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.551" offset="326498">The law is entitled that Oregon Death with Dignity Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.926" offset="339977">It legalized physician-assisted suicide under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.051" offset="360562">The Oregon law, unique to that one state, applies to Oregon licensed physicians and terminally ill patients in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.968" offset="392222">The patients must have been diagnosed with an incurable and irreversible disease likely to cause death within six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.829" offset="419599">Before prescribing the dosage, the physician must take a number of steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.301" offset="437466">These include certifying that the request is voluntary; that there is no psychological disorder; giving information to the patient about alternative care and counseling; obtaining conformation from a second physician; and maintaining detailed records, which are open for State inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.075" offset="512595">The interpretive rule issued by Attorney General relies on the CSA’s requirement that prescriptions be issued for a legitimate medical purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.562" offset="542583">It concluded that assisting suicide is not a legitimate medical purpose, so any prescription under the Oregon Death with Dignity Act would become unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.005" offset="584379">A physician in violation of the statute also would risk deregistration under the Act, preventing him or her from issuing any prescription at all for control substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.197" offset="625130">Various physicians, pharmacists and patients in Oregon brought suit in federal court to declare the interpretive rule invalid as exceeding the Attorney General’s authority under the CSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.474" offset="670165">The United States District Court enjoined enforcement of the interpretive rule, and the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed, and the case is now before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.658" offset="702975">Although the dispute in this case is, in part, a product of the nation’s political and moral debate on assisted suicide, the central question is whether the interpretive rule is authorized by the CSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.064" offset="756578">We conclude the rule is not authorized by the CSA, and we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.332" offset="781656">The rule is an interpretation by an Executive Officer of the Government, and we must first determine how much deference to give the Attorney General’s reading of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.099" offset="816660">The Court’s decision in Auer versus Robbins requires substantial deference to an agency’s interpretations of its own regulations; but we do not think Auer requires us to give substantial deference here, because the interpretive rule relies on a regulation that simply repeats the substantive requirements of the CSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.059" offset="900565">Second, we do not think deference is warranted under our decision in Chevron versus Natural Resources Defense Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.984" offset="940271">Our later decision in United States versus Mead held that Chevron deference is warranted only when it appears Congress delegated authority to the agency to make rules carrying the force of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.046" offset="984470">Here, the phrase “legitimate medical purpose” is indeed a generality susceptible to a more precise definition; in our view, however, the rule was not made pursuant to authority delegated to the Attorney General, so it does not receive Chevron deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.933" offset="1044030">In the opinion today, we recite these and other reasons for finding the Attorney General lacked authority to issue the interpretive rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.916" offset="1071928">The statute and our case law amply support the conclusion that Congress sought to regulate medical practice insofar as it bars doctors from using their prescription-writing powers as a means of drug dealing and trafficking as traditionally understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.164" offset="1125009">The CSA, however, manifests no intend to regulate medical practice generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.387" offset="1145907">This is not surprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.025" offset="1152386">Our federal structure of government gives the States great latitude to legislate to protect the lives and health of their citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.573" offset="1182583">Indeed, the structure and operation of the CSA presume and rely upon a State-regulated profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.829" offset="1207661">It defines “medical practitioners” as physicians license by their state and considers the recommendation of State Medical Boards in registration decisions, and it preempts state laws only to the extent there is a positive conflict with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.977" offset="1260219">The Oregon regime discussed above is an example of the very State regulation the CSA presupposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.446" offset="1290103">Under the statutory scheme of the CSA, the Control Substances Act, the Attorney General is an unlikely recipient of the broad authority he seeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.369" offset="1333780">Just as the conventions of interpretation indicate Congress is unlikely to alter a statute’s obvious scope through muffled hints.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.607" offset="1366694">The background principles of our federal system belie the notion that Congress would use such an obscure grant of authority to regulate areas traditionally governed by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.170" offset="1405042">The Government in the end maintains that the prescription requirement delegates to a single Executive Officer the power to shift radically authority from the states to the federal government to define general standards of medical practice in every locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.292" offset="1461466">The text and the structure of the CSA show that Congress did not have this far-reaching intent, and we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.339" offset="1493649">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion, joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Thomas; Justice Thomas has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
