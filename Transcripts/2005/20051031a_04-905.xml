            <text syncTime="1367.967" offset="5627092">So, there... the causation element that's so crucial under the Act is absolutely missing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.733" offset="5650184">And, in fact, Reeder's interpretation would simply read the injury requirement out of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.100" offset="9527592">And in respect to the policy, what worries me about the broader interpretation is suddenly doing what Volvo... forbidding Volvo from doing what it probably wants to do here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2622.785" offset="10646364">And it's quite clear, and it's been clear since 1948 in Justice Black's opinion for the Court in Morton Salt, that this is designed to recognize that when you harm an intrabrand competitor, that that's the kind of injury to competition that this statute was aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.180" offset="10703938">And this Court reaffirmed that both in the 1980s, reaffirmed it again in 1990, in Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.337" offset="10724522">And it's... and notwithstanding some effort to ask the Court to revisit Morton Salt at this point, it seems to me that that principle ought to be completely settled at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.963" offset="10759108">If there's to be any fix there, it ought to be a fix that's offered up by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.917" offset="10774886">To go back to, then, your point, Justice Scalia, I told you, first, you have this discrimination in price, you have to show that it's substantial, lasts for a substantial period of time, you get the Morton Salt inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.421" offset="10820862">You... then we still have to show, under section 4 of the Clayton Act, that we have actual injury to our business and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.062" offset="10851477">And in this context, it seems to me, the evidence is absolutely overwhelming, because you have a situation where, in 1995, we are next to none dealer for Volvo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.955" offset="10891079">In 1995, we're selling 66 cars, we're making $165,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2695.380" offset="10936741">It engages in systematic discrimination, both with respect to unquestionable purchases on both sides and, candidly, more broadly than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.538" offset="10973417">And the effect of that, at the end of the day, is that our sales go from 65 to 34 to 18 to 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.321" offset="11008526">Our gross profits dropped to $26,327.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.790" offset="11030364">You compare that to the kind of evidence this Court looked at in the... in the J.

            <text syncTime="2734.701" offset="11093998">And, even in that context, this Court was unwilling to say that the Fifth Circuit's decision holding that the evidence was flat out inconsistent... or inadequate to sustain the verdict, was overturned, had to be sent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.282" offset="11148333">I submit to you, the evidence in this case is vastly stronger.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.876" offset="12326769">I think the answer to your question is, under Morton Salt we clearly win, because we... we probably didn't need to show as much as we did, in terms of the impact of this particular discrimination on our ability to compete in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.425" offset="12368878">I think we were entitled to a straight inference of that, in terms of the substantial... or reasonable possibility of injury in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.647" offset="12397822">But, beyond that, I... you know, you could certainly hold, in this case, that Reeder Simco has made more than enough of a case in order to recover under the Robinson Patman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.312" offset="12572424">But it's obviously much tougher when you only have one head to head.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.687" offset="12581933">It's completely different when you're talking about 102 sales to sales comparisons over years, with significant differentials, that clearly caused the kind of injury we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.973" offset="12651105">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.520" offset="12661345">The heart of the theory of this case came up in colloquy between the Chief Justice and Mr. Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.943" offset="12679004">The Chief Justice pointed out that Reeder doesn't lose a sale because of the concession that Volvo gives to the other dealer, which makes this quite different from every other Robinson Patman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.835" offset="12726547">Mr. Phillips' response was,</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.164" offset="12731876">"That's today, Your Honor. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.102" offset="12739608">"But our future ability to compete is impaired. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.399" offset="12748803">Well, that's very similar to the evidence this Court referred to as J. Truett Payne.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.681" offset="12765939">The Court didn't go all the way and say that that wasn't enough to give rise to damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act, but the... but all nine Justices agreed that such evidence was very weak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.981" offset="12807108">The Fifth Circuit, on remand, threw out the jury verdict, a case that arose in the same posture as this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.528" offset="12825290">And there is not... as we said in the reply brief, Reeder is complaining about price, not price discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.499" offset="12853188">Now, let me say a word or two about the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.577" offset="12861548">Mr. Phillips says the "Volvo Vision" was to get rid of dealers, and to do so through price discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.953" offset="12883073">That is a leap of faith that Reeder asked the jury to make at trial, but there is not an iota of evidence connecting Volvo's interest in making its dealer network smaller and more efficient to price discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.598" offset="12937616">That's entirely a leap of faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.770" offset="12942318">Mr. Phillips says an inference should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.176" offset="12951931">That's not the kind of inference we usually allow juries to draw in antitrust cases without some evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.458" offset="12973038">The evidence was actually that Reeder's biggest customer, New Hi Way, which was 82 percent of its business, was bought by a Memphis company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.913" offset="13006893">So, just to point to Reeder's before and after sales is really terribly misleading, in terms of causation here between so called discrimination and the decline in Reeder's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.089" offset="13055585">The so called 102 sales are four transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.370" offset="13068751">There's one 77-truck transaction to New Hi Way before it was bought by the Memphis company, and 25 other trucks in the other three transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.684" offset="13101979">They are all cases in which all Reeder did was take its own completed sales and compare them to sales by some other dealer in some other State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.748" offset="13138237">Reeder wasn't competing for the sale to that dealer's customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.827" offset="13150566">That customer wasn't competing for the sale to Reeder's customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.454" offset="13165091">So it is, as Justice Ginsburg's questions pointed out, completely a mix and match approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.845" offset="13182645">And Bill Heck conceded that there were times when Reeder got better concessions than other dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.378" offset="13204692">If you have a company that doesn't engage in uniform pricing, as Volvo does not, it's not going to be hard for any plaintiff, whether it's Reeder or Reeder's competitor, to come up with instances in which it was the so called disfavored dealer if it is admissible to compare transactions to completely unrelated transactions, which is what the proof at trial in this case was.</text>
