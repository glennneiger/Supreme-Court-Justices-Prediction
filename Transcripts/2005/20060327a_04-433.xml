            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144625">We'll hear argument first this morning in 04-433, Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.354" offset="177957">Mr. Frederick.</text>

          <turn speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="9.405" stopTime="162.447">
            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="9.405" offset="182241">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.778" offset="199691">This case concerns use of alleged fraud in the underpayment of taxes as the predicate for a treble damages civil RICO action.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.239" offset="241487">Respondent Ideal Steel concedes that it was not defrauded, but it, nonetheless, claims lost profits when National failed to pay State sales taxes and thereby offered a lower overall price to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.135" offset="301151">Our position is that Ideal's injury is too indirect as a matter of law under RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.185" offset="329363">In reinstating Ideal's RICO claims against National, however, the Second Circuit committed two errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.492" offset="362591">First, it substituted a direct targeting test that credited the plaintiff's allegations of intent instead of applying this Court's test for proximate causation in the Holmes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.993" offset="416507">And second, the Second Circuit permitted Ideal to satisfy the reliance requirement by invoking the State of New York's reliance on the truth of National's allegedly false tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.568" offset="478888">Both errors transformed civil RICO into a litigation weapon of great destructive force for defendants who will be forced to defend, beyond the pleading stages, damages claims of the most attenuated and indirect character.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.239" offset="545552">With respect to our first argument, proximate cause, the court below erred by not applying this Court's test in Holmes and also by failing to take into account the fact that fraud is a statutory violation that... for which the plaintiff needs to be within the zone of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.962" offset="640429">Quite simply, because Ideal was not the defrauded party, it is not within the zone of interest protected by the fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.373" offset="670104">With respect to the Holmes factors, for three reasons the... Ideal Steel is unable to plead proximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.032" offset="708661">First, in Holmes, this Court made clear that where there's an indirect plaintiff, the claims are difficult to prove in terms of ascertaining what the level of damages is.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.498" offset="758607">That is particularly true in this case because of the highly attenuated chain of causation that allege... that Ideal alleges as a factual matter.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="162.447" offset="794343">Well, isn't there something different here?</text>
            <text syncTime="164.481" offset="802493">Because in... in Holmes, the... the party that was claiming the... sort of the ultimate damage was damaged because other people up the line were damaged, the... the shareholders and then the broker dealers and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.823" offset="871874">There was a kind of a direct line of... of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.050" offset="880756">But the people who were claiming were at the tail end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.502" offset="894548">Here, the causation between the... or the... or the cause of the harm to... to the clients on... on the other side was... was direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.540" offset="946689">It was direct competition harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.927" offset="956302">So we are in a different situation from Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.368" offset="970094">In other words, they... they weren't... the... the plaintiffs in this case were not injured simply because New York lost some money.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.263" offset="1001650">They were injured in... in their own right by... by the competition between them and your client.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.594" offset="1030907">I don't agree, Justice Souter, and here's why.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.742" offset="1039580">In Holmes, the customers were the ones who were denied proximate cause in this decision... in... in the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.522" offset="1066643">They stood in a direct line from the harm that was caused when the companies were defrauded and the stock value caused the brokerage to go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.077" offset="1100916">It was completely foreseeable that customers that owned the shares in those firms would also suffer direct harm.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="245.526" offset="1126725">Sure, but they suffered the harm because the firm suffered the harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.366" offset="1142085">There was... there was... there's a word there.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.331" offset="1149921">There was... there was a victim in... in the direct line of causation, if you will, between them and... and the... and the offending RICO party.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.863" offset="1192031">Here, there's... there's nobody in between the two of them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_c_frederick" startTime="265.837" stopTime="326.156">
            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="265.837" offset="1207913">That... that's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.342" offset="1213974">There is, and New York is in between them in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.731" offset="1227453">If... Ideal is asserting that because the taxes had not been charged and then paid to the State of New York, that National gained a competitive advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.802" offset="1267786">But I think the Court has been clear that the competitive harms... and this was true in the Associated General Contracting case in which the Court in Holmes relied directly... is not going to be sufficient when there are multiple steps in the chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.347" offset="1329957">Here, as a factual matter, Justice Souter, they have to be able to link every individual sale for which there was not a tax paid, assert that that person was wrongfully not charged a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.484" offset="1390561">Under New York law, under certain circumstances, if a contractor has a certificate, it's not appropriate for the vendor in this case to charge the sales tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.013" offset="1432671">And then they have to be able to show that they would have gotten the sale--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="326.156" offset="1449180">Well, why... why is that true?</text>
            <text syncTime="327.883" offset="1456076">Let's assume that they could establish that there was a purpose and an intent to adopt this... this tax evasion scheme and that the whole object was to undermine and... and injure the competitor, and they show that this scheme began to work and that their reputation as a lower cost competitor was... was well established.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.633" offset="1563074">Why... why isn't that enough?</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="355.998" offset="1568612">--Because this Court rejected a similar theory in section 4 of the Clayton Act context where it held that a specific intent to injure is not sufficient as a pleading matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.472" offset="1614483">The Court in that case held that where an association had a... an... a specific intent to harm the unions, that that was not sufficient for invoking section 4 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.297" offset="1661712">The same analysis applies here because what Ideal is attempting to do is to use artful pleading as a way to get around the proximate cause requirement through their simple assertions that there are no, in fact, other competitors within a three State area and that National was targeting them for competitive harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.271" offset="1745618">They're attempting to evade the normal requirements for proximate cause that look to whether or not the direct injury is suffered by the plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.067" offset="1780831">Mr. Frederick, you... you started by saying how difficult this would be to prove, but could the plaintiff piggyback on New York?</text>
            <text syncTime="419.818" offset="1823881">If New York was the defrauded party and taxes are owed to the State, has the State had no proceeding in this?</text>

            <text syncTime="430.141" offset="1865154">Well, as the briefs indicate... and we're somewhat outside the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.410" offset="1878215">As the case some to this Court, it's on the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.697" offset="1887410">But the footnotes in the brief give a little bit of a flavor of what has happened since then, and there are audit proceedings that the State of New York has commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.636" offset="1927116">It has not commenced any kind of civil or criminal proceeding against National, nor has it brought a RICO action against National.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.583" offset="1962956">But there are discussions with the State at the level of the auditors as to whether or not any back tax is owed and, if so, in what amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.892" offset="2000155">Do I understand correctly that the complaint has since been amended to assert a Federal income tax shortfall?</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="472.377" offset="2034114">That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.232" offset="2041533">And as we pointed out in our reply brief, there are in excess of 500,000 corporate income tax statements that are issued by the IRS for underpayment each year and in excess of 6 million unemployment underpayment notices sent out.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.304" offset="2109765">And under Ideal's theory, each of those would be a predicate act for a RICO case, asserting treble damages where one competitor could use the in terrorem effect of a RICO claim simply because of an underpayment of tax notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.814" offset="2191789">We have to assume that for purposes of this pleading except insofar as it acknowledges whether or not a legal requirement is satisfied, and I think that the cases of this Court and certainly the commentators have been clear the Court does not need to assume a fact for purposes of a legal conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.233" offset="2269529">As the... as the footnotes indicate, that has not been borne out by discovery, and there are, in fact, multiple competitors.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.592" offset="2306937">But do you think it's fair to interpret the Second Circuit as having, in effect, held that every competitor of anybody who cheats on his taxes has a RICO claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="564.823" offset="2403903">And under the Second Circuit's test, that would be sufficient to override a motion to dismiss and proceed the parties into protracted discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.194" offset="2441311">And what the Court in Associated General Contracting and in Holmes made clear was that the courts were not designed to be the forums for this kind of long, arduous fact finding mission in order to determine whether or not indirect injuries should be compensable with treble damages under the RICO statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.704" offset="2575371">Mr. Chief Justice, the way we get to the proximate cause requirement through Holmes is through 1964(c)'s use of by reason of a violation of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.936" offset="2632318">We submit that the proximate cause inquiry is the same whether it's a 62(a) violation or a 62(c) violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.870" offset="2664083">And in fact, Ideal has not advanced really any argument to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.193" offset="2681324">They sued under 1962(a) in order to get a deeper pocket, National, which they would not be able to get under 1962(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="659.019" offset="2780694">And it seems to me all they have to show is that the proceeds used for that were illicitly procured.</text>

            <text syncTime="665.406" offset="2806189">They... that's not their allegation, though, in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.634" offset="2819146">The theory that your hypothesis is postulating is a money laundering predicate act, but they don't assert money laundering as the predicate act.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.083" offset="2856867">They assert fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.426" offset="2862300">And it's exactly the same conduct, the alleged underpayment of taxes that is fraudulently sent to the State of New York, and through that, an indirect injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.630" offset="2907126">So their theory under (a) and under (c) of section 1962 factually is exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.190" offset="2933353">The only reason that they brought in an (a) claim is, as I pointed out, to get at the pocket with suing National as a corporate defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.288" offset="2969716">But I would point out here, in further answer to your question, Justice Ginsburg, the State of New York, under the Holmes test, is the proper plaintiff for purposes of vindicating the law's purposes, which after all, is to negate the activity of fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.503" offset="5598574">But under the Holmes test, that becomes much easier to ascertain because you know where the damages are.</text>

            <text syncTime="3267.239" offset="13213477">I'd like to return to Justice Souter's hypothetical because I think that the point of price competition fits squarely within the Holmes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.447" offset="13250362">If you were to take the fact of bankruptcy, the mere going bankrupt of the brokers in that case, the... the effect of that on the customers who are attempting to bootstrap in the securities fraud fits perfectly here because the fraud here against the State of New York enables National allegedly to engage in price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.333" offset="13337925">But as you pointed out in your hypothetical, price competition is not a RICO violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.808" offset="13359763">And using 1964(c)'s by reason of, the injury has to be by the RICO violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.301" offset="13389752">Simply lowering prices or making their goods more economically affordable does not cause... is not a RICO violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.246" offset="13425592">The... the RICO violation, if there is one here, is in the fraudulent underpayment of taxes to the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.706" offset="13451401">The SG's brief in the Bank of China case does, we acknowledge, make the suggestion about possible third party reliance, but it does not cite any decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.710" offset="13495391">It cites two court of appeals cases, one of which is the decision below, which we argue was wrongly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.849" offset="13519946">The point that the SG, I think, was making was acknowledging that there are these circumstances, and I would advert to my earlier colloquy with Justice Scalia in which there are limited circumstances in which a third party can invoke the reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.252" offset="13577624">But that is ordinarily done through a relationship among the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.596" offset="13594969">The breadth of the respondent's position here should not go uncommented upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.446" offset="13622346">RICO is not an unfair competition statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.857" offset="13636034">Yet, the answers to the hypotheticals about how many competitors would be able to bring and whether or not they were directly targeted and the cigarette hypothetical all point to the fact that, at bottom, their theory is that any action on the part of a defendant that leads to an indirect ability to engage in price competition would give rise to a RICO claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.583" offset="13726940">And as we point out in our reply brief, there are literally millions... just on taxes alone, millions... of submissions by corporations that could be used by competitors if the direct targeting test is accepted by this Court as the predicate for a RICO claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.989" offset="13800501">We submit that the floodgates should not be opened in that way, particularly given the fact that the difficulties of proving harm and damages are especially present here and that antitrust cases should not be shoehorned under the RICO statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.252" offset="13869569">That is not what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.990" offset="13880540">Finally, with respect to reliance, this Court in Beck v. Prupis held that civil conspiracy principles should be imported into the understanding of what a civil action under RICO should be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.527" offset="13942712">And the common law is well settled that reliance is an element that is appropriate for it to be imported into the mail fraud predicate act here because the damages have to be shown by some type of relationship between the defrauded party and the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.478" offset="14010525">If the Court has no further questions.</text>
