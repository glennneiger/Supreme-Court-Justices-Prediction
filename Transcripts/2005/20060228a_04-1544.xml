            <text syncTime="226.799" offset="1059710">However, I think it is an important principle to interpret the... the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute, look at the language of that statute, and determine what Congress intended from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.217" offset="1101297">And... and I think it also is a dangerous thing to get into, implying exceptions into that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.720" offset="1143407">Obviously, in this case we have an action, the... the in rem jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over the chose in action, that is... is miles away from the probate of... of a will.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.838" offset="1203802">The particular cause of action involved here was an interference with an inter vivos gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.630" offset="1226999">And I think it's important to realize that that was intended to be a gift that would be complete during the lifetime of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.789" offset="1263674">That fact means that this case really has almost nothing to do with probate or probate jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.607" offset="1382897">And wasn't the ground for that that it would be inconsistent with the inter vivos trust that you are asserting in the bankruptcy court proceeding?</text>

            <text syncTime="318.704" offset="1427306">The... the grounds for that was the belief that there had been undue influence with respect to the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.997" offset="1452488">But the inter vivos gift claim... a tortious interference with inter vivos gift claim... that was added only many years later in the year 2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.916" offset="1496164">That was 3 years, 3 and a half years after that same action was pending in the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.553" offset="1518734">And the only reason it was raised at that time was that respondent went to the Federal court and said... and interposed the probate exception and argued at that time there is no jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.389" offset="1561993">Therefore, out of an excess of caution, our client went to the Texas probate court and said, well, I will... I will make this... this claim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.953" offset="1596266">In fact, once there was success in the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy court said, now I have made a determination on that claim, our client did dismiss claim and dismissed all affirmative claims with respect to the probate estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.810" offset="1651750">I think the important thing to realize here, with respect to both this particular claim and with respect to the bankruptcy jurisdiction statute in particular, is that the... that the breadth of the... what that statute does is, it... it announces that rather than having jurisdictional preclusions, there will be preclusions based on abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.596" offset="1750910">It has broad abstention provisions in section 1334(c), and indeed section 1334(c)(2), which is the mandatory abstension--</text>

            <text syncTime="417.486" offset="1822381">Well, if you want to get into that argument, I guess the strongest argument against keeping it... for keeping it is bankruptcy jurisdictional statutes shouldn't be interpreted differently than diversity jurisdiction or any other statute, and Markham at least recognizes that there is such a thing as the probate exception and that Congress implicitly adopted it, just as they did the domestic relations exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.273" offset="1921542">Therefore, if we are going to find for you on this ground, we'd have to go back and overrule that case and a lot of other water that's flowed over... under the bridge or wherever the water flows.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.369" offset="1969921">And we ought to take what's given as given, whatever the true meaning of ecclesiastical courts having jurisdiction over certain probate matters or not in the 18th century.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.298" offset="2021643">--Well, of course, if one looks at 1334(c)(2), one sees that Congress itself contemplated that there would bankruptcy jurisdiction under circumstances where there was no diversity jurisdiction and when there was no Federal question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.344" offset="2085905">So it... it certainly is true that rolled into the whole notion of mandatory abstention is the possibility that the bankruptcy court will have before it matters over which there would be no diversity jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.682" offset="4019175">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="974.236" offset="4049372">Two independent principles require reversal of the Ninth Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.519" offset="4066509">First, the probate exception to Federal jurisdiction is a will-specific rule and it does not apply beyond the context of wills to other types of will substitutes like inter vivos trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.281" offset="4113634">Second, even with respect to wills, it is a very narrow exception that is no bar to deciding the rights to a decedent's estate, construing a will, or determining the testator's intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.561" offset="4162744">There are only three things under this Court's precedent that a Federal court cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.265" offset="4185523">The first is to probate a will, that is, to determine the formal key requisites of the validity of a will; second, to annul an already probated will; and three, to take in rem jurisdiction over a res over which a State court has already taken in rem jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.164" offset="4265144">But that is it, and none of those are applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.113" offset="4276951">The justifications for the probate exception do not apply to will substitutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.989" offset="4300461">The... the probate exception is based on the peculiar nature of a will, that is, that unlike inter vivos trusts, unlike the current modern will substitutes, a will is not valid... it has no legal effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.191" offset="4357199">This Court's opinions have said that on several occasions... unless it is probated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.545" offset="4370679">Therefore, a will must be probated even if there is no dispute about its validity before any title can pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.432" offset="4398159">Not so with trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.943" offset="4404220">In fact, that is the whole point that people engage in the modern world substitutes is to avoid the necessity to go to the probate court in order to have their assets passed to their heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.018" offset="4440582">The second ground for this Court's probate exception is the historical one based on the Court's understanding of the limits of the equity courts in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.437" offset="4482274">Whatever the merit of that historical analysis, it has not application to trusts, which have always been the problems of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.840" offset="4511844">The Federal Government has a strong interest in the Court not expanding the Federal exception... the... the probate exception to Federal jurisdiction, particularly in the sweeping manner that the Ninth Circuit has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.114" offset="4564925">It is not uncommon for the tax consequences of an estate planning instrument, such as a trust, to turn on whether or not the trust is valid or invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.767" offset="4607557">And the Congress has provided Federal jurisdiction to the United States to bring its... most of its disputes in the Federal court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.247" offset="4637441">Secondly, more generally, Congress has determined what types of disputes should be in the Federal courts and has passed broad statutes providing the courts with Federal jurisdiction that the courts have an obligation to exercise, if it exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.086" offset="4724794">You recognize the existence of this exception in certain cases, and then you argue against it by saying, well, Congress wrote the statutes broadly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.897" offset="4792086">The Court has adopted a very narrow probate exception with respect to the probating of the will and annulling a probated will, but that is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.550" offset="4834718">And that analysis was based on a... the historical... the Court's view of the historical limits of courts of equity and therefore was an interpretation of the Federal diversity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.875" offset="4872021">Under the logic of Ankenbrandt, one can assume... one may... the Court may assume that's carried forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.178" offset="4897203">But certainly that... for the reasons I've said, that rationale, those justifications, for that narrow will rule do not apply to trusts, which have always been the province of equity, and especially given the questionable historical underpinnings of the exception, even the narrow exception that does appear to exist, there's no justification for expanding that beyond its current confines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.527" offset="4990617">As this Court recognized in Ankenbrandt, the lower courts had taken the... the so-called domestic relations exception beyond this Court's very narrow limits, and this Court brought... brought it back to its origins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.706" offset="5039309">And... and the Federal Government believes that... that the same would be appropriate here with respect to the probate exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.343" offset="5061879">Ms. Maynard, it's my understanding that a lot of this law developed out of the dicta in the Markham case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.803" offset="5087688">Do you think the dicta in the Markham case was an accurate description of the prior history?</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.066" offset="5132723">I do think one can read Markham, however, especially if one reads it in the context of the cases it cites for its principles, to hold what we are saying now, which is that Federal courts have no jurisdiction over pure probate matters, that is, no jurisdiction to probate a will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.711" offset="5199283">And its interference language, I believe, was its statement of the in rem v. in rem jurisdiction principle, which in fact isn't really a probate jurisdiction principle at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.165" offset="13953124">In addition, Justice Breyer, you mentioned that there were a number of other instances of tortious misconduct that were found by Justice Carter, in addition to the forging of the... of the irrevocability point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.500" offset="13998473">Indeed, Justice Carter found that there were massive transfers of J. Howard's assets to Pierce Marshall in his last days, and those asset transfers were made in exchange for notes that were payable years in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.545" offset="14058659">This was after J. Howard had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, after he had had a heart attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.922" offset="14084154">Annuities were used to pay for those as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.037" offset="14096589">So that he was essentially stripped of all of his assets by the time he was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.569" offset="14114770">There was... there were no assets in the probate estate at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.951" offset="14132324">Justice Ginsburg, I would refer you to appendix page 42 where the... the district court indicates that both a proof of claim and an adversary complaint were first filed by Pierce Marshall in the bankruptcy court, and that is, indeed, what caused, several months later, the compulsory counterclaim to be filed in a response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.805" offset="14231694">Mr. Brunstad indicated that what happened here was that while the claim was pending in Texas, it was then brought to the bankruptcy court presumably because there was some dissatisfaction on Ms. Marshall's part as to how the Texas probate court was going.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.788" offset="14307658">In fact, page 1 of our reply brief details very specifically the fact that the first time that the tortious interference with gift claim was made was in the bankruptcy court as the compulsory counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.489" offset="14366486">And I would just conclude by stating that the cause of action that was at issue here was really a very common one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.513" offset="14418522">It's the... not in and of itself, but it's common to make a claim against the estate in debt or that a gift was given, and that may, indeed, diminish the estate that is eventually passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.265" offset="14465542">But that doesn't invalidate any of the estate planning documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.548" offset="14478708">It simply means that something that might otherwise have been within the estate was not included in the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.684" offset="14507234">That's really all that happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.612" offset="14514966">The claim was for tortious interference with gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.050" offset="14524683">That, indeed, may have diminished the amount or may not have since J. Howard was actually quite an active man at the time that he made this... this gift or intended to make the gift, and was still doing business deals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.823" offset="14575779">He may have increased his... his assets enormously at that point in time.</text>
