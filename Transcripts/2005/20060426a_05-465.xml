            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="5.189" offset="173041">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="7.220" offset="181191">This case involves the somewhat murky concept of an association in fact enterprise within the meaning of section 1961(4) of title 18, which is the RICO statute, and actually the specific language in this case, which is reproduced in the petitioner's brief at page 2, is a group of individuals associated in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.662" offset="258932">In this case, there are two fairly obvious enterprises that one might have expected plaintiff to identify in this... in its... in their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.882" offset="295816">The first one is Mohawk Industries, which is their employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.602" offset="306683">That is a corporation, clearly eligible to serve as an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.134" offset="320790">But, of course, the problem is if you identify Mohawk as the... as the enterprise, you then cannot sue Mohawk as the person under this Court's decision in Kushner.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.777" offset="359451">And so Mohawk was an unattractive enterprise under... on that... because of that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.826" offset="383588">Second, there are the recruiting and temporary agencies which are likely corporations and certainly are legal entities and, again, are eligible to be enterprises within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.984" offset="424234">But, again, here the problem is that there is no indication that Mohawk in any way directs or conducts the affairs of those agencies, and therefore, under this Court's explicit holding in Reves, there would no... there would be no basis for liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.158" offset="480972">And so the plaintiffs have attempted to sort of move around those two substantial obstacles to stating a claim by laying the claim to what is called an association in fact enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.505" offset="534367">Their complaint at paragraph 76, which is on page 23 of the joint appendix, states this fairly broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.912" offset="563937">Mohawk has participated in an association in fact enterprise with third party employment agencies and other recruiters.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.289" offset="593508">The question is what is this enterprise and does it have legs for purposes of bringing a RICO action.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.292" offset="625482">In analyzing that question, it seems to me there are two subissues within that.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.261" offset="641364">The first one is whether or not the language of section 1961(4) precludes using the corporation as part of an association in fact enterprise because 1961(4) explicitly... or specifically refers to individuals, and everyone has recognized, including I think the respondents and the United States, that if... if it were clear that association in fact enterprises or that enterprises limited to individuals under these circumstances, given the structure of the statute, the corporation would not be permissibly brought in on this particular theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.831" offset="779604">So you have to get past whether or not that is a limiting principle under this definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.837" offset="883676">The question presented is whether a defendant corporation and its agents engaged in ordinary, arms length dealings can constitute an enterprise in light of the settled rule that a RICO defendant must conduct or participate in the affairs of some distinct enterprise and not just its own affairs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="764.377" offset="3209828">Because I think they viewed those as absolutely synonymous, Justice Alito, and... and the reason I think that is because we know that in some instances they use including but not limited to, which reflects that Congress recognized that includes in some contexts is an exhaustive listing, and I think they thought in some contexts, meaning 1961(4), that it was an exhaustive listing.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.383" offset="3301883">And also, it's important to look at the other definitions of 1961(4), and I think this is the most important element of the other side's submission in this case because they do no business with any of the other definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.181" offset="3345038">The Attorney General, the definition of property for forfeiture purposes, those are unquestionably exhaustive lists.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.308" offset="3373563">At least, that's the way I... we argued it.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.950" offset="3380146">They didn't respond to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.419" offset="3385998">And yet, those are introduced with the term includes.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.857" offset="3399686">So it strikes me that the best contextual evidence of what Congress intended here was that includes would be used exhaustively and that the use of individuals of associated in fact would be used as a limiting principle, not as part of an exhaustive principle that expands the scope of this beyond... beyond... into a realm where it becomes nothing but a mere conspiracy statute, which is what it is today under this... under this particular theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.221" offset="3509191">That's... unless there are further questions about the straight statutory interpretation question, then I would go to the second issue, which is assuming that corporations can, nevertheless, be involved in association in fact enterprises, does this state such a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.741" offset="3571258">And here, you have to go back to the Court's opinion in Reves, and in Reves, what the Court held is that liability depends on showing that the defendants conducted or participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs, not just their own affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.276" offset="3637400">Okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="872.120" offset="3640744">So it is an element of RICO liability that you have to distinguish the... the corporate defendant's affairs in that case and... and the affairs of the... of the enterprise in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.616" offset="9582765">It would mean that, for example, a drug dealer could not participate in a drug enterprise because he does what the enterprise does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.633" offset="9610873">Since all corporations are engaged in hiring activities, therefore, then no corporation or other business entity could ever be prosecuted or sued under RICO because that... there is overlap between what they do and what an enterprise does, the... if the enterprise is devoted to recruiting illegal workers for a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.824" offset="9691643">That just can't be what Congress had in mind, and it's not consistent with what this Court held in Turkette that a common purpose is required for there to be a RICO enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.280" offset="9733439">In conclusion, I do not believe that the Court should address Mohawk's first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.267" offset="9777325">I thought it was startling to return to that issue, that Mr. Phillips stated the reason that it was not raised below was because he knew that they would lose and Eleventh Circuit would rule against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.206" offset="9821106">But, nevertheless, he wishes it to be addressed by this Court and simply bypass the court of appeal in the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.958" offset="9852140">If there's no split below, then the question would not have been accepted for cert presumably, as has been pointed out, and it should not be entertained now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.335" offset="9889652">For the reasons stated, I believe that the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2489.176" offset="10108976">Our argument is that it falls within the usual background understanding of the term enterprise and that it's not excluded from the statute by operation of 1961(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.974" offset="10152234">To take the first point first, if Congress had not defined the term enterprise at all, but had used the term enterprise in 1962(c), this... the courts construing the provision would have had to determine whether the term enterprise was naturally encompassed... was naturally construed to encompass not simply discrete legal entities but collaborations between discrete actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.340" offset="10245648">And I think it's pretty clear that the term would have been construed to include such ventures.</text>

            <text syncTime="2641.988" offset="10720241">The second point I'd make is that the last of... I believe it's the last provision of 1961(4) is the definition of pattern of racketeering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.897" offset="10755872">And that definition is introduced by the word requires.</text>

            <text syncTime="2660.993" offset="10796310">And this Court in Sedima and then in H.J., Incorporated has attached significance to that choice of verbs and has explained that Congress' use of the word requires, rather than the verb means, implies that two are necessary but not necessarily sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.184" offset="10857018">So when we're construing a provision in which the Court has already recognized that, at least in some instances, Congress' use of varying verbs to introduce the different subsections will be taken as significant--</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.385" offset="11409874">They're not incorporated, but they function as unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3199.624" offset="12950785">Do any of the court of appeals opinions deal specifically with the peculiarity of this definition in which, although it starts out with the word includes, then follows a... a listing, A, B, C, and D, and then it repeats one, but only one, of the items on the list and says groups of these items, i.e., individuals, are included?</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.474" offset="13038243">That's the peculiarity of the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.380" offset="13045870">Do any of the courts of appeals come to grips with that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3226.177" offset="13057051">I don't know of any court of appeals opinion that really focus on that... focuses on that aspect of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.788" offset="13083487">But... but, again, we can accept kind of the factual premises about what led Congress to draft the legislation as it did, namely that it anticipated the problem of groups of individuals banding together to commit criminal acts and didn't anticipate the problem of groups of corporations banding together for like purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.277" offset="13153390">But I think the whole point of having a template, having an established rule that means and includes, when they're used in the same statutory provision will be taken as meaning different things, as to give Congress a clue that if you've tried to list everything but you're not sure that you've got it all, here's the way that you can ensure that some new arrangement that would otherwise fall within the defined term is not going to be knocked out, and if you want it to be knocked out, use the words means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.751" offset="13255268">With respect to the second argument, that the... the core of petitioner's position is that it can't be held liable under RICO because it's simply conducting its own business, and I think that's wrong for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.769" offset="13303333">First, there's no rule that says a corporation can't simultaneously in a single act be conducting its own business and the business of a separate enterprise, and I think H.J., Incorporated is an example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.771" offset="13351399">The allegation in that case was that a utility corporation and its officers had engaged in a systematic pattern of bribing the members of a public utility commission to allow the corporation to charge higher rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.228" offset="13397165">And the suit was allowed to go forward on the theory that through the pattern of bribery, the utility was, in practical terms, participating in the conduct of the public utility commission's affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.933" offset="13444081">Now, clearly in attempting to bribe the utility commission members, the utility was, in a sense, conducting its own business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.934" offset="13476055">That is, viewed at a high level of generality, efforts to persuade rate setting bodies to allow a utility to charge higher rates are an integral part of the utility's own business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.562" offset="13514507">That didn't prevent it from simultaneously being a means of participating in the conduct of a different entity's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.454" offset="13542092">And second, there's more alleged in this complaint, and I think some of the questions brought this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.502" offset="13558288">May I finish my sentence?</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.767" offset="13567379">There's more alleged in the complaint than simply the unlawful hiring of illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.597" offset="13586710">There are hiring inducement and transporting offenses that would constitute separate violations that are antecedent to but not part of Mohawk's business.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3367.709" offset="13623176">Thank you, counsel.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="3371.131" offset="13636865">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.085" offset="13648672">Justice Ginsburg, let me... let me try to justify having this issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.164" offset="13668943">First of all, 1292(b) has never been as narrowly confined as you suggest, and indeed, in this case, you know, what you're entitled to do is to bring up any issues related to the challenged order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.650" offset="13710948">And in this case we not only raise the RICO issue, but we also raised State law issues in the... in the Eleventh Circuit which were not within the specific grant and were entertained by the Eleventh Circuit because that's the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.248" offset="13761312">And then once you get past that, Justice Kennedy is absolutely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.498" offset="13774269">The issue is whether there's an order to be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.108" offset="13780747">There is no final judgment rule on claims coming out of the Federal courts of appeals, and therefore, it's... it's absolutely fair game.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.469" offset="13810213">And the issue is I... I submit, fairly subsumed within the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.578" offset="13826618">Justice Souter, you know, with respect to the ID cards, I think it's very important to recognize that for us to do our business, we have to have an ID card in order to fill out the forms necessary to satisfy the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.284" offset="13877400">So that... you know, those ID cards add nothing to the... to the conduct of our business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.177" offset="13897044">And, you know, Mr. Stewart just suggested that, well, but you know, we do go beyond that and that H.J. allows some a... a different analysis of this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.725" offset="13935183">But H.J. preceded Reves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.835" offset="13943647">This Court held in Reves that you have to distinguish between the activities of the enterprise and the activities of the defendant and... and they've never made any effort to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.681" offset="13983039">All they do is suggest we've engaged in wrongdoing, that our third party recruiters engaged in wrongdoing, and that we're a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.558" offset="14014491">There's nothing in there that remotely suggests that there is an existing enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.918" offset="14027970">With respect to the question of how to interpret this particular statute, Justice Scalia is absolutely correct that at the end of the day, this is at most an ambiguous provision, and if it's an ambiguous provision, we ought to be entitled to the rule of lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.093" offset="14084708">I didn't hear any adequate answer to Justice Kennedy's specific question about why do they use person in the subsection just ahead of it, if they really meant to embrace everything here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.219" offset="14125145">And it's no answer to say, well, enterprise is a term that could be... that has a general background.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.972" offset="14144163">Enterprise is the linchpin of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.893" offset="14155865">The notion that Congress didn't mean to very specifically and explicitly define enterprise here is absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.395" offset="14185854">Of course, it defined it, and it provided a very specific and detailed definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.302" offset="14205498">And it's not free for the Government or for anyone else then to come here and shunt aside that definition and say, well, we're just going to deal with background principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.804" offset="14235487">The truth is they're trying to write out of it groups of individuals acting in association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.742" offset="14259310">That language is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.525" offset="14266416">It was put there for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.572" offset="14274566">The Government concedes that it didn't... that it never... that Congress never had this issue in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.652" offset="14298912">How it can be then that this is not at least sufficiently ambiguous that you should construe it in our favor strikes me as... as very difficult to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.153" offset="14336946">And finally, I don't... I've never heard the expression RICOize before, Justice Breyer, but I... I embrace it wholeheartedly because that is precisely what we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.765" offset="14375399">These are enormous penalties that are imposed, and it's a statute that this Court has recognized in the past, even on its own terms, is very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.767" offset="14411343">Certainly there is no reason to take those terms and RICOize the... the breadth of corporate activity that the plaintiffs' complaint in this case would... would allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.691" offset="14451049">The Court should reverse the decision below and dismiss this complaint, just as the Seventh Circuit did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.973" offset="14472156">If there are no further questions, thank you, Your Honors.</text>
