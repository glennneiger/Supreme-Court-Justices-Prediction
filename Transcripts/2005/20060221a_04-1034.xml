            <text syncTime="14.783" offset="236013">This is a case of agency overreaching. In this case, the Corps and EPA pushed the very limits of congressional authority, contrary to the plain text of the act and without any clear indication Congress intended that result. They claim 404(a) jurisdiction over the entire tributary system, from the smallest [*2] trickle to the largest watershed, swapping in -- sweeping in remote, non-navigable wetlands 20 miles from the traditional navigable water. This limitless claim of jurisdiction shifts the Federal/State balance and raises significant constitutional questions. We believe this boundless interpretation is inconsistent with this Court's reading of the act in Solid Waste Agency.</text>

Petitioners' wetland is hydrologically isolated from any navigable water of the United States. Further, the State of Michigan, exercising the power specifically and traditionally reserved to it, undertook responsibility to regulate the waters at issue and pollution and, in doing so, issued petitioner a wetland permit. It is clear from the record in this case that there is no hydrological connection between the petitioners' wetland and navigable waters of the United States. Referring to the appendix filed, the joint appendix filed in this case, specifically beginning with the EPA letters dating back to 1994, as this property has been under years of review, [*15] do not reference any such connection.</text>

            <text syncTime="3616.015" offset="14640976">And it's very clear that they understood that whatever scope of jurisdiction was given to the Corps, that it would bring along with it the adjacent wetlands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3653.946" offset="14792695">And so in the legislation that they proposed that eventually found form in 404(g), they expressly decoupled the 404 permitting process and its jurisdiction from the 402 process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.948" offset="14840760">Petitioners' argument, by contrast, necessarily restricts the scope of both of those programs because they are joined in the hip through 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.012" offset="14872943">And so if they're right that they can dredge and fill in these wetlands, then it is equally true that they can dump toxic materials into those wetlands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3980.000" offset="16096937">The one thing we know from Riverside Bayview is that it's not enough to simply say that your parcel of wetlands is not adjacent to the navigable waterway because in that case, as the Court remarked, it... the parcel ended before it got to the adjacent navigable body of water and there was another wetland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.880" offset="16168408">There was a continuation of the same wetland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.505" offset="16174991">Now, I don't know whether you'd call that two adjacent wetlands.</text>

            <text syncTime="4005.756" offset="16199964">But we know that the one wetland was covered because that was the holding of this Court in Riverside Bayview.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.398" offset="16218563">So I don't think I would give undue weight to that reading of it especially when, if you read it as I do, it makes perfect sense because a wetland adjacent to an otherwise isolated wetland is not going to have the same role to play in flood control in terms of monitoring the stream volume as a wetland adjacent to an otherwise regulable water body as you have at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.341" offset="16310305">And so I think that that regulatory decision that the Corps has made is one that's perfectly defensible and makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.326" offset="16338204">And I think that... again, I think one other point that I want to note that's kind of specific to this case is part of the reason why it makes sense to regulate a wetland adjacent to an otherwise regulable water body, even if there is a berm present, is illustrated by this case because, as was alluded to, the specific development plan at issue here... and this is clear at joint appendix pages 95 and 160... would sever the berm and create the hydrological link between a smaller, deeper wetland and the adjacent navigable wetland... waterway system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.053" offset="16473100">And so, I mean, it doesn't make a lot of sense, as Justice Stevens suggested, to have a regulatory regime where you have a regulable wetland after but not before a construction project that has the effect of vastly reducing the size of the wetland.</text>

            <text syncTime="4266.438" offset="17242667">That's all I was trying to establish.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.188" offset="17249668">You... you don't assert that that's an independent basis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="4270.532" offset="17259072">It is not an independent basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.392" offset="17262520">It is part of the reason why, though, in the context of wetlands in particular, a focus on physical proximity and adjacency makes sense and a fixation on hydrological connection does not make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.364" offset="17310377">Part of the reason you can look at the record here and find differing information about the extent of the hydrological connection is that is not a term that is relevant for the regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.162" offset="17349560">And the same thing was equally true in Riverside Bayview itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.507" offset="17366906">In fact, in Riverside Bayview, the district court made a finding that the wetland there was hydrologically isolated from the adjacent streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.118" offset="17397417">Now, as the Solicitor General pointed out in the petition at footnote 7 in Riverside Bayview, we think the best understanding of what was meant there was that there was no overtopping and that there was some drainage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.605" offset="17439317">But that just illustrates the point that hydrological connection is not a statutory term.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.997" offset="17460947">It's not a regulatory term.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.684" offset="17467634">It's a very loose term and it's not a term the Corps has ever used in regulating adjacent wetlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.201" offset="17489681">It's important to stress that the regulation for adjacent wetlands that is at issue here, subsection (7), is exactly the same regulation that was at issue in Riverside Bayview.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.406" offset="17530537">As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the Court, when it framed the question presented, framed it in terms of whether or not the Corps could rationally regulate wetlands that were adjacent to navigable waters and their tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.862" offset="17576408">And when they got to the holding, this Court approved the regulation and approved the fact that it asserted jurisdiction over wetlands adjacent to otherwise regulable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.379" offset="17614442">So if the tributaries are otherwise regulable because they are waters of the United States, it follows directly from Riverside Bayview that the adjacent wetlands are covered as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="4368.663" offset="17651536">You... you put a lot of weight on the tributary question in your approach by giving up the hydrological connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.585" offset="17679226">Your response is you don't need a hydrological connection because it's right next to a tributary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.353" offset="17694377">But for those of us who are having a little trouble with the concept of tributary, you don't leave us much to fall back on.</text>

            <text syncTime="4385.073" offset="17717260">Well, and... and I'm... I wish that weren't the case, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.621" offset="17735441">What I would say, though, is that this case has just not framed up the question of tributaries, and that's because... I mean, to put it more favorably to my client, the other side has never taken issue with the fact that their wetlands are adjacent to tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.248" offset="17785910">And I think that's... that's obvious for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4405.248" offset="17797926">I mean, first of all, if you look at the property in Carabell, it's just a mile from Lake St. Clair.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.608" offset="17815376">It's right next to a substantial drainage ditch which connects to a navigable water, Auvase Creek, and then into Lake St. Clair.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.985" offset="17844842">In fact, it's kind of ironic, but the property in Riverside Bayview was also a mile away from Lake St. Clair.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.987" offset="17864904">So it's very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.940" offset="17868666">If you look at the three sites at issue in Rapanos, one is right next to the Pine River.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.160" offset="17889564">One of the others... the whole point of the dredge and fill operation was to drain the wetland through the adjacent tributary systems so the water would go away.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.520" offset="17919030">And in the third one, there also isn't an issue about whether or not those are tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.523" offset="17935017">In a different case, that might be an appropriate focus for inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.367" offset="17950377">The last thing, I would say a couple of points before I sit down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.243" offset="17961871">I do think, first, that section 404(g) of the statute is very important because it is the clearest textual indication that Congress intended to regulate something beyond traditional navigable waterways and their adjacent wetlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.979" offset="18012862">And as this Court itself remarked in SWANCC, the single most likely candidate are the non-navigable tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.292" offset="18038044">The second point to emphasize is that the scope of the Corps' 404 jurisdiction is the same as the EPA's 402 jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.841" offset="18072316">They are joined at the hip through the basic prohibition under section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.140" offset="18089453">So a conclusion that somehow certain tributaries are excised from the tributary system for purposes of 404 is likewise excising those tributaries and creating a situation where you can have a... a free dump zone at some point above the... above what somebody might put as the limits of the navigable waterway system or the tributary system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.143" offset="18173463">And I think that is something that even the proponents of narrowing the Corps' jurisdiction in 1977 could not countenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.582" offset="18199272">The last point I would make is that there are going to be real-world consequences to contracting the jurisdiction of the Corps and the EPA to pre-1972 or, really, pre-1899 levels, especially for the downstream States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.274" offset="18254024">I think it's a bit much to ask a legislator in Wisconsin or in Minnesota to stop local development in order to protect the water quality and flood control propensities of the Mississippi River in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.541" offset="18299059">That's why it was manifest in 1972 that there was a need for a Federal solution to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.557" offset="18323196">That Federal solution includes as two of its most important components first getting at water pollution at its source, at the point source, and secondly, covering the tributary system without which the navigable waters will continue to be polluted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.937" offset="18380666">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="4564.205" offset="18433747">I'd be happy to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.580" offset="18439285">In... in Solid Waste Agency, this Court looked at 404(g) and determined that it had... it was not enlightening as to the meaning of navigable waters under 404(a) because Congress did not define other waters in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.959" offset="18508770">And this Court likewise concluded that 404(g) was simply not before it and would not draw any conclusions from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.132" offset="18537400">So I submit that it is really irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.368" offset="18546387">I note... I want to draw this Court's attention to our footnote 1 in our reply where we point out that... that in every formal rulemaking, the Corps and the EPA have excluded drainage ditches from the definition of tributary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.997" offset="18616917">It is here and now that these agencies are redefining the term tributary to include anything in the hydrological chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.795" offset="18660072">The Sixth Circuit decision says that any hydrological connection suffices as a significant nexus to bring in wetlands under Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.064" offset="18709182">Of course, in... in page 31 of the opposition, the Government argues that neither the directness... excuse me... nor the substantiality of a tributary's connection to traditional navigable waters is relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.787" offset="18780026">It's simply not true that the Government is only identifying channelized conduits as tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.522" offset="18815030">Anywhere water flows is a tributary in their book.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.273" offset="18826001">Let me also address something that this Court did in SWANCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.930" offset="18844600">It was not the lack of a hydrological connection in that case that informed this Court's decision to exclude those isolated ponds from Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.262" offset="18897995">It was the fact that those... that the regulation of those isolated ponds did not meet the terms of the act and there was no clear indication Congress intended to regulate isolated ponds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.139" offset="18949508">I submit that's this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.109" offset="18957345">In this case, there is no clear indication that Congress intended to regulate wetlands 20 miles from the nearest navigable water.</text>
