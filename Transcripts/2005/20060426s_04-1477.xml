            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="88729">I have the opinion in 04-1477, Jones versus Flowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.607" offset="115060">Gary Jones bought a house in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.884" offset="136167">He lived in the house with his family until he and his wife separated in 1993.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.554" offset="158842">Mr. Jones then moved into an apartment across town, and his wife continued to live in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.809" offset="183919">Mr. Jones paid his mortgage every month for 30 years, continuing to make the monthly payments even after he moved out.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.959" offset="212549">He paid off the mortgage in 1997.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.240" offset="225611">During these 30 years, the mortgage company took care of paying the property taxes pursuant to the usual escrow arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.291" offset="253823">After the mortgage was paid off, the property taxes went unpaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.678" offset="275348">Following Arkansas law, the State sent a Certified letter to Mr. Jones at the property’s address.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.796" offset="299903">The purpose of the letter was to notify Mr. Jones that he had two years to pay his back taxes, and if he did not, the State would get its money by taking his house and selling it.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.387" offset="342221">Nobody was home to sign for the letter when the postman came to the door, and nobody appeared at the post office to retrieve the letter within the next two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.370" offset="378166">The post office returned the letter to the State marked “unclaimed”.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.825" offset="403975">For the next two years, the State made no further effort to contact Mr. Jones, even though it knew that he had not received the letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.869" offset="436158">As the two-year redemption period came to an end, the State published notice of its plan to sell Mr. Jones’s house in a local newspaper, and the State eventually sold the house to Linda Flowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.696" offset="483491">When Mrs. Flowers tried to evict the Jones family, Mr. Jones’ daughter called him and told him what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.516" offset="514734">Mr. Jones sued the Commissioner of State Lands and Mrs. Flowers in Arkansas court, arguing that the State had not done enough to try to notify him before taking and selling his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.248" offset="561650">The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled against Jones, and we granted review.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.417" offset="586309">The Constitution says that a State may not take a person’s property without due process of law, and one component of due process is notice of the impending taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.048" offset="628837">Fifty-six years ago, we decided an important case, Mullane versus Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust, which said that in determining whether a state’s attempted notice was adequate, we should ask what would a person who actually wanted to inform the property owner of the proceedings against him have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.067" offset="712951">We conclude that someone who actually wanted to alert Mr. Jones that he was in danger of something as drastic as the potential loss of his house would not have simply given up when the Certified letter was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.265" offset="761748">The State should have taken further steps to notify Mr. Jones that he was in danger of losing his house if any reasonable steps were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.845" offset="796020">We are confident that there were several relatively easy steps the State could have taken here:  resending the letter by regular mail, posting notice on the property or trying to notify the current occupants, as well as Mr. Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.278" offset="853803">There is no reason to suppose that the State will ever be less that fully zealous in its effort to secure the tax revenue it needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.089" offset="881075">The same cannot be said for the State’s efforts to ensure that its citizens receive proper notice before the State takes action against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.257" offset="913676">In this case, the State is exerting extraordinary power against a property owner, taking and selling a house he owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.301" offset="941888">It is not too much to insist that the State do a bit more to let him know about it when the notice letter addressed to him is returned unclaimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.255" offset="977728">For reasons stated more fully in an opinion filed this morning with the Clerk, we therefore reverse the judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court; Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Scalia and Kennedy have joined; Justice Alito did not take part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
