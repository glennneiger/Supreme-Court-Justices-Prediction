            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="88442">We have a per-curiam opinion to announce in No. 04-1581, Wisconsin Right to Life, Incorporated, versus the Federal Election Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.050" offset="136612">The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 prohibits corporations from using general treasury funds to pay for electioneering communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.581" offset="178721">These are defined to include broadcast advertisements within a certain period of an election that mention a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.473" offset="210277">In 2004, Wisconsin Right to Life wanted to run television ads asking Wisconsinites to tell their Senators to oppose the filibuster of judicial nominees.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.544" offset="254581">The advertisements were covered by the definition of “electioneering communication”, because they included the name of a Senator up for re-election and were going to run within 60 days of the 2004 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.175" offset="305049">Wisconsin Right to Life brought suit in Federal District Court, arguing that applying the Act its advertisements violated the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.612" offset="338800">The District Court rejected this claim, because it considered the argument foreclosed by one of our prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.570" offset="370669">The lower court misinterpreted that prior decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.654" offset="382999">In that case, we considered to facial challenge to the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.292" offset="405569">But in deciding a First Amendment facial challenge, we strike down a statute only if it is unconstitutional in a substantial portion of its application; otherwise, we uphold the statute against the facial challenge and leave it to future as-applied challenges to address whether the statute is unconstitutional in particular applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.211" offset="493235">The Government argued that the lower court, after determining that the as-applied challenges were foreclosed, also held that Wisconsin Right to Life’s as-applied challenge must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.614" offset="542868">We do not think it clear that the District Court intended its opinion to rest on this alternative ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.291" offset="569513">We, therefore, vacate the judgment and remand the case to the District Court to consider the merits of Wisconsin Right to Life’s as-applied challenge in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.669" offset="611100">This per-curiam opinion is unanimous.</text>
