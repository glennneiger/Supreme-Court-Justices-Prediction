            <label>Justice Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="88786">Justice Stevens has the opinion in No. 04-885, Central Virginia Community College versus Katz; it will be announced by Justice O’Connor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="10.877" offset="132254">Since Justice Stevens is not with us this morning, I announce this on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.415" offset="162347">The case comes on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.135" offset="185230">We granted review to decide further the Bankruptcy Clause of the Constitution gives Congress the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity in bankruptcy proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.673" offset="235385">The debtor here, Wallace's Bookstores, had had dealings with a number of Virginia State agencies before going into bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.548" offset="274882">Once the bankruptcy petition was filed, Bernard Katz, the court-appointed liquidating supervisor, brought actions against the state agencies to recover preferential money transfers made to them by the debtor on the eve of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.278" offset="353877">The Bankruptcy Court, the District Court and the Court of Appeals all rejected the State agencies’ argument that the Eleventh Amendment rendered them immune from the recovery actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.786" offset="403927">In an opinion authored by Justice Stevens and filed today with the Clerk of the Court, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.867" offset="432244">Bankruptcy involves the marshalling of the debtor’s assets, the equitable distribution of that property among creditors and the ultimate discharge that gives the debtor a fresh start.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.868" offset="480205">At its core, bankruptcy jurisdiction is in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.267" offset="497759">As such, its exercise does not implicate state sovereign immunity to the same degree as other kinds of jurisdiction, even when the state’s interests may be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.866" offset="552198">The history of the Bankruptcy Clause and the bankruptcy legislation enacted soon after its ratification reflect the framers’ understanding the Congress could authorize bankruptcy courts not just to render in rem adjudications, but also to issue compulsory orders in aid of those adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.636" offset="635268">The peculiar nature of bankruptcy jurisdiction, combined with the history of the bankruptcy power, persuades us of the following:  the states agreed in the plan of the convention not to assert sovereign immunity in proceedings like those at issue here, proceeding seeking turnover of preferential transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.941" offset="724502">We do not rest our decision on any express statement Congress has made on the subject of state sovereign immunity; the relevant abrogation is the one reflected in the plan of the convention, not by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.930" offset="780404">Congress may at its option either treat states like other creditors insofar as concerns laws on the subject of bankruptcies or exempt them from operation of those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.701" offset="831499">The opinion is joined by me and by Justices Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer; Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion, which the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy have joined.</text>
