            <text syncTime="10.129" offset="194229">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="12.316" offset="203006">In 2003, this Court, through all appearances, brought this case to an end by holding that all of predicate RICO counts found by the jury must be reversed, that the liability judgment must be reversed, and that the injunction must be vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.143" offset="266327">On remand, however, a panel of the Seventh Circuit found a way to keep this case alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.318" offset="287015">It held that four of the 121 RICO predicates somehow survived this Court's decision, and it strongly suggested that the Hobbs Act punishes acts or threats of physical violence that have no connection to either robbery or extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.472" offset="343649">Today, we are asking this Court to reverse the erroneous decision below and remand with very explicit instructions that judgment be entered in favor of Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.981" offset="381683">Reversal is warranted because of three separate legal errors made by the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.340" offset="407074">First, the lower court failed to obey the clear holdings and remand instructions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.774" offset="428808">Second, the Seventh Circuit erroneously held, in conflict with two other Circuits, that the Hobbs Act plausibly can be read to cover freestanding acts or threats of physical violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.346" offset="471127">And, third, the Seventh Circuit erred in its previous decision, in 2001, in holding that the racketeering law, RICO, authorizes private injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.728" offset="552629">Because of what the Seventh Circuit also said, that a new trial is not in the cards and the damages verdict is gone and nothing more remains to be done except for the two issues that it outlined, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.016" offset="601843">If the Court rules in our favor on any issue, the case is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.265" offset="614800">Let me turn to our first point.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.150" offset="622323">The Seventh Circuit's decision is inconsistent with this Court's previous holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.923" offset="641445">This Court's 2003 opinion left no doubt that, quote, RICO predicates must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.247" offset="674777">But--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="130.811" offset="676971">Yes, but there was a theory that was put to the jury... and it's right there on the special interrogatories... one category was violent acts that obstruct commerce with no connection at all to extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.972" offset="745621">That was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.848" offset="753144">And I have a question about your characterization of what the Seventh Circuit did.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.901" offset="773311">It was puzzled.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.035" offset="777909">It says, "Extortion, they all go".</text>
            <text syncTime="158.463" offset="787626">But here are these four that don't involve extortion, and there's no ruling from the Court on those.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.724" offset="816674">Was the Court supposed to assume that the Court made a question... decided a question of statutory interpretation by silence?</text>

            <text syncTime="176.237" offset="858679">No, Justice Ginsburg, but the argument was made in this Court, at the petition stage the last time around, that those four counts were, in fact, included in the petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.454" offset="895564">At that time, of course, there was no contrary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.933" offset="909461">The Yankowski opinion of the Ninth Circuit made clear, and I think the language of the Hobbs Act makes clear, that freestanding acts or threats of violence are not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.149" offset="942375">So, we argued, at the petition stage, that those counts were covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.363" offset="959198">And then, at the merits stage, the Petitioners asked this Court to reverse and remand for entry of judgment in our favor on all claims and all counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.909" offset="1281340">It may have thought that those issues... those other acts were overlooked, and, therefore, they had some right to deal with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.286" offset="1342885">--I'd be happy to move on, Justice O'Connor, to those two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.065" offset="1353961">Our second argument is that the Hobbs Act does not punish freestanding acts or threats of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.611" offset="1376217">By "freestanding", we mean unconnected to either robbery or extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.693" offset="1392518">And I think that's apparent from the language of the Hobbs Act, which has three clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.410" offset="1415401">And the third clause covers acts or threats of violence, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="320.076" offset="1434000">"in furtherance of any plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section. "</text>
            <text syncTime="324.991" offset="1453749">unquote.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.582" offset="1456047">So, there needs to be a connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.059" offset="1465974">There needs to be a violation of this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.378" offset="1475273">And our position is that that refers back to the principal offenses under section 1951, robbery or extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.028" offset="1505889">Now, the Respondent's position is that the mere act of obstructing commerce, or affecting commerce, or, I suppose, even delaying commerce, is a violation of the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.089" offset="1546118">And I don't think it's possible to read the statutory language that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.339" offset="1559074">So, we think that argument is clearly foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.135" offset="1570255">Now, if there's any doubt about that, based on the language of the Hobbs Act, as amended in 1948, one need only look back to the 1946 version of the Hobbs Act, as originally passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.190" offset="1614454">And there, it... there's no debate that Congress intended to cover acts or threats of physical violence only if undertaken in furtherance of a plan or purpose to commit robbery or extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.140" offset="1654264">So, Respondent's position rises or falls on the proposition that in 1948, when Congress recodified and revised all of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, it dramatically expanded the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.554" offset="1715913">This Court, in reviewing revision and recodification statutes, applies special rules of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.690" offset="1748514">It requires the clear statement... or clear expression of intent to make a substantive change; and, if there isn't one, it assumes that no substantive change was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.006" offset="1781742">If you look at the revisor's notes to section 1951(a) in the 1948 revision, it's clear that there is no intent to make any substantive change.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.484" offset="1819672">So, I think the Court really doesn't need to go any further on that second issue to rule in the Petitioner's favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1399.031" offset="5749847">This Court held, in the Cooper case, which is an antitrust case that was talked about in the Flamingo decision recently, the United States is not a person who is able to sue under the antitrust laws, because... the general background principle that the United States is not a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.078" offset="5814003">And we think it's highly relevant that, after this Court repeatedly held that private parties cannot get injunctive relief, that the United States cannot get damages under the antitrust laws, Congress, in the Clayton Act, passed two express provisions of Government damages action... that was in 1955, and now it's a treble damages action... as well as an express private injunctive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.080" offset="5906059">And, thus, there was this menu of remedies in the antitrust laws of express Government equitable, express Government damages, express private treble damages, and then Government damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.257" offset="5954751">But Congress, in RICO, only picked up two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.726" offset="5968648">It picked up an express, a right for the attorney general to seek injunctive relief and other equitable relief, and it picked up an express right for private parties only to seek treble damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.008" offset="6009817">In light of the holding after holding after holding, we identified six cases that were... that were rendered before the passage of RICO, and the Cooper decision, which said the Government cannot seek damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.924" offset="6057464">We think it's very clear that when Congress borrowed from the antitrust laws, but did not pick up those two express rights, that the governing principle is that when Congress borrows a statute that's been definitively construed, Congress adopts that judicial construction along with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.454" offset="6127577">And it's particularly relevant because of those two express provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.804" offset="12716913">The fact that it has to be a plan to obstruct or affect interstate commerce is an important limitation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.936" offset="12745438">And it's key to remember that this is the position that the United States Government took for at least 25 years... from the Franks case, in 1974, to the Milton case, in the Fourth Circuit in 1998, the Yankowski case, in 1999... and it hasn't had those effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.720" offset="12804580">But if it does, Your Honor, then the appropriate solution is for Congress to change the statute, but not for this Court to ignore the plain meaning of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.466" offset="12839584">The final issue that was presented concerns the RICO statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.277" offset="12854839">Here, section 1964(a) clearly authorizes courts to have jurisdiction to issue injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.268" offset="12882842">Unlike the Sherman Act provision that only authorized Government to seek injunctive relief, section 1964(a) allows Federal courts of jurisdiction, in any instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.485" offset="12919727">This Court has said, in many instances, as Chief Justice Roberts pointed out, such as Franklin versus Gwinnett County, that when Federal courts have jurisdiction, they retain equitable power unless Congress expressly stripped that authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3427.355" offset="13863166">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.170" offset="13870375">I just want to make a few very quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.167" offset="13878421">First, I heard Mr. Chemerinsky say that the third clause was unnecessary in the Hobbs Act, because robbery and extortion necessarily involve acts or threats of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.007" offset="13921784">I just would like to point out that the Hobbs Act also covers official extortion, which does not require acts or threats of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.157" offset="13946340">Secondly, on the Enmons point that Justice Breyer was asking about, you're quite right, Justice Breyer, that to accept the other side's position would effectively overrule Enmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.305" offset="13982911">Enmons did not rely, in any way, on section 1951(c), had nothing to do with the Court's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.606" offset="14012168">If you look at section 1951(c), which is reprinted in the Scheidler blue brief at page 2(a), you'll see that it just refers to some labor statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.223" offset="14046650">It says that the Hobbs Act is not meant to repeal, modify, or affect those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.960" offset="14069533">But those laws don't protect violent conduct, so that's a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.808" offset="14080922">And, number three, I'd just like to point out that in this Court's last decision in this case, the Court made clear that coercion is not covered by the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.129" offset="14122300">But under the Respondent's reading, some acts of coercion would, in fact, be covered by the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.223" offset="14142676">Finally, we'd just like to reiterate our request that, if the Court rules in our favor, it make very clear, in remanding the case, that judgment should be entered in favor of Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.740" offset="14176740">Thank you.</text>
