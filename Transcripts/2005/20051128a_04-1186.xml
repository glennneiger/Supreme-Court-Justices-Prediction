            <text syncTime="69.367" offset="424968">Well, it... it... I don't believe it is, Your Honor, because of the sequence of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.670" offset="454226">You have to start with the 1882 statute and what the Supreme Court has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.219" offset="468332">But... but I'd like to make a preliminary comment before I turn to the substantive points here, which is that nobody has ever suggested, not the Fourth Circuit and not the respondent, any reason why Congress would want the result reached by the Fourth Circuit, in... in 1887 or in 1948 or any other relevant time, to uniquely restrict the access of national banks to Federal diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.777" offset="582644">Indeed, the suggestion is incongruous that Congress would want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.059" offset="599780">National banks are, after all, federally created and federally regulated instrumentalities.</text>

            <text syncTime="121.373" offset="633008">Yes, they... they might have... they might have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.561" offset="641785">And I... I acknowledge that this consideration is not controlling, standing by itself, on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.948" offset="671251">That is, if the statute plainly and unambiguously called for such an implausible outcome, then we might have a debate about whether an absurd outcome that the plain language calls for is one that should be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.210" offset="720361">But this is a background consideration that I don't think the Court can put aside or deem irrelevant to the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.703" offset="758291">So the key holding of the Fourth Circuit was that the word located has an unambiguous meaning, and it's... that it's the one adopted by the Fourth Circuit majority and not by the Fourth Circuit dissent, the Fifth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Comptroller of the Currency, or anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.029" offset="839584">The battle of the dictionary definition seems to me plainly inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.739" offset="862467">The biggest problem with the definitions is that they are cast in terms of the location of tangible physical things, a table, a lake, a piece of land; whereas we're dealing here with an incorporeal abstraction, a corporation, the location of which is not necessarily tied to any particular physical presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.838" offset="954836">Both we and the Government have given Ford Motor Company as an example in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.620" offset="973958">If you ask somebody where is Ford Motor Company located, I venture to say that most people would say Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.246" offset="996528">But when you stop and think about it, it's possible that it could be also located every place where it has manufacturing facilities or sales outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.332" offset="1036861">The only dictionary definition that I've seen that is specific to the location of an incorporeal entity, and specifically a bank, is the one that's cited in the Chase... JPMorgan Chase amicus brief, which was taken from the 1951 edition of Black's Law Dictionary, roughly contemporaneous with the enactment of current section 1348, which states that a bank is, quote, located, close quote, in the place specified in its organization certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.223" offset="1148351">The term also appears many places in the National Bank Act, sometimes meaning a specific headquarters location and sometimes meaning any place where there are physical facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.798" offset="1190670">And the Court... this Court itself has given located... the word located various meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.996" offset="1211463">In the Bougas case, which is much discussed in the briefs, the Court said that the term has no enduring rigidity, and the Court did not base its decision on the inherent or natural or ordinary meaning of the word located.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.381" offset="1269037">In Federal Power Commission v. Texaco, which is 377 U.S. 33, the Court interpreted the words in the venue statute for appeals from Federal Power Commission decisions which said the appeal could be taken to the place where the company seeking review was located.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.920" offset="1339150">Texaco said, well, we have substantial facilities in the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.941" offset="1351270">This matter that is the subject of this arose in the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.823" offset="1366839">And the Court looked at the statute and it said, no, located means where... your place of incorporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.106" offset="3371894">The 1882 statute unambiguously stated that the jurisdiction shall be the same as and not other than the jurisdiction for suits by or against banks not organized under any law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.712" offset="3430304">So the... the purpose of Congress was to... to give national banks access to diversity jurisdiction on the same basis as State banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.038" offset="3463636">And that... in the Leather Manufacturers Bank case, that was recognized by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.903" offset="3483071">Then in 1887, Congress went to a different wording totally.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.379" offset="3505014">It injected the word location.</text>

            <text syncTime="862.639" offset="3598010">This Court said no reason is perceived why it should be held that Congress intended that national banks should not resort to Federal tribunals as other corporations and individual citizens might.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.151" offset="3648061">It then said further on, on page 651 of 142 U.S., the clause was intended to have and must receive the same effect and operation as that of the proviso to the fourth section of the act of July 12, 1882.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.176" offset="3700201">And finally, they close by saying, no limitations in the regard of access to Federal diversity jurisdiction was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.146" offset="3732070">Then we have the 1911 codification, and in... and after 1911, we have several Supreme Court cases, including the Mitchell case, which again says that the codification worked no change.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.752" offset="3790480">It says, the Court held that as pursuits with... within the specified exceptions, national banks were, by the acts of 1882 and 1887, put on the same basis in respect of jurisdiction as if they had not been organized under an act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.715" offset="3850353">And then in 1948, you have the reenactment or the codification of the current judicial code, not intended to work any change in the meaning of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1199.071" offset="4943734">The paragraph that contained established and the paragraph that contained located were enacted in separate years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.374" offset="4969021">They concerned separate subjects, and they were always treated as separate provisions until the recodification of the judicial code in 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.288" offset="5000681">And that recodification stated in its explicit text that the provisions were... were to continue to carry the substantive meaning that they had beforehand and that the arrangement of the provisions were purely... was purely for convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.379" offset="5053030">And so I don't think it's fair to say that because established and located happen to appear in the same provision of section 1348 that they necessarily should be given different meanings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.789" offset="7258601">Wachovia, according to... I think we've got it in our papers that we filed in opposition to the petition... has 179 branches in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.836" offset="7290888">But it... but it is important, as... as you pointed out, Mr. Chief Justice, that a national bank is not a corporation, but it is a association formed under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.850" offset="7342924">So there's no State to which this Court can look or anybody can look to determine what their citizenship is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.335" offset="7456818">And that's what they did in 1448.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.595" offset="7465909">This Court, in a series of cases back in the mid-'80's, was faced with the... with the issue of how do you determine the citizenship of a corporation, and it went back and forth but finally came down with a doctrine that said a corporation will be deemed a citizen of the State in which it is incorporated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2911.646" offset="11794085">To say you can be a citizen of 40 or 50 States simultaneously, there really is no precedent for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.366" offset="11820939">I... I can't argue with you, but I... I still come back, you know, to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.308" offset="11844763">I... I think... I think the real problem here is that you've got a statute that was enacted in 1948 that really, if you go back and look, it goes back to 1911.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.089" offset="11895858">And obviously, in 1911, nobody knew the proliferation of branch banking that was going to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.903" offset="11923130">Nobody knew the proliferation of branch banking that was going to take place in... in 1948 when it was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.923" offset="11951238">And I think the real decision that this Court has got to make is whether you... you read the statute and apply it or either whether you're going to leave it to Congress to... to make that change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.775" offset="11994601">I'm not... and... and you may... you may apply it the way I'm arguing, and I hope you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.151" offset="12016126">And it may be... and... and if you do, then the national banking associations, with all the clout they've got, can go over here across the street to Congress and they can get it changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.775" offset="12058549">And you can bet they probably will be trying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.964" offset="12067326">But I think the real question is... is are you going to read the statute for what it says or are you going to, you know, give it the reading they want by going back in all this history and twisting and turning to get to the point they want to get to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.920" offset="12135140">They even... I think this is one point I want to make is if you look at their brief, right at the last page of their brief... and I think this highlights the... the problem that you've got is they say you don't need to go so far as to determine two places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.913" offset="12235137">They just want you to determine one place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.567" offset="12245795">And I think that highlights the fact of how far they're trying to stretch the rubber band on this word to... to get the... get the meaning that they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.113" offset="12295950">They... they say that ought to be left for another day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.145" offset="12312041">And so I come back that the... the ordinary meaning of the word located should... should put it in each State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.408" offset="12361151">The... I... I think this... I come back and I think the statute is unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.200" offset="12400335">And that leads me to the... the Bougas case, which was talked about a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.476" offset="12421442">It's not very often that you have a statute where this Court has already ruled, as it did in Bougas some 28 years ago, a... a virtually identical statute dealing with the banking laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.844" offset="12478911">They... they try to say, well, the in pari materia doctrine ought not to apply, but I mean, you've got a statute there that's a... a banking statute, admittedly dealing with venue, where this Court found the same meaning that we would like for it to find here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.116" offset="12547979">The courts... and... and their argument about established and located completely goes away because the Court said whatever the reason behind the distinction in those two words, it does exist and we recognize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.357" offset="12604926">And... and even if you say, well, in pari materia doesn't apply... and that's what they argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.777" offset="12630630">Judge Luttig said, well, it... it's... still there's some authority that similar statutes should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.197" offset="12656335">And here, we have a decision that's construing an almost identical statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.090" offset="12675875">It reaches the conclusion that... that we would like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.372" offset="12693011">In summary, kind of the way I look at it it's kind of like in 1948 the Congress tailored a citizenship suit of clothes for national banks, and... and that suit of clothes, a pattern of which was laid out even back into the... the 19th century, still fits the bill today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.283" offset="12776603">It's old.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.937" offset="12787261">It's a 57-year-old suit of clothes, and... but it still... it can still work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.580" offset="12809830">It may not work the way the banks want it to work, but it will work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.068" offset="12831773">And if the banks want to get a new suit of clothes for jurisdiction, then they need to go over across the street here to Congress and let it make that enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.242" offset="12872420">If you have no further questions, that concludes my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.867" offset="12910977">I just have a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.294" offset="12916724">One is with regard to the spread of national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.443" offset="12929262">There is a comparable spread of State banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.948" offset="12939293">For instance, Sun Trust is a bank that's comparable in scope to Wachovia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.469" offset="12953399">It has operations in many States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.729" offset="12962386">It has many branches, I assume, in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.351" offset="12972939">And yet, it is a citizen only of its home State, its State of incorporation, or principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.465" offset="13005331">If there were a problem of abuse of relocation, which I think the Court was a little bit worried about, Congress would deal with it the way they dealt with the abuses of corporate... stated place of incorporation by passing 1332(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.456" offset="13057367">So let me--</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.733" offset="13062382">No, but if there were the problems that you hypothesize here, Congress could have dealt with them by enacting something that dealt with the proliferation of branch banks rather than interpreting the 1948 statute in light of 1980's--</text>
