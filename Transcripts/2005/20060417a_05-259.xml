            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="7.308" offset="182022">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="9.489" offset="190799">There is no more vexing set of issues in the employment discrimination context than arise out of issues of retaliation under section 704 of title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.087" offset="233117">As the Solicitor General's brief and a couple of the other amici briefs point out, the number of... the number of these claims has increased by more than 100 percent over the course of the last decade, more than 30 percent of the EEOC's docket is now made up of retaliation claims, and the cost of an average contested retaliation claim exceeds $130,000 per case.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.041" offset="317022">Plainly, this is a fundamentally important question, and the standard to be applied under section 704 is critically important to both employers and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.807" offset="352027">And the respondent has given you truly a choice and not a shadow in this particular case because the respondent's analysis of section 704, based essentially on the language, any discrimination, is that everything that is in any sense against an employee, any act of retaliation, no matter how trivial, is nevertheless a basis for a section 704 lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.120" offset="441261">This is a position that's embraced by none of her supporting amici.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.673" offset="455471">It's a position that's been embraced by no court of appeals up until this point, and it is a position that is utterly untethered in the relationship between section 704 and its language and section 703, which is the heart and soul of the antidiscrimination norms in title VII.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="92.353" offset="522240">It has been endorsed by the EEOC, though.</text>

          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="95.475" stopTime="216.827">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="95.475" offset="534675">Not... not that broad... no, not even the EEOC in its most aggressive interpretation, which obviously the United States has rejected in this case, ever went to the point of saying any.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.852" offset="572187">And I'll give you a good illustration of that because in the guidelines, the commission always said that in a situation where there was absolutely no question of retaliation, charge filed against a supervisor, supervisor disinvites an employee to lunch, a lunch that's held with all the other employees... it has always been the position of the... of the EEOC that in that circumstance, that would not be enough to raise even a fact issue to go to a jury on.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.437" offset="670616">Under the respondent's theory of this case, it is clear to me that being disinvited to a lunch would, in fact, be a basis for a Federal lawsuit under section 704.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.114" offset="705307">So there is no one, neither governmental nor nongovernmental, that has embraced the extreme position that the respondent has put forward under section 704.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.860" offset="740206">And indeed, it's very difficult for me to understand why Congress would ever have adopted a rule that was more protective of those against whom... against... where retaliation takes place as opposed to the core of who was protected by section 703, which is the people who are in the protected class in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.592" offset="811155">To adopt the rule, I think, of the respondent in this case would not only increase the number of claims another 100 percent, at least, in the future, but it seems to me would render completely meaningless the observation of this Court in Weber that management prerogatives are to be left undisturbed to the greatest extent possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.214" offset="877715">There are no management prerogatives once an employee has filed a complaint under... and, therefore, is protected under section 704.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.129" offset="905300">At that point, everything becomes essentially a straitjacket problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.080" offset="921182">I don't think there's a rationale to support that interpretation, and so therefore the question is, what is the right standard under section 704?</text>
            <text syncTime="199.577" offset="951171">And here, it seems to me the United States and Burlington Northern are on exactly the same page.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.339" offset="970188">We believe that this Court announced the appropriate standard under section 703 in dealing with harassment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.172" offset="993489">That's the Ellerth standard, and we believe that the Ellerth standard is the proper one for defining a tangible employment action.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="216.827" offset="1020134">But 703 has the language and 704 doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.370" offset="1034345">I mean, 703 has language limiting it to... to employment, prerogatives of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.303" offset="1062035">704 doesn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.356" offset="1078231">Justice Scalia, this Court has also said that that negative pregnant has never been used as an overarching interpretive guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.413" offset="1102472">You have to evaluate 703 and 704 in tandem, and it seems much easier to interpret 704 as simply using discrimination against as a shorthand for the wide range of discriminations that are outlined in 703.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.610" offset="1155240">It seems quite cumbersome, at a minimum, and probably worse if Congress were to actually sit down and try to rewrite every aspect of 703 in order simply to say in addition to the protected classes that 703 protects, there is certain conduct under 704 that we protect in exactly the same way that we protect--</text>

            <text syncTime="272.605" offset="1243220">It would have said any... any act that is discrimination under 703.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.888" offset="1316363">And... and again, you... you still run into the same problem, Justice Scalia, as to why is it that Congress would want to protect more thoroughly 704 plaintiffs than it would 703 plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.885" offset="1356382">And it seems to me there's no--</text>

            <text syncTime="303.499" offset="1366831">Well, the answer would be because Congress is worried that people won't complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.462" offset="1386685">That's why.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.455" offset="1394626">And there are millions of ways of harassing people.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.545" offset="1402985">They start issuing a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.566" offset="1411031">You do all kinds of things.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.630" offset="1427331">You... I mean, it's easy to think of things that don't rise to the level of the... Ellerth.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.104" offset="1453245">So, I mean, if I... maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but if I'm right, why not just take, say, the D.C. Circuit standard?</text>
            <text syncTime="331.967" offset="1480725">They... they say that you have to show that the employer's action would have been material, which means the action might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.408" offset="1542479">Now, how about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="348.629" offset="1547285">That has the virtue of allowing a person not to be harassed, et cetera, who wants to make a complaint, and it also allows the judge to focus on the particular case and see if what the person is doing is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.367" offset="1598276">It holds the complainant to a standard of reasonableness, which is common in law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.555" offset="6739070">And here, we think that Congress intended the courts to harmonize the standard for section 704, the anti retaliation provision, with the standard for section 03, the act's core prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.044" offset="6780970">Justice Scalia, it does... the section 704 does omit the phrase, terms, conditions of employment, but as we've explained in our brief, we think it is reasonable to read the discriminate against as a shorthand for the unlawful employment practices identified in section 703.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.304" offset="6841992">It's also important to keep in mind that Congress knows how to write a broader antiretaliation statute when it wants to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2057.510" offset="8382903">Well, if you look at the text of 704(a) at the beginning of the caption, it says, discriminate in assisting, participating, or cooperating with enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2125.974" offset="8656667">What 704 was aimed at was allowing the law enforcement agency here, the EEOC, to have access to complaints about discrimination and witnesses, allowing the courts to have access to complaints and witnesses because without that free access and without 704 acting as a guardian around the primary rights, the primary rights would be eviscerated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3383.806" offset="13688059">There has been a rise in retaliation claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.988" offset="13700807">And, of course, it's complex what the reasons are, but anecdotally I can tell you a lot of it sits at the foot of Ellerth because employers establish policies, they publish their policies, they educated women and men about those policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.399" offset="13762456">People use those policies, and women who complain about sexual harassment, such as Ms. White, internally and then are retaliated against, when they go to the EEOC, they file a retaliation claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.327" offset="13810103">And there's been an increase of those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.177" offset="13817522">But if this Court applies a black line rule, a per se rule, where you say something is legal, that you can do what you did to Ms. White, then I'll have to advise individuals to go to the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.537" offset="13870916">There might be some retaliation and it's legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.609" offset="13887217">And a woman placed in a situation like that will not complain about sexual harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.383" offset="13914384">And the protection, the guardian that rule... that 704(a) has around the primary right will be eliminated, and the primary right will be adversely affected because women will no longer complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.505" offset="13978854">So whatever rule you apply, don't apply a black letter, per se rule because you're going to cause serious harm to the underlying primary rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.882" offset="14024307">If there are no more questions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="3475.256" offset="14053878">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.881" offset="14080314">Let me begin by focusing on the jury instruction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.006" offset="14092853">The jury was not instructed with the Ellerth standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.477" offset="14102675">There's a variant of the Ellerth standard, and it was not upheld by the court of appeals on the Ellerth standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.700" offset="14123573">What the court of appeals said was in the Sixth Circuit there is a unique circumstances standard that arises out of its particular way of analyzing these issues, and under that standard, it could be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.225" offset="14165682">And that was the same basis on which the district court at Pet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.036" offset="14176967">App. 118a upheld this particular verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.410" offset="14190446">So the question of the right standard to be applied and whether a reasonable jury could find it under these circumstances, Justice Scalia, is clearly presented in this case, and it's an issue that this Court still has to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.758" offset="14231824">Second, with respect to the suspension, the... the collective bargaining agreement specifically provides for discipline and then 15 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.313" offset="14266097">It's not a final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.763" offset="14271844">There's nothing in that collective bargaining agreement that says it's a decision of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.955" offset="14284591">To the contrary, the decision at the end of the... of the investigation is the decision of the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.530" offset="14310923">And we don't need a final employer action standard in order to prevail on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.251" offset="14329836">What we need is the opportunity to cure and a reasonable way under... under section 704, as the D.C. Circuit held specifically in Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.250" offset="14365780">And then finally, with respect to the observation about, you know, don't make any per se rules, well, the truth is there aren't going to be any per se rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.301" offset="14390022">There will be a lot of cases that get dismissed out under a tangible employment action theory because there aren't tangible employment actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.026" offset="14416876">But there will always be available the severe and... and pervasive standard, which is always going to constrain any employer from... from adopting those kinds of policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.763" offset="14455850">And the point that counsel made is that he recommends to every one of his employees... he probably should recommend two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.026" offset="14476957">One, you show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.937" offset="14480614">You ought to file a complaint about discrimination in the work place because under his approach, you will, therefore, be super protected under section 704 in a way you wouldn't have been by merely being protected under 703.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.905" offset="14528471">That cannot possibly be what Congress intended or what is helpful for the work place. The Court should reject that approach, should reject the Sixth Circuit's view, and remand. Thank you, Your Honors.</text>
