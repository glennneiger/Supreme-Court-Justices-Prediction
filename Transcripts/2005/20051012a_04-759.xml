            <text syncTime="7.321" offset="176402">The Federal Tort Claims Act waived the sovereign immunity of the United States for the torts of Federal employees when private persons in like circumstances would be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.652" offset="229692">But instead of applying private person principles of liability, the ninth circuit looked to the State and governmental entity principles of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.366" offset="276608">It concluded that the United States could be liable here, because Arizona has decided to hold its governmental entities liable when State employees are negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.914" offset="326763">That decision is wrong, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.383" offset="340660">First, it is contrary to the plain text of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.950" offset="362916">The Federal Tort Claims Act makes clear that the liability of the United States is to be judged by the principles of private person liability in the place where the tort occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.047" offset="415266">In section 1346(b)(1), the Federal Tort Claims Act allows jurisdiction and waives the sovereign immunity of the United States under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.786" offset="818283">You still would look to whether or not there is private... a private person analog.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.825" offset="874394">For example, if someone brought a trespass action against a Federal law enforcement officer for entering upon their land, you would apply the same State law as it relates to trespass claims against private persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.645" offset="929669">Those claims may, for example, have a defense of lawful authority to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.532" offset="949209">When looking at whether or not a police officer had... a Federal officer had lawful authority to enter, one might then look to Federal law to determine whether or not the officer had authority to enter, but you would still be applying the principles of private person liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.716" offset="1009917">If one concluded that there was no private person analog, then the only answer under the Federal Tort Claims Act would be that the United States cannot be liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.839" offset="1478449">In that situation, however, when one goes to apply the defense, it's just as one would if talking about a private security guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.374" offset="1512618">One would ask the questions whether the guard had the requisite authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.256" offset="1528082">And the State would look to what that guard's authority was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.944" offset="6174848">I'd like to begin by addressing the last point made by the Office of the Solicitor General, which is the Daggett case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.444" offset="6200866">And I address that merely to highlight that this is a State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.911" offset="6222704">It... the Daggett case did not hold, as the Solicitor General maintains, that under Arizona law there would be no duty under the restatement sections 323 or 324.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.959" offset="6274949">In fact, what the Court says in remanding the case because they found a duty under the county regulations, is,</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.857" offset="6310476">"We assume, without deciding, that there is a claim under 324 and... 323 and 324, and note simply that there are no allegations in the plaintiff's complaint that would satisfy those issues. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.577" offset="6377349">So, they simply say, because there's additional litigation coming, they were giving heads up to the party that he needs to amend the complain to assert the Good Samaritan elements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1695.536" offset="6929264">I hope that's clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.782" offset="6938250">But, generally, workers' compensation carriers have a right to get repaid if there's some private settlement, and concessions were made on this right, because of the... suing the parent company, and that case was never resolved on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.828" offset="12138394">It went off primarily under discretionary function, but then in addressing the Arizona... the Good Samaritan doctrine under Arizona, it relied on the Myers case, which is a case in which... the sixth circuit said that when you have the case... or safety inspections like the Federal... like MSHA, that court would adopt a actor, slash, monitor dichotomy so that there could never be an assumption of duty under... because the Government was only in a monitor function.</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.507" offset="12461163">If I may just start where he ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.425" offset="12472761">Just to be clear, Justice Scalia, the point that I was making is, the only private person law to which respondents pointed below was that of the Good Samaritan doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.758" offset="12518110">That... whether or not respondents can make out a claim under the Good Samaritan doctrine would require meeting all of the elements of that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.971" offset="12551024">That would be primarily a State law question, but we do think there's an ingredient of a Federal question there, especially, for example, in deciding whether or not they reasonably and detrimentally relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.394" offset="12604627">Other courts of appeals, including the sixth circuit, in Myers and Raymer, have said that the language of the Mine Act is relevant to whether or not a party can simply rely on the very... just the bare existence of the MSHA... of MSHA's existence and its inspections, and held that, given the language in the Mine Act that expressly leaves the safety of the mine to the... primarily to the mine operators through the assistance of the miners, that it would be unreasonable to rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.450" offset="12720925">Here, it... this was completely appropriately decided by the district court on a motion to dismiss, because they came forward with affidavits that say nothing more than that they relied upon the existence of the MSHA scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.431" offset="12776827">And that, under Arizona's Good Samaritan law in... taking into account the Federal scheme, is insufficient, because it is insufficient under Arizona law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.391" offset="13416618">I think if you say yes, you could look to that law and conclude on this record that there can't be liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.908" offset="13438769">Justice Ginsburg, if I may turn back to your point about Muniz, I think you're correct that they didn't specifically... the court in that case didn't specifically suggest what the private analog might be on remand, although it did suggest perhaps it would be personal injury law as it relates to private persons in like circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.233" offset="13500001">But I think the important point in Muniz on that point is akin to what I was just making to Justice Scalia, which is that the court said there is consent to sue here, so the prisoners may sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.757" offset="13546081">Whether or not they're going to be able to ultimately make out a claim under private person law is a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.263" offset="13568128">So, the Federal Tort Claims Act is not a guarantee of monetary compensation from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.634" offset="13597594">And one cannot do what the ninth circuit did, which is to keep looking for possible analogies in... under which the result would be that the United States is held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.600" offset="13633538">Sometimes, just like with private party analogs, just like with private safety inspectors, the answer will be the private party can't be held liable under the applicable private person law.</text>
