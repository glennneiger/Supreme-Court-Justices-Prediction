            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="88733">The second case I have to announce is Empire HealthChoice Assurance v. McVeigh, No. 05-200.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.188" offset="129484">The Federal Employee Health Benefits Act of 1959, which I will refer to as FEHBA, as its name conveys, establishes a health-insurance program for Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.048" offset="180893">The Act authorizes the Office of Personal Management, OPM, to contract with private carriers to offer Federal employees an array of healthcare plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.485" offset="234601">The most heavily enrolled plan for which OPM has contracted is the Blue Cross Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan, administered by local Blue Cross Blue Shield companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.814" offset="283920">This case concerns the proper forum for reimbursement claims, claims that arise when a planned beneficiary injured in an accident whose medical bills have been paid by the carrier recovers damages unaided by the carrier in a state-court tort action against a third party alleged to have caused the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.413" offset="378379">FEHBA contains a preemption clause under which terms of healthcare plans displace state law on issues relating to coverage or benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.851" offset="424041">The Act contains no provision on the subrogation or reimbursement rights of carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.266" offset="449745">Annually renewed contracts between OPM and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, however, have obligated the carrier to make a reasonable effort to recoup amounts paid for medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.073" offset="505020">The instant case originated when the administrator of a plan beneficiary’s estate pursued tort litigation in state court against parties alleged to have caused the beneficiary’s injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.450" offset="562490">The carrier had notice of the state-court action, but took no part in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.201" offset="581507">When the tort action terminated in a settlement, the carrier filed suit against the insured worker in federal court, seeking reimbursement of the full amount the carrier had paid for the worker’s medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.592" offset="631035">The question presented:  Does 28 U.S.C. §1331 authorizing jurisdiction over civil actions arising under the laws of the United State encompass the carrier’s action.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.730" offset="687564">In accord with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, we hold that §1331 does not cover the carrier’s suit for reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.866" offset="728106">FEHBA itself provides for federal-court jurisdiction only when a planned beneficiary disputes the denial of coverage or benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.293" offset="765827">Even though the Act makes no express provision for federal-court jurisdiction over reimbursement suits brought by carriers against planned beneficiaries, the carrier here urges that its suit belongs in federal court; that is, so the carrier maintains, because the entire scheme is pervasively federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.285" offset="853807">The master contract with Blue Cross is negotiated with a Government agency, OPM, benefits are paid from a fund maintained in the U.S. Treasury, and reimbursements are returned to that fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.796" offset="907829">On the other hand, the personal-injury suit that generated the settlement out of which the carrier seeks reimbursement has no federal element to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.716" offset="947535">Suits of that character are governed by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.157" offset="961327">The carrier here is essentially seeking a portion of the recovery gained in the state-court litigation, and such wrap-up claims are normally pursued in the court in which the personal-injury action is launched.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.534" offset="1018797">A carrier’s commencement of a separate federal case to reach the proceeds of the settlement can be costly for the injured worker, and we are reluctant to attribute to Congress a purpose unexpressed in FEHBA’s text to place such suits in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.708" offset="1083476">We do not read FEHBA’s preemption clause to open the federal-court door to a carrier’s reimbursement claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.772" offset="1111793">For one thing, that clause has a peculiar feature:  it makes contract terms in the Blue Cross plan preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.037" offset="1144811">Ordinarily, federal preemption provisions make federal laws, not termed in a contract with a private carrier, preemptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.230" offset="1181592">That unusual feature inclines us to read the clause modestly.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.268" offset="1201758">Congress no doubt could expressly provide that reimbursement claims of the kind here involved warrant the exercise of federal-court jurisdiction; but for reasons spelled out at length in the Court’s opinion, we conclude that the presentations made in this case fall short of demonstrating that a federal forum is available to the carrier here.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.867" offset="1292142">Federal courts should await a clear signal from Congress before treating a carrier’s suit for a share in a worker’s personal-injury judgment or settlement as a case arising under the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.025" offset="1348775">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit; the Chief Justice and Justices Stevens, Scalia and Thomas have joined this opinion; Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Kennedy, Souter and Alito.</text>
