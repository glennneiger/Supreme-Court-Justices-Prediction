            <text syncTime="11.854" offset="192918">In enacting the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress recognized that suits against Federal employees, based upon their official conduct, constituted a very real attack upon the morale of the Civil Service.</text>

            <text syncTime="28.163" offset="258224">First, it allowed plaintiffs to sue the United States directly, but secondly and importantly, it provided that a plaintiff who took up that opportunity, the judgment in the suit against the United States would constitute a complete bar to any action against the employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="60.522" offset="387582">And the Court has recognized in... in numerous cases that claims of official immunity are... warrant immediate appellate review because they can only be effectively vindicated by review at the motion to dismiss stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.436" offset="447246">And... and that is the kind of protection that section 2676 provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.652" offset="468144">It establishes that the judgment in the suit against the United States shall be a complete bar against any action against the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.198" offset="502312">So it's the action itself that is precluded, and it is precluded completely.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.216" offset="1010446">For example, res judicata would not bar a suit against another party that could not have been joined in the first suit, but by its plain terms, section 2676 would bar such a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.171" offset="1058198">Likewise, common law res judicata would not bar a second suit to... to recover a kind of damages that were unavailable in the first, but whereas punitive damages are unavailable in a suit against the United States, section 2676 would plainly bar a second suit against the employee to cover punitive damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.597" offset="6655925">And the purpose behind the bar generally is not the same as the purpose of qualified immunity because although the FTCA, in general, and the legislative history of the FTCA indicates that the act as a whole was intended to protect employee morale and distraction from employment, that's not the purpose behind the judgment bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.694" offset="7292268">First of all, the... the bar to State law tort suits is in 2679(b), which was passed in 1988, 42 years after the judgment bar and the... and the bulk of FTCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.864" offset="7345035">It was passed as an express effort to overturn this Court's decision in Westfall, which held that employees did not have immunity from State law... certain State law torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.379" offset="7391011">And in the findings that are incorporated into section 2 of the statute, Congress specifically called 2679(b) an immunity provision, and this Court has since recognized that, for instance, in Gutierrez de Martinez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.066" offset="7441793">There is no comparable legislative history indicating immunity for... for... under 2676.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.968" offset="7481395">So I... I don't think it's that complicated to figure out now whether someone is proceeding... whether the claim arises... whether the claim to appealability, whether the defense arises under 2679(b) or under the judgment bar because they just really get at very different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.771" offset="7552657">And the courts haven't shown... there's not a lot of case law in either direction, but the... the courts haven't exhibited much confusion about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.731" offset="7580451">The other thing is that when you're... when you're construing the scope of the judgment bar, it's important to remember that this was passed in 1946, and it was intended... at that time some 25 years... 35 years before Bivens, what the... what Congress was getting at was State law suits against the employees versus State law suits against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.635" offset="7680030">And the effort was to shift the liability to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.277" offset="7694658">That effort to shift liability, yes, was for morale, to protect employees from being distracted, but that... that was, again, the purpose of the shift of liability, the waiver of sovereign immunity in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.028" offset="7749620">The only real explanation of the judgment bar appears in the background of where the drafters explained that the bar is intended to... as a bar to... bar to further suit not only against the Government, as would have been true under the prior bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.038" offset="7841675">This is around page 14 of my brief, the quote from... from the 1945 report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.245" offset="7866544">Not... a bar to liability not only against the Government, as would have been true under the prior version, but also against the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.477" offset="7895488">And there was no bar to suit in the prior version of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.119" offset="7910012">So the drafters' explanation could only have been referring to the normal operation of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.338" offset="7934880">And this Court has used res judicata in Digital as sort of the quintessential example of a defense that is not subject to immediate appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.778" offset="12400670">I think the end of the matter is actually a phrase that the Assistant Attorney General uses in the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.415" offset="13395204">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.069" offset="13401786">First, I think it's important to note that respondents concede that the Westfall Act confers a form of official immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.755" offset="13436582">That statute, like 2676, does not use the word immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.841" offset="13456853">Rather, it uses the word, any action related to the same subject matter is precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.808" offset="13480781">And that is virtually indistinguishable from the language of 2676 that... that establishes a complete bar to any action by reason of the same subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.670" offset="13524248">So there is no requirement that Congress invoked particular language to create an immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.566" offset="13543788">The question is what are the underlying concerns that are protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.888" offset="13557058">And the respondents have admitted that 2676, like the Westfall Act, was intended to protect employee morale against the threat of personal liability when they were acting for the Government, as well as the distraction and cost of defending against suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.167" offset="13626231">This Court, in fact, in Gilman--</text>

            <text syncTime="3372.915" offset="13637202">The thing you haven't answered that I think is troubling everybody is why is... why is that... I mean, if you could come up with some explanation of why that concern for morale only arises after there has been a... a judgment in the suit against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.349" offset="13718913">Why... if that were the concern and if the Government wanted total immunity, why wouldn't they have extended it to a... a 1983 suit brought before the FTCA suit?</text>

            <text syncTime="3415.905" offset="13809192">But as Justice Stevens recognized, plaintiffs would want to sue the solvent defendant, and that's why the... making the Government itself subject to suit was part of the deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.731" offset="13856422">And... and Congress understood that plaintiffs were going to take up that option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.916" offset="13877215">And that's why, up until the... this Court's adoption of Bivens, there were virtually no decisions about 2676 because plaintiffs just didn't try.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.118" offset="13917966">This Court in Gilman, an early case relating to 2676, recognizes that... that the statutory provision was intended to address precisely these types of concerns, morale of employees, the same concerns that have led this Court and Congress in other contexts to recognize other forms of... of official immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.157" offset="14010126">And this one is equally subject to immediate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.818" offset="14024755">Respondents suggest, considering for a moment, what Congress would have expected in 1946 when it initially enacted this, and... and I think that that is helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.052" offset="14069790">There is... it is quite clear 2676 is explicit, that Congress did not expect the end of the litigation against the United States under the FTCA to mark the beginning of the litigation against the employee in his personal suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.236" offset="14130498">And... and respondents offer the example of the postal carrier as one of those quintessential cases that Congress meant to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.600" offset="14159964">But, of course, the postal exception to the FTCA, another exception in 2680, 2680(b), would bar many claims against the United States relating to a postal carrier's misdirection of the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.135" offset="14222031">Now, respondents would have the Court believe that if that suit was brought against the United States and the United States was found not to be liable because of that exception, that the plaintiffs were free... and Congress intended that the plaintiff be free... to then go sue the poor mail carrier himself personally.</text>

            <text syncTime="3537.101" offset="14293920">What about 2679(b)(2) of the Westfall Act which says the Government doesn't get substituted for the employee in a Bivens claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.559" offset="14331746">Westfall... the Congress was... was quite concerned, it seems, with preserving an action brought for violation of the Constitution of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3557.412" offset="14375213">With respect to section 2676, Bivens claims today, after the enactment of the Westfall Act, stand in the same footing as common law claims stood prior to the enactment of the Westfall Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.893" offset="14433101">In other words, prior to Westfall, you could bring a common law claim against an employee, but if you brought a suit against the United States, the judgment in that suit would bar the common law claim against the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.413" offset="14483151">In other words, the plaintiff had to make a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.487" offset="14491511">Likewise, when Congress enacted Westfall and said you no longer have a choice with respect to common law claims, those have to be brought against the United States, it left the plaintiffs with a choice with respect to constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.928" offset="14545218">They could choose to pursue a Bivens remedy, but if they sue the United States on those claims, the judgment and the action under 1346 would be a complete bar to any action against the employee.</text>
