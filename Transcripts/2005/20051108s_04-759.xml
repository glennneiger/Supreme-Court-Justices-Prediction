            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="10.778" offset="131730">The subject of this case is the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.809" offset="147821">It’s an Act that, by waiving sovereign immunity, permits an injured person to bring tort suits against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.871" offset="184079">It says that those tort suits can be brought, “under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable under state law”.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.121" offset="233085">Okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="37.573" offset="238936">The plaintiffs in this case are Arizona mineworkers, who say that the negligence of federal mine inspectors helped bring about the mine accident that seriously injured them.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.141" offset="293167">We are now reviewing a decision of the 9th Circuit on this matter, which held two things:  first, it said mine inspection is a, “unique governmental function”, a function for which there is no private-person analogy; second, it said that the mineworkers’ lawsuit can go forward against the United States anyway, because, it said, under similar circumstances a, “state or municipal entity” would be liable under Arizona state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.820" offset="435900">In our view, the 9th Circuit’s two holdings both depart from well-established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.114" offset="465052">First, the Act says the United States can be held liable if a private person would, in similar circumstances, be liable under state law; it doesn’t say if a state or municipal entity, under similar circumstances, would be held liable under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.950" offset="528478">And in 1955, a case in this Court called Indian Towing Company, the Court said the words mean what they say:  it’s tort law governing private people, not tort law governing state or municipal entities that has to determine liability under the Act, and we found no authority to the contrary, either in this Court or any other lower court outside the 9th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.184" offset="645402">The second, the 9th Circuit held there are no private-person analogies to the federal mine inspection; but Indian Towing said the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.921" offset="684272">That case involved a claim that the Coast Guard was negligent in failing to inspect a lighthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.518" offset="710708">The Court said that there is a private person to a lighthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.607" offset="727008">The private person is the person who undertakes a good-Samaritan obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.693" offset="747384">So if there are private-person analogies for lighthouses, we think there must be private-person analogies for mine inspections, private inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.817" offset="795867">Indeed, the Government concedes as much, and lower courts outside the 9th Circuit all have consistently found private-person analogies in similar circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.043" offset="840798">We consequently vacate the 9th Circuit decision, and we remand the case for further consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.525" offset="866711">The decision is unanimous.</text>
