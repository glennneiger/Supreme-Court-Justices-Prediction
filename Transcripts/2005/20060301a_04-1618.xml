            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="8.814" offset="171168">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="11.668" offset="182557">In this admiralty case, the Eleventh Circuit held that Chatham County, a political subdivision of the State of Georgia, is entitled to sovereign immunity in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.932" offset="227593">That is wrong for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.359" offset="237310">First, for well over a century, this Court consistently has held that counties and other political subdivisions are not entitled to sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.434" offset="273673">And second, in the specific context of in personam admiralty cases, the same rule has been recognized for over 100 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.353" offset="313274">To go to my first point, in Lincoln County v. Luning, decided in 1890, this Court squarely held that counties and other political subdivisions are not entitled to sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.700" offset="366668">There are three, or at least three, significant aspects of Lincoln County that bear emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.102" offset="392268">The first one is that even by 1890, the Court was able to say that in its own cases it could see decades of case law where counties had been a defendant without any objection being raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.860" offset="443364">The second was that an important aspect of the Court's reasoning was the recognition that when a county is sued, the State is not a real party in interest, not the real party in interest, which is another way of saying that the county is not an arm of the State, the issue before here us today.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.367" offset="573349">It is possible that the... that a... that a particular State would associate so closely with a county, so closely control its... its acts, and be on the hook for its liabilities, that under this Court's cases it could be an arm of the State, but that is not the case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.046" offset="700095">I'm not aware this county would meet that inquiry with respect to what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.667" offset="726531">What we have in this case is essentially two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.043" offset="744086">One is that the county, like every other county in the country, exercises a slice of State power, and that was something that was found unremarkable by this Court in Lake Country Estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.129" offset="788389">And the second one is that this county, like many other organs of government, may get funding, even substantial funding, from the State, and again, that was found unremarkable in Mt.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.819" offset="843142">Healthy by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.913" offset="847531">What is controlling here is that the county, like most counties or maybe all counties, enjoys a significant amount of autonomy, has the power under the State law to raise its own revenues through taxes and bonds, and that the State is ultimately not liable for its debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.958" offset="915762">And under... under those factors, the county is unable to meet any definition of arm of the State that has ever been articulated by this Court's cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.877" offset="955364">Is... is the failure to extend immunity to counties and municipal entities in a State just a historical relic?</text>
            <text syncTime="214.124" offset="992353">It depends on semantics.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.806" offset="1007086">Or is there some normative or good government policy that dictates the distinction?</text>

            <text syncTime="224.777" offset="1034985">Well, I think as a... as a fundamental feature of the Federal system and... and the plan of the Convention, that the States came together as sovereigns to form a new country, and under this Court's cases, the immunity that they retain is called residual because it is recognized that insofar as they did not relinquish it to the National Government, they kept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.542" offset="1126100">There is no historical record of the founding that contemplates that counties came to the Convention as sovereigns.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.098" offset="1404252">And you're right, Justice Scalia, that this has been reflected in... in the Federalist Papers, 81, by Hamilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.392" offset="1425464">It was clear, at least to some of the Founders, that this was a feature that need not be stated in the Constitution in order to recognized.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.473" offset="1457751">So it's a historical relic based on the dignity of the State, or the king in one case, and the corresponding lack of dignity of the entities on the other?</text>

          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="341.791" stopTime="429.415">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="341.791" offset="1503099">Well, it is... it is what the history was and what the plan of the Convention was, and it's also a recognition, even functionally, that we're talking about sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.878" offset="1543433">And I think most common sense understandings of what a sovereign is would imply at least the ability to prescribe law for the government of others without having to draw your authority for that from a higher source and without being accountable to a higher source.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.568" offset="1598185">A State within the respective sphere would meet that requirement, but that would not be true of counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.194" offset="1620651">I will point out, as my third point with respect to the Lincoln County case, is that the... the case came down March 3rd, 1890, which was the same day that the Court handed down Hans v. Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.979" offset="1675821">And that is significant because, as the Court is aware, the holding of Hans has been the subject of significant disagreement over the years since by members of past and current courts, and many members of the courts have viewed Hans as an unwarranted extension of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.451" offset="1745725">If the Court was not prepared to extend immunity to counties on the day that it ruled on Hans, it seems hard to see why it would do it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.921" offset="1775609">And in fact, the history of this Court's cases since then reflects an almost inflexible understanding, again and again, that counties and political subdivisions are not entitled to the State's immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.812" offset="1887099">With respect to my second point, Mr. Chief Justice, Workman v. City of New York squarely dealt with the question whether a political subdivision, a... a municipality made up of four counties in that case, was entitled to immunity in an admiralty suit in personam, and the Court concluded that the answer was no.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.661" offset="1982499">Now, the only argument I have heard for why Workman is not controlling in this case has been that somehow in Ex parte New York No. 1, this Court cast doubt on that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.423" offset="2029624">But if you look at the portion that is being relied on, all that the Court said in Ex parte New York was it cited one of the distinctions between the New York case and Workman, when it could have cited two.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.853" offset="2079361">That's not enough to override what the case actually says.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.636" offset="2094407">And one of the reasons that I started with the Luning County is that even if there were any doubt on the question or even if Ex parte New York have cast enough doubt under Workman, despite the uniform understanding since Workman that that's what the rule is, the fact that this Court in every other context of sovereign immunity has consistently held that counties are not entitled to sovereign immunity ought to be dispositive of the question there as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.866" offset="2503380">The main holding of the Ex parte New York No. 1 case is, indeed, that that limitation does not apply because, as understood by Hans, which had been ruled on some 31 years earlier, the sovereign immunity really comes from the structure of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.193" offset="2584673">And the state of this... this Court's doctrine is that the Eleventh Amendment's sole purpose was to overrule the holding in Chisholm, and that but for the fact that Chisholm came down, the Eleventh Amendment never... if the Eleventh... if the Eleventh Amendment had never been enacted, every sovereign immunity case would come out the same way.</text>

            <text syncTime="734.501" offset="3073895">States enjoy a constitutionally protected immunity from suit, but cities and counties do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.304" offset="3101166">That principle has been established by an unbroken line of precedent dating back to the 19th century and was applied to an admiralty suit more than 100 years ago in Workman v. City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.984" offset="3151844">Both Workman and the principle it applied answered the question presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.944" offset="3175668">Workman held that, as a matter of the Federal law of admiralty, a political subdivision is not entitled to immunity from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.362" offset="3217359">In the course of deciding that question, the Court explained that if the government entity defendant in an admiralty suit were a sovereign, it would be entitled to immunity, not as a matter of admiralty law, but as a matter of the law of sovereign immunity, in which case the Court would be without jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.263" offset="3292905">The Court went on to say, however... and this is at page 570 of the opinion... the municipal corporation of the City of New York unlike a sovereign was subject to the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.025" offset="3344001">Workman's holdings resolved the issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.891" offset="3359465">But the result would be the same even if Workman had never been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.839" offset="3375243">From the Lincoln County case in 1890 through the Richland County case in 2003, this Court has repeatedly held that States, but not cities or counties, are sovereign and that States, but not cities or counties, are therefore entitled to sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.823" offset="3451207">A city or county is no more a sovereign in an admiralty case than it is in any other type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.960" offset="3479733">The theory on which the court of appeals apparently relied was that not only States but what it called political subdivisions of States are entitled to sovereign immunity, at least when the... the political subdivision is exercising a power delegated by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.099" offset="3548278">But that's no different from saying that cities and counties are, after all, entitled to sovereign immunity because every city or county is a political subdivision of a State and every city or county exercises power delegated by the State, what this Court has called a slice of State power.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.665" offset="3622571">So the apparent rationale of the court of appeals is just flatly inconsistent with more than a century of this Court's precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.130" offset="3732389">So the only issue in this case is whether there is some other ground on which the county would be entitled to immunity, and there's none.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.694" offset="3762691">Respondent's theory is that there are two distinct notions of sovereign immunity, what it calls Eleventh Amendment immunity and what it calls residual sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.703" offset="3802711">A fundamental flaw in that theory is that there is only one doctrine of... of constitutional sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.370" offset="4525362">This Court's cases make clear that in deciding whether an entity is an arm of the State, there are three principal considerations to take into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.518" offset="4557963">You've identified one of them, which is the classification of the entity under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.661" offset="4578548">The other two, which are probably more important, are whether the State would ultimately be liable for a judgment against the political entity and also the extent of control exercised by the State over the entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.095" offset="4636331">It's important to point out, with respect to the latter of those two considerations, that control in this context doesn't mean simply that the county has been delegated authority by the States since, after all, all counties are... are delegated authority by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.775" offset="4683037">It means that there's more of a day to day control, for example, that it is the Governor who appoints the members of the commission that governs the particular entity, the Governor who has the power to remove them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.580" offset="4754195">The Governor may have veto power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.852" offset="4763286">That's the sort of considerations that courts have taken into account in deciding whether the control element of the arm of the State inquiry is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.843" offset="4803305">There is no basis for any notion of constitutional sovereign immunity beyond the one identified by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.241" offset="4836846">Consequently, there's no basis for any arm of the State test other than that applied by the Court in its cases involving the one doctrine of constitutional sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.004" offset="4883971">The only other possibility that would entitle respondent to prevail in this case would be some notion of non constitutional immunity unique to admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.256" offset="4924931">But, of course, whatever else Workman held... and respondent takes the position that Workman did not decide the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.654" offset="4958473">We think it did, for the reasons I've already stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.259" offset="4968922">But whatever else it held, it clearly held that, as a matter of the Federal law of admiralty, political subdivisions are not entitled to immunity from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.906" offset="5003508">So the Court could not adopt a non constitutional rule of immunity limited to the admiralty context without overruling Workman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.481" offset="5037780">Respondent does not ask the Court to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.086" offset="5048229">And indeed, so far as I can tell from reading respondent's brief, it does not even advocate a non constitutional rule of immunity for admiralty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.595" offset="5090234">So there's no non constitutional basis for immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.621" offset="5110401">The only constitutional basis for immunity is when the political entity is an arm of the State.</text>

            <label>Mr. R. Jonathan Hart</label>
            <text syncTime="2468.650" offset="10010554">Well, it's a function that historically in the Constitution was recognized would be a function on behalf of the State with the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.569" offset="10058202">And... and it has traditionally historically been a function of the States to build roads and run bridges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.061" offset="10096131">And in regard to that, you're talking about navigable waters, and the State has an interest in its own navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.197" offset="10124657">They're delegating a function of the government to build a bridge over their navigable waters and the soils thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.428" offset="10157571">So we would take the position there that... that that is a core sovereign function, that the navigable waters are a sovereign interest of the State, and that should have the dignity and respect of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.942" offset="10203651">The design of the Constitution was that there would be dual sovereignty created both in federalism and under State sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.632" offset="10258404">There's not a single case you all are going to have that's going to be able to define all the principles of general sovereign immunity, but we think this is a situation in which the Court, by making a holding in in personam actions, can recognize the State's residual immunity, not so much focus on the Eleventh Amendment and the cases thereunder, but try to come up with a set of principles that you can begin talking about the whole of general sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.429" offset="10365611">And we do not necessarily agree that the... the State... the arm of the State test has to apply in all situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.837" offset="10403227">We think this is an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.348" offset="10409287">It's a narrow exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.442" offset="10413676">Core sovereign functions are going to be narrowly defined, especially when a county is acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.902" offset="10439485">You're going to have to support it with some history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.768" offset="10450979">You're going to have to support it with some State dignity where the State has given a clear indication through their State laws that it's a function that the county ought to do, and... and that needs to be respected from the standpoints that States are given wide latitude in the way that they set up and run their government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.340" offset="10525271">And we respectfully request that you make a finding that we have the right to have sovereign immunity in this particular narrow set of circumstances involving navigable waters as... as it stands.</text>

            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="2620.849" offset="10619312">Mr. Chief Justice, just a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.547" offset="10638120">On the issue that was raised by Justice Alito, the... this doctrine comes from the Wickman case from the old Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.461" offset="10669780">That case relied primarily on a... on a case called Kegan from the Supreme Court of Florida, which was, indeed, a bridge case, but it was not an admiralty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.214" offset="10716801">It was a case in which someone who was crossing a bridge with a heavy truck fell through the bridge because the... the bridge was structurally unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.638" offset="10754417">The old Fifth Circuit sort of took it as a bridge case and took over that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.998" offset="10771867">If that fact... the scenario were to come up in Chatham County and the plaintiffs and the defendants were diverse, there is no question that... that the county would be entitled to plead its State law immunity under Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.627" offset="10838427">I will point out incidentally that even though in this case there is diversity of citizenship and admiralty jurisdiction, this Court held in 1953 in a case called Pope &amp; Talbot v. Hawn that in that circumstance, any defense that is available solely on the diversity side under Erie gets trumped by the uniform application of the maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.553" offset="10922123">So that would not be an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.975" offset="10927766">With respect to the question that was raised by Justice Ginsburg, Hines was an admiralty case in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.279" offset="10957023">Under no stretch of construction could that be viewed as an Eleventh Amendment case since it was not a case in law or equity and it was not in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.354" offset="10993281">And number three, the proprietary governmental distinction has been rejected in the Workman case itself where it was raised in the specific context of admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.700" offset="11042704">I will point out it has never been part of this Court's sovereign immunity doctrine, and with respect, other areas of federalism law tend to indicate that the issue not be adopted now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.651" offset="11102473">You may recall that such a distinction between core and non core governmental functions was at the core of the... of this... this Court's cases under National League of Cities v. Usery, and in the Garcia case, the Court overruled National League of Cities primarily on the point that the distinction between core and non core governmental functions had proven to be unworkable.</text>
