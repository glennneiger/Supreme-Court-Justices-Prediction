            <text syncTime="56.158" offset="313010">For reasons stated in a remarkably interesting, 20-page opinion filed with the Clerk, we conclude that the post-donning walking time is compensable, but the pre-donning waiting time is not.</text>

            <text syncTime="83.276" offset="421470">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
