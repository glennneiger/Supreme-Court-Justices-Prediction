            <text syncTime="9.674" offset="225224">Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="11.752" offset="233479">We ask this Court to preserve the status quo to require that the President respect time honored limitations on military commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.983" offset="266393">These limits, placed in Articles 21 and 36 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, require no more than that the President try offenses that are, indeed, war crimes and to conduct trials according to the minimal procedural requirements of the UCMJ and the laws of war themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.227" offset="343402">These limits do not represent any change in the way military commissions have historically operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.536" offset="368689">Rather, they reflect Congress's authority under the Define and Punish Clause to codify limits on commissions, limits that this Court has historically enforced to avoid presidential blank checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.450" offset="416336">And because this commission transgresses those limits, it should be struck down and the District Court order reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.753" offset="441518">If I could turn to the jurisdictional matter for a few moments first, we believe that the DTA, while certainly not a model of clarity, does not divest this Court of jurisdiction, for four essential reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.443" offset="496271">The first is that, if I could turn to the surreply at page... the appendix at page 14(a), that contains the initial version of the bill that passed the Senate on November 10th.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.873" offset="546008">And at 14(a) it says, on the effective date provision,</text>
            <text syncTime="93.738" offset="561472">"The amendment made by paragraph 1. "</text>
            <text syncTime="96.676" offset="573175">which is the jurisdiction stripping provision,</text>
            <text syncTime="99.548" offset="584669">"shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of enactment of this Act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="107.178" offset="615180">That language clearly attempted to strip courts of jurisdiction over Guantanamo claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.483" offset="640467">That language, however, was changed in the final version of the DTA, and the final version of the DTA is found at page 10(a) of the surreply.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.380" offset="675993">And that has the following as its effective date.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.001" offset="686547">It has two effective date provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.923" offset="694174">The first one I want to start with is H(2), review of combatant status tribunal, CSRT, and military commission decisions,</text>
            <text syncTime="135.587" offset="728865">"Paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection (e) shall apply with respect to any claim whose review is governed by one of such paragraphs and that is pending on or after the date of enactment of the Act. "</text>

            <text syncTime="271.818" offset="1273779">However, that still leaves in place the Government's main argument in the D.C. Circuit below, which is that the E(2) provision governing CSRT and final decisions, and the H(2) provision governing final decisions of... final decisions of CSRTs, truncates all of the review that is currently in the D.C. Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.330" offset="2211784">First, if that's the reading that the Government wants to give, well, then it essentially means that the... that the President has the ability to block habeas corpus or post DTA review for all time, because, Justice Alito, it doesn't turn on... you can't walk into court right after you're convicted, under the DTA; you can only walk into court after a final decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.459" offset="2484398">The whole point of this is to say we're challenging the lawfulness of the tribunal itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.585" offset="2504878">This isn't a challenge to some decision that a court makes.</text>

            <text syncTime="586.989" offset="2534449">And that's why it's different than the ordinary criminal context that you're positing.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.432" offset="2556287">The ordinary criminal context you're positing... and I'm thinking of a case like Schlesinger versus Councilman, a court martial case... what the Court has said is that it's the... the predicate for abstention is the idea that Congress has fairly balanced the rights of both sides, an independent branch, and has... and has made certain determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.498" offset="2632460">Here, none of that has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.303" offset="2639774">It's all been made by the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.247" offset="2647507">And the difference is crucial in military justice, because, as Justice Kennedy said for the Court in Loving, the framers harbored a deep distrust of military tribunals.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.165" offset="2691183">And the thing that makes it different than the ordinary criminal context, the thing that, as this Court said, stops military justice from being lawless is the Congress of the United States setting clear limits on the use of military justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.884" offset="2754086">Now, if those limits had been observed, if this Court... if the military commission complied with the rules of courts martial, we wouldn't be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.619" offset="2792956">Our whole point is that they don't, and that it falls outside of the well recognized abstention exception for courts martial cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.016" offset="2826602">In addition, we believe that to further... to further on... Justice Alito, on your point... this point is already said in the military commission context that a different rule applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.030" offset="2874667">In Quirin, this Court rushed in to hear a military commission challenge before the commission was over, and the reason why it did so was, it said that the public interest required adjudication of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.720" offset="2929420">And the public interest is no less severe in that case than it is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.363" offset="2951990">That is, this is a military commission that is literally unbounded by the laws, Constitution, and treaties of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.068" offset="10002752">The executive branch has long exercised the authority to try enemy combatants by military commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.473" offset="10032427">That authority was part and parcel of George Washington's authority as Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary Forces, as dramatically illustrated by the case of Major Andre.</text>

            <text syncTime="2474.313" offset="10083732">Congress has repeatedly recognized and sanctioned that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.761" offset="10101600">Indeed, each time Congress has extended the jurisdiction of the court martials, Congress was at pains to emphasize that that extension did not come in derogation of the jurisdiction of military commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.025" offset="10150605">And in its most recent action, Congress clearly did not operate as somebody who viewed the military commissions as ultra vires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.172" offset="10183206">They offered no immediate review, and no review at all for charges resulting in a conviction of less than 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.642" offset="10209120">Of course, even more clearly, Congress's most recent action made it clear that the courts no longer have jurisdiction over preenforcement challenges.</text>

            <text syncTime="2699.672" offset="10985165">In court martials, they regulate every jot and tittle of the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.054" offset="10998749">And if the UCMJ and its provisions for court martials applies, then the defendants are going to get not just Miranda, but Miranda plus, and a whole panoply of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.946" offset="11034276">If, on the other hand, this Court follows the precedents in Madsen, it will recognize that only those nine provisions of the UCMJ that expressly reference military commissions will apply, and the rest is left to a much more common law, war court approach, where there's much greater flexibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="3679.639" offset="14905100">And I think that's important, because if Congress wanted to put in a savings clause of the kind that this Court seems to refer to in Bruner, and that would certainly be consistent with Senator Levin's intent, it would have been very easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.719" offset="14953374">Instead of saying 1005&gt; ["], they could have said "except for pending cases".</text>

            <text syncTime="3717.189" offset="15055252">It doesn't say "pending cases", it says "pending claims".</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.305" offset="15067686">Congress understood two important things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.649" offset="15077090">There were no cases currently pending under E(2) and E(3), because Congress was creating E(2) and E(3).</text>

            <text syncTime="4353.306" offset="17599787">This is much more of a call for military commissions in a real war than, certainly, the use of military commissions against the Medoc Indians or any number of other instances in which the President has availed himself of this authority in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.069" offset="17650779">I think the events of 9/11 speak to the fact that this is a war where the laws of war are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.045" offset="17670736">As to whether or not the law of war encompasses the crime of conspiracy to violate the laws of war, we think that is clearly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.509" offset="17700516">That is something that the United States treated as a valid war crime in the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.969" offset="17722354">That is something that the United States treated as a valid war crime in World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.085" offset="17738863">I would invite you, as to the former, to look at Winthrop's Treatise, page 839, note 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.544" offset="17760702">He makes it very clear that those conspiracies are not just conspiracies of municipal law, what he called "of the first class", but they included the second class, which are classic war crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.719" offset="17801348">The most prominent examples are the Lincoln conspirators and a conspiracy at Andersonville Prison to deny POWs their lawful rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.277" offset="17835621">Clearly, those are classic war crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.455" offset="17844294">In World War II, of course, conspiracy was also charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.237" offset="17859445">And this Court saw it in the Kearing case, although it didn't reach that element of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.186" offset="17875223">Now, I think it's very important to understand that history, because the most relevant text on this question is Article 21's reference to the law of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4430.000" offset="17906465">And as this Court was crystal clear in the Madsen case, what that reference is, is Congress's effort, when it extended the jurisdiction of the courts martials to include more and more crimes, that it didn't want to crowd out the military jurisdiction of the military commissions just because they had concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.212" offset="17971353">And this Court, in Madsen, said what Congress authorized was the jurisdiction of the military commissions as it existed in 1916, and then presumably again when it passed Article 21 of the UCMJ, the jurisdiction that existed as of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.563" offset="18032793">Well, in 1960, you could try conspiracies to violate the law of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.461" offset="18048362">In 1950, you could violate conspiracies to the law of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.560" offset="18060796">So, now let me try to get to the procedures that would be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.598" offset="18072917">The argument that's made here is an extraordinary one, that Article 36, when it says that military commissions can deviate from the laws of evidence, to the extent the President determines necessary, except that it must apply to the... comply with the provisions of the UCMJ.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.294" offset="18135716">Clearly, what that provision means is the provisions of the UCMJ that specifically impose requirements on the military commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.847" offset="18165913">And there are nine of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.191" offset="18171242">And they impose some... certain minimum rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.546" offset="18180646">But to say that that provision incorporates all of the UCMJ provisions that put much higher requirements on courts martials, is to violate this Court's Madsen decision, which clearly recognized that there were differences between court martials and military commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.414" offset="18240205">And, although that was an act... that was a case that addressed the articles of war, Article 38 is identical to Article 36(a) of the UCMJ, so that's not a difference that matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.183" offset="18283255">And, if I could say, the other thing is, that just violates any normal principle of statutory construction, because then the nine express references to the military commissions are rendered utterly superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.585" offset="18324842">Clearly, what Congress had in mind was that,</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.612" offset="18332992">"You must comply with those provisions of the UCMJ that apply specifically to the military commissions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.071" offset="18354831">If I could make this point clear, because I think it's helpful in reading the past cases, what made Yamashita and other of the World War II cases so difficult is that the President in that situation constituted commissions that violated even the procedural rules that the articles of war made specifically applicable to the commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.872" offset="18425988">And so, if you look, for example, at Justice Rutledge's dissent in the Yamashita case, he was at pains to emphasize that very few of the provisions of the articles of war applied to military commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.280" offset="18467680">And the difficulty was that the... that the military, in that case, was not complying with even those provisions that specifically applied to military commissions by terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.372" offset="18504042">That's not an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.866" offset="18509998">These military commissions comply with all of the provisions of the UCMJ that are specifically addressed to military commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.686" offset="18537270">So, I just don't think there's a procedural problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.107" offset="18546987">The import of extending Article 2 jurisdiction to new individuals doesn't mean that anything in Yamashita, as to this point, is really no... is still relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.193" offset="18591291">What that does is, it takes away the argument... to the extent that these individuals are within Article 2, it takes away the argument that the President doesn't have to even comply with those provisions of the UCMJ that are expressly directed to the military commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.734" offset="18645417">But that's not an argument we're making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.655" offset="18653149">The argument on the other side of this is really that when Congress specifies that nine rules apply to military commissions, and everything else applies to courts martials, that somehow all of them have to apply to the military commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.001" offset="18702468">And as Justice Scalia's question alluded to earlier, in order to accept that argument, you really have to believe that what Congress was doing when it was carefully preserving the military... the jurisdiction of the military commissions was simply to preserve the option of calling something that had to comply with every single statutory requirement in the court martials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.651" offset="18777074">They got to label it something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.245" offset="18783448">They got to label it a "military commission".</text>

            <text syncTime="4866.724" offset="19653430">And I would say, at a minimum, if there is some role for customary international law here, it has to, consistently with The Paquete Habana case, take into account and give due weight to a controlling executive act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5107.741" offset="20617453">He can make the argument that he wants to make in front of the commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.356" offset="20631977">If the commission rejects the argument, then there will be review of that decision in the Court of Appeals on a concrete record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.577" offset="20660816">This Court can then address that under 1254.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.782" offset="20673668">The use of military commissions to try enemy combatants has been part and parcel of the war power for 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.579" offset="20704806">Congress recognized it in 1916 in the Articles of War, then again, after World War II, in the UCMJ.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.399" offset="20732078">This Court recognized it in a host of cases, not just Quirin, but Yamashita, Eisentrager, and, most clearly, in Madsen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.613" offset="20760917">Since that is such an important component of the law of war, something that has been part and parcel of that power from Major Andre's capture to today, there is no reason for this Court to depart from that tradition.</text>

            <text syncTime="5159.148" offset="20823089">It is a foundational role of this Court, as Justice Kennedy says, to test the lawfulness of tribunals, particularly executive detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.077" offset="20870841">And in the pretrial area, that's the historic role of this Court from Bereford to Quirin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.631" offset="20897067">This claim is... Mr. Hamdan's claim is primarily a jurisdictional one, as both courts below found when they recognized his ability to bring this pretrial challenge, because he is not an offender under the laws of war until he obtains his Article 5 hearing, because the charge doesn't state a violation of the laws of war, which is, itself, jurisdictional, and because it doesn't follow the procedures of the laws of war, which this Court, in Yamashita, in pages 5, and, in the dissent, at page 72, recognized as jurisdictional.</text>

            <text syncTime="5216.709" offset="21053384">--With respect to conspiracy?</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.136" offset="21059027">Yes, I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.047" offset="21062684">And I do believe the text says that they're referring to domestic offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.595" offset="21080865">It's certainly the case that conspiracy has been tried as a violation of the laws of war at some point in the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.559" offset="21112734">But that has been entirely eclipsed by the modern laws of war, which have rejected it everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.146" offset="21139066">And if you adopt the Government's reading, Justice Stevens, that the laws of war are frozen into time in 1916, then I believe there goes the Government's case entirely, because the thrust of the Government's case is the laws of war have to adapt to this stateless, territoryless organization known as al Qaeda.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.596" offset="21216911">If we're playing by 1916 rules, there is no way that this commission would have been accepted in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.838" offset="21249825">Now, all of those jurisdictional pretrial challenges were accepted by the courts below when the full panoply of DTA rights... when the full panoply of rights existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.100" offset="21298935">Now the DTA certainly circumscribes the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.483" offset="21316490">We don't know whether question 1 very clearly is able to be raised after the DTA's enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.443" offset="21340313">We certainly... question 2, as the Solicitor General has said, is not raisable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.969" offset="21358390">We don't know when it can be raised, because the President can block final review for all time under the DTA.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.355" offset="21387961">He has the keys to the Federal courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.893" offset="21398096">And if you defer to this system and give the President the ability to launch all of these tribunals for 75 individuals with these charges, with these procedures, you will be countenancing a huge expansion of military jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.522" offset="21464552">Conspiracy is one of the few offenses, Justices, that has now been rejected by the laws of war internationally in tribunal after tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.847" offset="21501854">It's certainly never been approved by a Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.102" offset="21510945">And, indeed, it has been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.779" offset="21517632">In Colepaugh, for example, no challenge to conspiracy was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.405" offset="21536127">The Government's argument, in the end, it seems to me, is one that this Court rejected in Levin, because it depends, as its predicate, on the idea that the President has ultimate flexibility with respect to these military commissions, except for the nine provisions in the UCMJ which govern translators and deposition testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5359.510" offset="21624525">It is inconceivable that the UCMJ, when enacted, intended to regulate military commissions with only that bare bones to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.485" offset="21660470">Indeed, General Crowder said,</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.673" offset="21669247">"Military commissions and courts martial follow the same procedures. "</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.205" offset="21687324">Finally, Justices, we'd just point out that the predicate of abstention is not met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.770" offset="21717626">This is not a ordinary criminal trial applying lawful ordinary procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.412" offset="21740196">This is an ad hoc trial in which the procedures are all defined with the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.188" offset="21763288">He says the laws of war do not apply when we're talking about protecting this vulnerable individual at Guantanamo.</text>
            <text syncTime="5401.175" offset="21791187">But then he says they do apply and permit him to charge Mr. Hamdan with the one offense which is rejected entirely at international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.567" offset="21828803">It was a great American patriot, Thomas Paine, who warned,</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.683" offset="21841237">"He who... that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression, for if he violates that duty, he establishes a precedent that will reach unto himself. "</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.174" offset="21879167">That's what we're asking you to do here, just enforce the lawful uses of military commissions and the historic role of this Court.</text>
