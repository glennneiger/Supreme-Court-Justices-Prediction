            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="7.352" offset="117937">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.955" offset="140297">The respondent, John McDonald, a black man, is the sole shareholder and president of JWM Investments, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.804" offset="179690">The petitioners here -- collectively, I will refer to them as “Domino’s Pizza” -- contracted with McDonald's corporation, JWM, to construct four restaurants in the Las Vegas area.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.304" offset="241757">Problems developed between JWM and Domino’s after the first restaurant was completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.875" offset="267984">To make a long story short, the contracts between JWM and Domino’s remained uncompleted, and at least in part for that reason JWM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.596" offset="318871">In the bankruptcy proceedings, the breach-of-contract claim against Domino’s was settled by the trustee in bankruptcy for $45,000, and JWM gave Domino’s a complete release.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.988" offset="376444">In his personal capacity and separate from JWM’s bankruptcy proceedings, McDonald's brought the present claim under 42 U.S.C. §1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.443" offset="426286">This provision originally, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, protects the equal right of, “all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States to make and enforce contracts,” without regard to race.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.958" offset="492324">The statute defines the term “make and enforce contracts” to, “include the making, performance, modification and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms and conditions of the contractual relationship”.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.579" offset="566825">McDonald alleged that Domino’s broke its contract with JWM because of racial animas towards McDonald and that this breach harmed McDonald personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.301" offset="613741">The District Court granted Domino’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, since McDonald himself was party to no contract with Domino’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.650" offset="655119">The Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.881" offset="668075">Relying on its own precedent, it concluded that McDonald's injury was, “distinct from that of the corporation,” and that he therefore could bring his own 1981 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.057" offset="712797">The 9th Circuit acknowledged that its approach set it apart from other circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.379" offset="734008">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk, we reverse the judgment of the 9th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.015" offset="752608">The contractual relationship that was allegedly impaired for racially discriminatory reasons was between Domino’s and JWM.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.380" offset="790015">McDonald points out that in his capacity as president of JWM, he did, “make and enforce” contracts for JWM.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.524" offset="838603">But the rights under those contracts belonged to JWM itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.237" offset="861486">McDonald chose to conduct business through the corporate form and acted as agent of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.528" offset="882593">This carries with it certain advantages; for example, McDonald was not personally liable in JWM’s bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.208" offset="913313">But the bitter must be taken with the sweet.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.877" offset="924075">Here, the corporate form prevents McDonald from claiming JWM’s injuries or rights as his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.308" offset="949780">McDonald's role as an agent of JWM does not give him the ability to state a claim under 1981, because that statute does not protect one’s right to act as the agent of someone else’s contracting; it instead protects the right to give and receive contractual rights of one’s own.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.850" offset="1027938">McDonald alleges that his race was the reason Domino’s breached its contracts with JWM and that he was the actual target of Domino’s actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.392" offset="1070048">But the reason for the impairment does not change the fact that McDonald had no rights under the contractual relationship that was impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.655" offset="1103171">Section 1981 is a powerful remedy for racial discrimination in contracting, but it has always been limited to remedying race-based impairments to one’s own existing or proposed contractual relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.712" offset="1163357">The 9th Circuit therefore erred in reversing the District Court’s dismissal, and its judgment is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.538" offset="1186658">The opinion is unanimous; Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision in the case.</text>
