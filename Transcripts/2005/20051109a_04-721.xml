            <text syncTime="8.262" offset="189686">The Ninth Circuit decision in the court below was wrong, for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.047" offset="208807">It adopted a rule that frustrates Congress's intent to protect Federal Courts from hearing stale claims and to respect the finality of State Court convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.341" offset="253947">It does so by improperly and arbitrarily adopting a conclusive presumption that misunderstands or ignores State law and practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.627" offset="287175">And it is inconsistent with this Court's decision in Carey versus Saffold.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.787" offset="303789">If the Federal Courts, on the other hand, complete their analysis of the Federal question of tolling the AEDPA statute of limitations by deciding whether a State petition was timely before granting tolling, it can properly dismiss more Federal petitions on statute of limitations grounds and can avoid litigating stale claims on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.549" offset="386858">Any difficulties in doing so can be ameliorated by the limited nature of the State law inquiry and adoption of a 60-day presumption of timeliness.</text>

            <text syncTime="78.958" offset="474943">Well, Justice Ginsburg, when California does look to timeliness in proceeding from one lower court to a higher court, then we see that it contemplates that a... that a litigant will proceed in 60 days or less, because... and the reason we have to turn to analogies is because nothing in California law requires the appellate courts in State habeas to look to that particular period of time between the lower court decision and proceeding to that court, because they're courts of original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.327" offset="633872">So, they look at how long the prisoner proceeded from conviction to their court, as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.079" offset="660935">But the reason that we need to figure out this period is because this Court, in Carey versus Saffold, has said that our system functions enough like an appellate system to bring those periods into the tolling provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.225" offset="6537545">In light of Justice Breyer's questions, I feel compelled to begin with a brief explanation of why this case is a necessary consequence of Saffold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.558" offset="6578819">And, although it wasn't my initial intention to speak plainly, what I would suggest is that the problem is not the Ninth Circuit's decision in this case, but, rather, California's timeliness standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.975" offset="6632527">And the problem that's presented by this case is one of Federal line drawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.114" offset="6657082">And it presents serious federalism, comity, and fairness concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.247" offset="6677562">And if we could step back from the facts of this case for a moment... and I will discuss them... I think it... I hope, at least, it will become clear that the Ninth Circuit, in light of what it's dealing with in California, adopted the only sensible rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.376" offset="6742136">So, the place to begin in answering some of your questions, Justice Breyer, is with California's timeliness standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.981" offset="6776514">And to give some background, I would start with the principle that was articulated in the Warden's brief and that the California Supreme Court has articulated, which is that California does enforce its timeliness standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.271" offset="7053725">It's essentially an ad hoc determination that's made by individual California Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.758" offset="7075668">And that's why former Justice Brown described that as "an abstraction", and former Justice Moss described it as</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.211" offset="7217460">And, to give you some statistics from the Warden's brief, in 2004 there were 1,223 unexplained summary denials... in other words, just denied... and there were 1,174 denials with a citation to a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.308" offset="7293843">And this is significant, because this means that, in about half of the cases in 2004 that went to the California Supreme Court, they enforced one of their procedural bars, and, in many of them, it was timeliness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1849.587" offset="7554963">First, which was bothering me, had to do with our Court's relation to the Ninth Circuit, which may be simple and... as far as legally is concerned... but I'm not sure about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1867.911" offset="7628210">It says the words "on the merits".</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.460" offset="7638450">The Ninth Circuit thought those three words meant that the California Supreme Court could not have considered the petition too late, for, after all, it decided it on the merits, just as with the cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.930" offset="7692367">Now, whether these words are right or wrong that follow, that's what we wrote.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.235" offset="7725594">Sometimes, a court addresses the merits of a claim that it thought was presented in an untimely way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1900.079" offset="7756941">Because they don't present any difficulty, and the timeliness issue does, or because it wants to give the reviewing court alternative grounds for decision, or maybe it just wants to show the prisoner we thought about the claim on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.947" offset="7808455">He, after all, doesn't have a lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1916.397" offset="7822247">So, there are a lot of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.971" offset="7828517">And it says, "Conclusion".</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.357" offset="7838025">Given the variety of reasons why they might have put the words "on the merits", the fact that they are there, those words cannot, by themselves, show that the petition was timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.331" offset="7881911">So, then I read what they wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.826" offset="7887971">What they wrote is,</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.751" offset="7895599">"When the California Court denies a habeas petition without comment or citation, we have long treated the denial as a decision on the merits. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1970.520" offset="8038646">So, what do we do about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.565" offset="8046900">Then the next question, once I figure that one out, is, What do we do about the issue you're raising, which is quite important and interesting and so forth?</text>

            <text syncTime="1981.339" offset="8082009">Well, as to the first question, the explanation that you just provided clearly requires the Federal Courts, when there's some indication from the State Court that it might have been untimely, to look into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.430" offset="8138329">And that was the very problem with what the Ninth Circuit did in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.734" offset="8155570">It said</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.145" offset="8157242">"on the merits and for lack of diligence. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.903" offset="8168213">So, to presume that that was just on the merits, that's flatly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.452" offset="8182424">You'd need to do some further investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.598" offset="8190992">In light of the context of what's happening in California, however, when the State Court says nothing, there has to be some process by which the Federal Court can make a decision as to what that means, because if, in fact, in that case it was denied no the merits and the State Court thought it was timely, it would be extremely invasive for the Federal Court to rereview the case, potentially come to a different conclusion, and, we would suggest, dramatically alter the landscape of how prisoners exhaust their remedies in California, because now you're developing a Federal body of law that may be very different in deciding what's substantial and what's reasonable than California did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.092" offset="8368938">And so, what the Ninth Circuit, I believe, did in this case was look to context and come up with the presumption that was most reasonable in light of what's going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.820" offset="8583874">And where I would start is with the California Supreme Court's decision in In re Sanders.</text>
