            <text syncTime="9.025" offset="183170">The complaint in this case actually alleges that Domino's breached its obligations under a contract with JWM.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.415" offset="220682">It does not allege that any of the terms of McDonald's own contracts were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.094" offset="247431">The Ninth Circuit, nevertheless, held that Mr. McDonald could recover damages so long as he could show that he had suffered some distinct injury arising out of the violation of the contracts between his company and Domino's.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.652" offset="309707">We... we ask this Court to reverse that holding for two principal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.505" offset="329038">First, Mr. McDonald did not hold any rights under the contracts between his company JWM and Domino's, and that's disqualifying under section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.486" offset="380969">Second, the injuries that he alleges are simply too indirect to be cognizable under an implied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.300" offset="416287">This Court, even in the context of express rights of action, whether RICO or the Clayton Act, has looked to the background principles of the common law to define the scope of a damage recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.131" offset="471562">And these kinds of injuries, which are really the classic form of derivative injury, have never been recoverable.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.740" offset="1194004">I mean, first of all, these were contracts where Domino's had rights under these contracts as well, and if it had sued Mr. McDonald under the terms of the contract for failing to perform, he would have rightly said, that's not my contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.086" offset="2227408">Then I have retained the legal control under the terms of my contract as to whether the plaintiff's contract can be performed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.322" offset="2260323">And in that circumstance, if... if I deny approval on the basis of race, I have made it literally impossible for the other parties to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.945" offset="2290834">And that's the... the narrow exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.571" offset="2297312">It's either inducing the breach, inducing the breach of a contract, or it's making it literally impossible, but not simply making it more expensive or more difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.971" offset="2339003">And... and I think it's important to emphasize why these rules were developed under the common law this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.960" offset="2362932">In... in part, it is to protect the very reasonable and legitimate interests of... of innocent third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.825" offset="2394383">In... in... take the corporate context.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.629" offset="2401593">If General Motors has a dispute with a major customer, and imagine that there is some sense that that... that the customer may have breached its contracts because it... it thought GM's work force had too many black faces, GM has got to figure out what to do about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.414" offset="2476721">It's not going to capitulate and fire its work force, but it has to decide whether it wants to settle, whether it wants to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.178" offset="2507754">It may litigate and then want to settle.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.373" offset="2516532">But that's its claim, its contract claim, and it has to have the freedom to figure out how it ought to be settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.041" offset="2551222">If every black employee at GM could file an action under section 1981 for emotional distress or for wage increases that they might not have gotten because GM lost this big piece of business, then GM would lose the ability to control the settlement of its own claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.054" offset="2623320">And so... and it's an innocent party in this fact pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.746" offset="2638053">So the law has been designed under... under the common law to make sure that everybody's interests are sufficiently protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.028" offset="2667206">And what the Ninth Circuit's, you know, ruling does here and what the plaintiffs are really asking for is to just blow through all of those rules that... that have been designed to... to make sense out of contracts... contract laws and still allow some room for tortious interference sorts of principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.177" offset="2743797">And under... under the Court's cases, I don't think there is any basis to think that Congress intended the Court to create an implied right of action that is completely divorced from the common law principles that would have foreclosed these kinds of remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.852" offset="5234520">And, nevertheless, we are aware of no case that has ever found that an employee of a company or a shareholder of a company could recover under common law tortious interference theory simply because it suffered losses arising out of a breach of contract with its own corporation that made it more difficult or more expensive for the corporation to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.927" offset="5322814">And I think it... it is... also bears emphasis of where this theory would take the Court if it were to recognize this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.180" offset="5351758">It would go far afield from the core requirement that there not be discrimination in the terms of an employment contract because this... the tortious interference theory, of course, is based solely on the concept that he may have had some sort of implied employment agreement with JWM.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.622" offset="5421557">What this would mean then is that if... in the case of GM, if a major customer cancels a contract and GM doesn't give raises to its work force, all of the black workers would have causes of action because of the injuries that were intended because the contract was canceled on the basis of race, but their similarly situated white coworkers would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.090" offset="5527405">They would have suffered exactly the same injury, but they would have completely different rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.567" offset="5549348">And that shows why this derivative injury theory just doesn't fit section 1981 because at its core, it has to be about preventing discrimination in the terms of the actual contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.921" offset="5606713">And here, there is no allegation that JWM subjected McDonald to any discriminatory terms of employment, and therefore, it is not... or that it... a breach was induced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.770" offset="5658122">And therefore, it isn't the paradigm case, and it would create problems down the road to recognize this... this kind of theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.935" offset="5690827">So I don't... I don't think that we are asking the Court to do anything radical, and I think the whole issue of tortious interference can be avoided, if the Court would prefer, because the... the theory was unquestionably waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.538" offset="5737221">There are 14 paragraphs of facts in this complaint laying out the factual allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.198" offset="5763865">Paragraph 11 says that Mr. McDonald is the president, sole shareholder, and operator of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.322" offset="5796362">Nowhere in those 14 paragraphs does it say that he had an employment contract with JWM.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.072" offset="5823320">Similarly, the cause of action paragraphs... I believe there are 15 of them... repeatedly identify the contracts between Domino's and JWM as the contract at issue, the contract that was breached, the terms that were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.367" offset="5880581">Nowhere does it refer to an employment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.555" offset="5893328">This complaint, as the district court recognized, only pled one theory, and that was the theory that Mr. McDonald was entitled to enforce the rights of JWM.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.603" offset="5929482">It does not plead any theory about violations of his own employment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.143" offset="5955604">And as I said, that... even if... even if you could infer it, you would still have to find that it's not a cognizable theory because he doesn't allege that the terms of that contract were actually violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.869" offset="6002520">And in fact, at page 45 of his brief... or 44, he concedes that JWM did perform the terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.865" offset="6038569">And second, even if there had been a failure of performance, he cannot show that Domino's was a sufficiently direct cause of that failure of performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.806" offset="6082246">Just... just to give, you know, yet another example, I mean, if I... if my employer has a... a bad year this year because somebody breached a contract with the employer and I don't get a bonus, I... you know, I may say I suffered some... some loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.542" offset="6153194">The value of my contract, my employment contract, may be reduced, but my rights under that contract have not been impaired or abrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.467" offset="6188930">I have the same rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.012" offset="6195095">They're just worth something less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.119" offset="6203559">And all that this statute does is to protect rights, the same rights as white people have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.500" offset="6233025">It doesn't say that you are protected from any kind of discriminatory conduct in the economy that may, in some sense, make your rights less valuable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.242" offset="6300003">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.081" offset="6339395">The issue here is whether, by choosing to operate as a solely owned corporation, John McDonald forfeited his 1981 protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.680" offset="6377743">Rather than federalizing State contract law, section 1981 imposes a nonnegotiable nondiscrimination duty that is neither a contractual provision nor governed by contract law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.170" offset="6431764">Intentional racial discrimination is not merely a breach of contract terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.604" offset="6449528">As this Court has already noticed... noted, it is more akin to a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.747" offset="6470008">Domino's question presented asks that both plaintiff and defendant had to be parties to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.011" offset="6499160">Yet, Domino's notes that non parties without privy of contract are also protected, citing third party beneficiaries and the fact there were employers, such as supervisory employees or prime contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.051" offset="6551301">Thus, even Domino's concedes that the answer to the question presented is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.694" offset="6569795">Section 1981 protection is not limited to parties to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.026" offset="6587141">There's still, however, the remaining question of whether John McDonald fits within the statute's protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.146" offset="6611696">Clearly, if he had been a sole proprietor, there would be no question of stating a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.733" offset="6633952">We contend that he's still protected based on three grounds: one, the intended language of section 1981; two, John McDonald's relationship with Domino's; and three, John McDonald's relationship with JWM.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.602" offset="13489528">And clearly, it would make no sense to have... have different ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.397" offset="13508649">So they were 1982 claims, but the idea that discrimination in terms of housing should have dignitary claims, as well, discrimination in terms of contract should not is something this Court has never accepted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.481" offset="13580956">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.291" offset="13592241">I'd like to focus on the issue of whether there is any need for a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.138" offset="13615647">The district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and I think that it's fair to say that at that point, the plaintiff was under an obligation to seek leave to amend if it had any other alternative theory that it wanted to advance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.466" offset="13680953">Otherwise, we're left with the situation where they can see that dismissal with prejudice, litigate up to the Ninth Circuit, and then we litigate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.051" offset="13715225">We go back down and we keep doing this seriatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.269" offset="13724107">It would make no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.493" offset="13729018">The dismissal with prejudice was proper, and certainly in a 1981 case, despite liberal rules of pleading, you have to identify the contract that was supposedly violated, as well as, you know, the other elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.382" offset="13780636">Second, I think that if this were a harder case about tortious interference principles, even if it hadn't been waived, I might understand the Court's reluctance to get into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.482" offset="13820969">But we know from the briefing that the plaintiff has conceded that his claim would not be cognizable under the common law of contract, third party beneficiary, or tortious interference, and that is very plain from the brief at pages, I think, 43 through 46 where they acknowledge that under section 76 of the Restatement, they would not be able to... to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.863" offset="13914488">And they say, so what.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.105" offset="13919503">This isn't a federalized version of common law of interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.326" offset="13932355">So given that concession, I think all this Court would have to say is that the alternative theory that wasn't even pled can't possibly state a claim because it... it asks us to go far beyond what the common law did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3463.166" offset="13999751">But supposing a fact situation in which a wholly owned... a... a corporation wholly owned by an African American starts to negotiate with your client, and your client says, we have a policy of not dealing with companies owned by African Americans.</text>

            <text syncTime="3547.651" offset="14337671">That's what the courts of appeals all do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.635" offset="14345612">Judge Friendly in Hudson Valley Freedom Theater looked at this issue and said that it was the best way to approach this issue, that... that... and explained that it doesn't make sense to impute the corporation's contract rights to somebody else, give them power to enforce their contract rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.474" offset="14424920">And it wasn't a 1981 case, but it was analogous, and that it made sense to, under those circumstances, impute race, in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.958" offset="14454909">And I think that the way that courts have done it is also linked to the word discrimination, which appears in 1981(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.849" offset="14482494">In... in Jackson v. Birmingham for the... for instance, this Court did find that a... a male coach had been subjected to discrimination on the basis of sex, even though he's obviously not a woman, because it's a form of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.852" offset="14538501">And I think the courts have looked at that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.448" offset="14548845">But this... the... the... all of the exact same issues that are alleged in this complaint were already raised and litigated through depositions and discovery in the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.140" offset="14587611">And this presents all of the problems that this court addressed in Associated General Contractors about why there's such a strong presumption against derivative claims because here you can't trace the losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.065" offset="14635363">You have no idea whether or not the monies that JWM would have recovered from Domino's would have been used to pay other creditors or used to do new projects or perhaps given to... to McDonald.</text>
