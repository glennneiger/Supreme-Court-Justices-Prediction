            <label>Mr. John H. Blume</label>
            <text syncTime="5.626" offset="175495">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="9.366" offset="190437">In this case, the South Carolina Supreme Court took the second of two recent steps that dramatically curtail a defendant's ability to create a reasonable doubt as to his innocence by presenting evidence that another individual committed the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.800" offset="248220">The first step came in 2001 when, in State v. Gay, the court held that the admissibility of third party guilt evidence was dependent on the strength of the prosecution's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.156" offset="293569">The second step, which occurred in Mr. Holmes' case, holds that third party guilt evidence is inadmissible whenever the prosecution has presented strong forensic evidence of the defendant's guilt.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="45.324" stopTime="96.749">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="45.324" offset="334320">Now, there's some dispute as to whether that... that is really what... what it held.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.747" offset="351979">And there's a big difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.765" offset="360024">If... if you just say whenever you... whenever the prosecution has a strong case, you can't introduce other guilt, or whether all that the court is saying is that one of the elements that you consider in determining whether to admit this... this third party is not just... it's the comparative weakness of the third party case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.427" offset="454692">You don't blind yourself to... to the strength of the prosecution's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.959" offset="472769">Will you say it was bad even if it was the latter that the court was... was referring to?</text>
            <text syncTime="85.166" offset="493667">Are you saying you cannot consider the strength of the prosecution's case at all in determining whether to allow in third party guilt evidence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_h_blume" startTime="96.749" stopTime="143.129">
            <label>Mr. John H. Blume</label>
            <text syncTime="96.749" offset="539956">Yes, Justice Scalia, I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.355" offset="546434">It's not necessary for a ruling in our favor in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.995" offset="560958">It's not contingent here because at a minimum, the South Carolina Supreme Court rule here in describing it, they said in State v. Gay we held that in cases where there is strong evidence of guilt, including strong forensic evidence, evidence that a third party committed the crime is not admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.630" offset="631489">That is a categorical rule of exclusion no matter how you cut it.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.283" offset="650088">But even if you deemed that there is some discretion left in the system, it is still unconstitutional because what the South Carolina system requires is a reasoning backwards, that the admissibility of evidence of the defendant's innocence is conditioned on the judge's assessment of the likelihood of the defendant's guilt.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="143.129" stopTime="195.287">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="143.129" offset="725530">Well, I... I suppose that in a purely discretionary system... I... I can't quite think of the hypothetical... the strength of the prosecution's case may bear on the assessment of relevance and materiality as to the evidence the defense wants to introduce.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.069" offset="793239">If... if the evidence of identification is... is quite clear... is quite clear... and then there's some witness of marginal credibility that says he was in another city, I think that may affect the trial court's balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.259" offset="870039">I... I take the thrust of your point, that the strength of the case makes it more important to introduce the third party evidence, not... not less.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.713" offset="903789">I... I take that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.296" offset="906192">But just as... as an absolute rule, I'm not sure that the strength of the case is always irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.403" offset="930539">That's what I'm saying.</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Blume</label>
            <text syncTime="195.287" offset="934091">I think that it is possible that under some circumstances not the strength of the State's case but the evidence as a whole may shed some light on whether the third party guilt evidence is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.252" offset="981948">For example, if the uncontested evidence is the crime occurred on Tuesday, January 3rd, and the third party guilt evidence shows that the third party was in Acapulco on January 3rd and had no possibility to be there, that's not a strength issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.788" offset="1044119">That is relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.442" offset="1046731">But when the touchstone for admissibility is whether the defense evidence overcomes the prosecution's case... and in the South Carolina rule for... just to be clear, it's not even considered that you consider the evidence of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.903" offset="1104619">The defense evidence of third party guilt has to overcome the prosecution's forensic evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.697" offset="1135757">Everything is identical except what the court of appeals or the State supreme court holds is that we think under rule 403, which happens to be the rule in our State, the probative value doesn't warrant admissibility in light of the risk of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.526" offset="1199077">But everything else is the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="2755.060" offset="11173255">The first is that this case does not approach the outer limit of due process set by this Court in Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.651" offset="11199587">As the trial court found in three specific instances, there is no evidence to corroborate these confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.711" offset="11227799">And the confession evidence itself in Chambers was far stronger than the confession evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.431" offset="11254653">Second, I'd like to respond to Justice Breyer's question about the nature of the Supreme Court of Carolina's opinion and to remind the Court that it's reviewing the judgment primarily, not the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.686" offset="11299688">And it seems to me that petitioner's argument is essentially criticizing the opinion for the absence of a word, the absence of the word automatically, and that the opinion would look very different if it said where there's strong evidence of guilt, the defendant's third party guilt evidence doesn't automatically raise a reasonable inference of innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.390" offset="13430548">The confession itself, in contrast to the evidence here, was a sworn statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.711" offset="13739838">On 135, he also found there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could believe that Jimmy White confessed to being the perpetrator, and there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that Jimmy White had in the past committed acts against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.262" offset="13794068">And then he made the mistake of fact and a mistake of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.820" offset="13832207">Under South Carolina law, he should have been able to have been called.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.798" offset="13840148">He could have been impeached, and the prior... these statements would come in as substantive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.033" offset="13861151">It was also wrong, even as the statement gets penal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.731" offset="13871913">The only corroboration is was the statement made, not is it true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.701" offset="13887796">That's the... and in that case, he found the statements were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.450" offset="13898767">And that's why the State supreme court did not embrace or rely upon what the trial court did because it was clearly wrong.</text>
