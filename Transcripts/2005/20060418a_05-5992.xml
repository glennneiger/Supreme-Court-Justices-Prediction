            <text syncTime="5.783" offset="179768">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="9.126" offset="193143">The Speedy Trial Act protects the public, as well as the personal interests of defendants, by mandating the prompt disposition of Federal criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.052" offset="240790">In this case, the Government and the district court failed to comply with the clear requirements of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.912" offset="272242">As relevant here, the act provides that the trial of a defendant who pleads not guilty and who is released on bail shall commence within 70 days after the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.525" offset="326681">The act, however, is not as inflexible as it sounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.916" offset="344340">The act permits numerous categories of delay to be excluded from the 70-day limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.371" offset="366074">The act also provides an enforcement mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.950" offset="384464">If more than 70 nonexcludable days elapse between the indictment and the trial, the indictment shall be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.468" offset="426469">This case concerns two periods of delay, that each exceed the 70-day time limit, and I'd like to focus initially on the longer period of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.579" offset="474952">This is the delay that took place between 2000 and 2001, after a competency proceeding was taken under advisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.770" offset="519674">Just to put this delay in context, a competency hearing was held on July 10, 2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.740" offset="547572">The judge solicited post hearing briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.959" offset="560425">The matter was taken under advisement on August 23rd, and in our papers, we asked the judge to find petitioner competent and to set the matter for trial as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.540" offset="606818">We noted that at that point the case was already more than 4 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.791" offset="623745">We offered to waive a jury and proceed to a bench trial immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.043" offset="640777">And at that point, the case sat idle for the next 195 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.996" offset="664601">Now, the act excludes only the first 30 days of that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.903" offset="684245">That's section 3161(h)(1)(J).</text>
            <text syncTime="136.248" offset="701590">For reasons that have never been explained, the court sat on the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.734" offset="719563">When 7 months went by, we filed a motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.672" offset="735340">What about, Mr. Zas, that the court thought it was home free on the Speedy Trial Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="148.564" offset="750909">After all, it had gotten a waiver for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.955" offset="764493">Isn't that why the 165 days?</text>

            <text syncTime="155.284" offset="777763">That may be, Justice Ginsburg, but... but as of our filing after the competency proceeding, we asked for a trial as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.473" offset="822485">So putting aside whether the waiver had any validity at all, which I'll get to shortly, the waiver had no effect when we came in and asked for a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.491" offset="866580">Otherwise, defendants would have no right to a speedy trial and--</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="182.071" offset="884865">Yes, but on... on that one, the... the Second Circuit said that he was incompetent, and you could have excluded the time on (4) because (4) allows you to exclude time when he's incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.104" offset="937006">And if, in fact, the district judge is sitting there thinking he's incompetent, then the failure is simply a failure to write down his reason why it's excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.388" offset="974204">I guess there's uncertainty here as to what the reason was the district judge excluded that time, and it's a little bit hypothetical for the reason that Justice Ginsburg mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.751" offset="1023628">But if you were to lose on the first point, then I guess on this point, the thing to do would be to send it back and determine whether, in fact, the judge intended to exclude on the ground of competency, in which case his failure was simply a failure to note down his reason, which is not required by the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.160" offset="1109309">The court only made a finding that Mr. Zedner was incompetent on March 21, 2001.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.882" offset="1136163">Prior to that time, the competency issue was under advisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.101" offset="1152986">It couldn't be that Mr. Zedner's incompetency, if it existed before the finding, is what prevented the court from declaring him incompetent.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.437" offset="1282345">My act must read differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.718" offset="1291540">My act says in (4), any period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.409" offset="1394253">Yes, that's why, see, I guess on this point, we'd have to send it back because if, in fact, the judge had determined in his mind within the 30-day period that the person was incompetent or he was incompetent in fact, then that could have been his reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.820" offset="1455902">I'm not sure what to do about this point in any case, and I understand that you think he wasn't incompetent, or at least it hadn't been so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.134" offset="1497176">The Second Circuit seemed to think he was incompetent because that was their basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.495" offset="6378625">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.714" offset="6403494">On the first of the time periods, it might help if I could start by laying out three basic principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.075" offset="6420944">The first is that a defendant may not opt out of the act by waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.763" offset="6435677">The second is that a... a defendant is, nonetheless, precluded from challenging the grant of a continuance that he requested if the continuance satisfies the substantive ends of justice standards of the act and the defendant's waiver or other litigation conduct induced the court to commit the procedural error of not recording an ends of justice finding in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.330" offset="6509969">And the third related point, although it's not presented here, is that the courts of appeals have recognized that if a defendant requests an ends of justice continuance and the court in a procedurally regular manner grants the ends of justice continuance, the defendant cannot later be heard to contend that there was... the ends of justice were not really satisfied even though he had told the court that they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.646" offset="6587187">We think the reasons for those three rules stems from the reason that defendants cannot opt out of the act in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.882" offset="6616131">Although the act does not contain an express anti waiver or anti estoppel provision, it does manifest an intent to bind defendants to its requirements in order to protect the public interest in a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.931" offset="6656359">If a defendant could opt out of the act altogether and thereby obtain delays that are not authorized by the act, that would thwart the public interest in a speedy trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.652" offset="6695229">But... but as we've indicated, the... the judge was the one that opted out of the act by this regular practice of requiring the perpetual waiver, or whatever we call it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daryl_joseffer" startTime="1643.606" stopTime="1693.524">
            <label>Mr. Daryl Joseffer</label>
            <text syncTime="1643.606" offset="6731069">I guess there... there are couple things there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.154" offset="6741205">One is that we are not... we... we are not here relying on the waiver for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.844" offset="6760013">Our point, instead, here is that when defendant requested the continuance at issue here, it was the defendant that said, Your Honor, I... I need a continuance and I waive my rights so you should give me the continuance and then also said he needed additional preparation time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.440" offset="6810377">The court then... and this... this is at J.A. from about page 81 to 85.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.940" offset="6832425">The court then said, well, why do you need the time?</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.644" offset="6843187">And the court discussed with him for a while why he really needed additional preparation time, reminded counsel that, notwithstanding the waiver, this was a criminal case and criminal cases do need to be tried, and ended up balancing the defendant's desire for preparation against the need for a speedy trial by granting a much shorter continuance than requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.399" offset="6910269">And that is actually an entirely appropriate ends of justice balancing, ends of justice reasoning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.518" offset="7110681">But where the error is a purely procedural one, a failing to record findings in the record regarding a continuance that is permitted under the substantive standards of the act, then holding the defendant to the waiver, under a theory of either waiver or estoppel... in our view it doesn't matter which--</text>

            <text syncTime="1754.944" offset="7176405">I mean, the reason that was given is I have to... I need this time to find out if these really peculiar looking bonds are genuine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.185" offset="7289358">But in addition, it's important to remember that at the end of this 90-day period that was granted, defense counsel withdrew on the ground that his client was still insisting that he present the frivolous defense that... that the bonds were genuine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.172" offset="7333349">And before withdrawing and telling the court that, the... the defense counsel had a very serious to his client and the court to continue to investigate what his client was saying was the defense and to continue to try to work with his client and try to come up with a plausible defense strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.940" offset="7388415">Now, it didn't work and counsel had to withdraw, but I don't think he can be faulted for trying.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.496" offset="7558629">And so everyone in the bar, I mean, has been acting under some... some confusion, we think, that... that frankly, to some extent, persists to this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.294" offset="7585796">We think that the best way to clarify matters going forward is... is a combination of the two things I mentioned earlier, to say, first, defendants cannot opt out of the act by waiver, to just try to discourage waivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.047" offset="7628846">But to say that mistakes will happen and that when a... a continuance... when a court grants a specific continuance that is authorized under the substantive standards of the act, that at that point in time, the defendant's waiver or other conduct that induces a court not to make the findings prevents the defendant from trying to seize on a purely procedural violation on appeal because at that point... remember, the... the reason for... for a... a partial anti waiver rule here is not that there's a specific anti waiver or anti estoppel provision in the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3461.077" offset="14000947">And it will make the court of appeals' job harder because they'll be guessing after the fact what discretionary decision the trial judge would have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.797" offset="14039817">This statute... the ends of justice provision is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.845" offset="14052043">The Government has cited no ambiguity, and it controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.049" offset="14064790">Because the findings were not made, whether they could have been made or should have been made or would have been made, they weren't made, and therefore, the time ran and dismissal is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.161" offset="14105228">Now, the Government proceeds under the false assumption that but for the waiver, the judge would have granted this continuance on January 31, 1997.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.882" offset="14144203">There's absolutely no support for that in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.538" offset="14158727">Even before this occasion, on November 8th, 1996, which was the prior court appearance, the court said you're not getting another adjournment unless you waive for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.963" offset="14196447">So there's no reason to think that at this later date the court was about to say, well, forget the waiver, okay, I'll give you 3 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.636" offset="14223197">It's... it's the waiver that is providing the basis for the exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.809" offset="14243886">The judge, if pushed, would have said, no, we're going to trial soon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.575" offset="14254962">No waiver, no more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.935" offset="14260395">So it's a false assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.685" offset="14267396">I'd like to turn to the second period again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.608" offset="14299056">The Government again assumes that when the judge found Mr. Zedner incompetent in March of 2001, that that is a retroactive determination that he was incompetent from July, August, September, October, November, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.519" offset="14362691">And as the Court is aware--</text>
