            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="89146">I have the opinion in 04-1084, Gonzales versus O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao Do Vegetal, or the UDV.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.875" offset="148601">The UDV is a Christian spiritist religious sect with roots in the Amazon Rainforest.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.953" offset="176917">Its members receive communion at religious services by drinking hoasca, a tea brewed from two plants found only in the Rainforest.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.297" offset="214325">Hoasca contains DMT, a hallucinogen regulated as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.625" offset="247553">The UDV has thousands of members in Brazil, but only about 130 in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.657" offset="275765">In 1999, the Federal Government intercepted a shipment of hoasca intended for the UDV in the United States, asserting that the Controlled Substances Act bars all use of the hallucinogen DMT.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.563" offset="331353">The church sued to establish its right to continue using the tea in its religious services.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.141" offset="357685">The UDV relied on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was passed in 1993.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.203" offset="385897">Under that statute, the Government may not substantially burdening a sincere exercise of religion unless it shows that the burden serves a compelling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.188" offset="425812">Before the main trial, the District Court heard evidence from both parties and concluded that the Government was not likely to show a compelling interest in this case and issued a preliminary injunction barring the Government from interfering with the church until the main trial is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.625" offset="491641">The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision, and we agreed to hear the Government’s challenge to the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.453" offset="522883">As the case came to us, there are number of salient points.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.828" offset="540437">First, the Government concedes that the UDV’s use of hoasca is a sincere exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.235" offset="570008">Second, the Government concedes that enforcing the Controlled Substances Act against the UDV would substantially burden that sincere exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.235" offset="613998">And third, the trial court looked at the evidence and found that the Government had not carried its burden of showing a compelling interest in preventing harm to church members from drinking hoasca or in preventing diversion of DMT from church members to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.688" offset="679827">The Government has not asked us to revisit these factual findings; instead, the Government’s main argument before us is a categorical one, that it has a compelling interest in the uniform application of the Controlled Substances Act so that no exception for the church can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.141" offset="753701">We reject that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.110" offset="761538">Congress, in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, required courts to consider exceptions to generally applicable laws on a case-by-case basis and to do so by examining the specific practices involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.750" offset="816082">The question under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is not whether DMT is harmful in general, but whether the Government has shown a compelling interest in stopping the UDV’s particular use of hoasca.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.875" offset="864565">The Government’s broad argument that it has a compelling interest in not allowing exceptions to the Controlled Substances Act is undermined by the fact that there already is an exception in the statute for the religious use of peyote, another Schedule I hallucinogenic substance, by the Native American Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.532" offset="939170">If an exception for use of a controlled substance is permitted for hundreds of thousands of Native Americans, we do not see why there can be no consideration of a similar exception for the 130 or so members of the church at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.063" offset="997371">The Government did not carry its burden of showing a compelling interest on the facts before the District Court; they cannot make up for the failure here by arguing that there can be no exceptions to the Controlled Substances Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.828" offset="1048362">For reasons stated more fully in an opinion filed this morning with the Clerk, we affirm that preliminary injunction allowing the UDV to continue to use hoasca in its religious services pending full trial on the merits and remain the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.031" offset="1113250">All members of the Court join the opinion except for Justice Alito, who did not participate in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
