            <text syncTime="3399.127" offset="13754237">But... but she was acting as a... a witness when... when she made the accusation to... to the officer, and characterizing it as an emergency I don't think helps anything in... in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.083" offset="13798123">The... the fact is that if we extend the emergency this far shows... well, it shows just how capable of expansion the... the theory is because there is an officer with her and there is an officer with... with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.883" offset="13853294">So the... the only question is should the officers leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.212" offset="13866564">That means that whenever there's... there's a victim potentially at large there, the confrontation right wouldn't... wouldn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.431" offset="13891537">The... the whole emergency doctrine really distorts incentives because a... a police officer who has a... a dual motive of creating... of protecting people, protecting the safety of... of people and gathering evidence... and I think it's clear that they do... under an emergency doctrine, would have an incentive to preserve the emergency or the appearance of emergency for... for as long as... for as long as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.296" offset="13990907">And I... I think the... the State encourages people to call, which of course they should do, but in part the reason why people are encouraged to call is to... is to create... is to pass on... is to pass on evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.628" offset="14044301">So I don't think that even if... even to the extent that the call is a... a cry for help, well, the help is... is seeking invitation of the... of the legal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.881" offset="14101248">In the Davis case, of course, it was an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.521" offset="14111801">In... in this case, the... the statement was not a cry for help.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.117" offset="14130192">It was in response to the second inquiry by the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.336" offset="14147119">The police officer was... was pressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.759" offset="14156836">And... and I... I think the... the emergency doctrine simply... simply can't... if... if there were an emergency doctrine, I think it's just badly founded and couldn't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.058" offset="14201976">If it pleases the Court, I believe Crawford has brought us to a remarkable crossroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.934" offset="14221516">If the accusation in this case is allowed to secure a conviction without the State providing an opportunity for confrontation, then the Confrontation Clause will be little more than a charade, easily abated by State officers gathering evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.562" offset="14276059">But if the Court proclaims that a conviction cannot be based on an accusation made privately to a known police officer, then it will take a long step to ensure that the confrontation right remains robust, as the Framers intended for centuries to come.</text>

            <text syncTime="3589.622" offset="14516281">I think what happened here resembled the inquisitorial practices in the key... in the key... in a key respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.327" offset="14539060">And I don't think the test Your Honor is proposing handles the message over the Internet or... or a letter, the... the tape made at the initiative of the... of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.799" offset="14584931">I think it... it utterly fails to get that because the... the prosecutors aren't involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.206" offset="14606560">But clearly the Confrontation Clause was written against the backdrop of private prosecution, the system of private prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.441" offset="14631534">So it has to fit those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.379" offset="14639266">I... I think that this case can be resolved on those very narrow grounds without trying to establish the broad, general meaning of the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.756" offset="14680748">I'm... I'm hoping that the Court is building a framework for hundreds of years to... to come, and I think it's more important that it be built right and that it be built quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.915" offset="14721395">And so I think an important first step is to say an accusation to a known police officer, whatever else is testimonial, that clearly must be.</text>
