          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="9.899" stopTime="353.332">
            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="9.899" offset="128499">Section 703 of the … of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act -- that’s the employment section -- forbids an employer from discriminating against an individual because of race, religion, gender or national origin with respect to “compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment”.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.875" offset="216480">Then you go to the next section, which is 704, and the next section forbids an employer from discriminating against an individual because that individual has filed a charge or assisted in an investigation of or imposed -- opposed an employer’s discriminatory behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.036" offset="289100">In other words it forbids retaliation when you complain about a Title VII violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.324" offset="314282">Now, in this case, we consider 704, the anti-retaliation provision, and what we do is, we are focusing on two matters that the lower courts have reached different conclusions about:  the first, we ask, “Well, does that anti-retaliation provision limit the kind of retaliation it forbids; two, retaliation that affects terms and conditions of an individual’s employment; or does it contain no such limitation, does it go further?”; second, we ask, ”How harmful must the forbidden retaliation be in order to fall within the scope of the provision which prohibits it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="100.105" offset="489407">Now, as to the first question, we find that the provision is not limited to retaliation; it affects the terms and conditions of an individual’s employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.750" offset="531934">It goes farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.258" offset="537995">It forbids retaliation that affects an individual outside of his job, say, serious harassment in his home, just is it forbids retaliation on the job, say, a demotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.261" offset="594001">The language of the statute suggests this.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.534" offset="603092">That’s why I read the text, because the text that I read that talks about limitations to employment is in the first part, the substantive provision, 703.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.007" offset="641022">No language like that is present in the second part, so why limit it?</text>
            <text syncTime="143.538" offset="663069">And moreover, common sense suggests the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.182" offset="677698">After all, a threat to hurt a person who files a complaint at that individual’s home or to file a false criminal charge against a victim of discrimination could be just as effective at stopping her from filling the complaint as a threat to reduce her pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.197" offset="757737">So limiting the anti-retaliation to employment-related acts would fail to fully achieve the provision’s purpose, which is to prevent employers from interfering with employees’ efforts to invoke Title VII’s protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.113" offset="817400">As to the second question, we hold that the anti-retaliation provision protects an individual not from all conceivable retaliation, but from retaliation that produces a significant injury or harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.348" offset="878318">Of course, you want to know what's meant by “significant”.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.646" offset="895559">Well, we say what it means is, we adopt the standard that’s been used by the 7th Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.832" offset="928264">They say and we say, to show that an injury or harm is significant, the plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the employer’s retaliatory action materially adverse, which in this context means that it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.467" offset="1018857">We use the term “material” to separate out, because they are not actionable, trivial harms.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.407" offset="1042576">We refer to the reactions of a reasonable person, because we think the standard for judging harm must be objective, as it is in other Title VII context.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.886" offset="1080506">We phrase the standard in general terms, because the significance of any given retaliatory act will often depend upon particular circumstances; that is to say, context matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.135" offset="1129511">A worker’s schedule change may normally make little difference to a worker; but suppose that that worker is a young mother with children, then it could matter enormously.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.816" offset="1172248">A supervisor’s refusal to invite an employee to lunch is normally just a petty slight; but to retaliate by excluding an employee from a weekly training lunch might well dissuade a reasonable employee from coming forward with a discrimination complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.122" offset="1241420">Finally, we apply the standard to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.924" offset="1256675">The plaintiff, the only woman working as a railroad-track laborer in the railroad's Tennessee yard complained about sexual harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.799" offset="1296173">Subsequently, she was subject to a change of duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.184" offset="1309652">Her duty was changed from forklift operator to ordinary track worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.993" offset="1328878">Then she made some more complaints, and after that she was charged with insubordination and suspended without pay for 37 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.118" offset="1365449">Eventually, the railroad found her innocent of insubordination and gave her back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.689" offset="1387706">In our view, the jury could lawfully find in the circumstance that the reassignment of her job duties, and the 37-day suspension without pay, even though she later got back pay, they still could find that that constituted unlawful retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.387" offset="1450504">We explain all these matters more fully in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.702" offset="1463774">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals, which found in her favor, is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.526" offset="1483105">Justice Alito has filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
