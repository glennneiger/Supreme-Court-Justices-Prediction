            <label>Ms. Jennifer G. Perkell</label>
            <text syncTime="7.813" offset="180803">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="10.940" offset="193238">The question presented in this case is whether, in enacting the Prison Litigation Reform Act's exhaustion requirement, Congress intended to require inmates to comply with administrative grievance procedures or whether Congress intended to permit inmates to ignore those procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.537" offset="255618">Petitioners submit that Congress intended to require inmates to comply with administrative grievance procedures, for three principal reasons--</text>
            <text syncTime="35.804" offset="292712">One, the established principle of exhaustion in the administrative law context requires a grievance... a grievant to timely comply with administrative agency proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.649" offset="340150">Two, in enacting the Prison Litigation Reform Act's exhaustion requirement, Congress was responding to this Court's decision in McCarthy v. Madigan, in which this Court presumed that an express or mandatory exhaustion requirement for prisoners would necessitate compliance with prison filing deadlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.092" offset="413920">And, three, Congress's objectives in enacting the Prison Litigation Reform Act's exhaustion requirement are directly facilitated by a rule in which inmates must comply with administrative grievance procedures, including filing deadlines; whereas, those objectives are invariably subverted when an inmate is permitted to ignore those procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.566" offset="499811">In the administrative law context, the established principle of exhaustion generally requires that a grievant comply with administrative agency proceedings in a proper and timely manner in order to be able to proceed to Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.209" offset="566371">In this case, Congress has, indeed, enacted an administrative exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.022" offset="589568">Even the Court of Appeals that in so doing Congress was attempting to bring the exhaustion rule for prisoners more into line with established administrative exhaustion rules that apply in other contexts.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.714" offset="640350">What do you say to the argument that that really is an inapposite because the 1983 proceeding is de novo?</text>

            <text syncTime="134.653" offset="688101">However, I would suggest it's irrelevant for purposes of how Congress would have understood the term "exhaust" in enacting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.186" offset="718299">The definition of the "principle of exhaustion" in administrative law is one in which there's an obligation to comply with the agency's grievance proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.439" offset="759259">And so, that is the definition of exhaustion that Congress was presumably... I would suggest was presumably invoking in this context.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.144" offset="790083">But that's the... a function of... you want the first line decisionmaker... you need that decision, because, at the second rung, in... at the court level, deference is owed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.661" offset="840134">But in the prison setting, there's no deference owed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.459" offset="855390">So, I would think that this kind of requirement, that you must file someplace else first, a place that won't get deference, is more like the EEOC example and the Age Discrimination Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.326" offset="1002825">And with respect to the EEOC context, we think that that is inapposite, because primarily that... the relevant statutes in those contexts invoke the word "commence", which--</text>

            <text syncTime="238.565" offset="1103762">Moreover, under those statutes Congress has limited the meaning of "commencement" in such a way that this Court has interpreted Congress to expressly preclude the possibility of a procedural default by virtue of a failure to comply with State filing provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.521" offset="1423605">There was a predecessor act, and the predecessor act used this same language, just about.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.553" offset="1439697">And what it said was,</text>
            <text syncTime="325.038" offset="1449623">"Judge, you may require exhaustion of such remedies as are available. "</text>
            <text syncTime="330.492" offset="1471461">And, given that language, nobody thought that was a procedure default rule; it just meant the judge, if there's a remedy available, can say, "Prisoner, go do it", in an appropriate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.589" offset="1527886">And all that happened here, if you look at the history, is, they changed the "may" to a "must".</text>
            <text syncTime="349.903" offset="1549097">And all the people that wrote in were writing in about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.560" offset="1567801">Nobody dreamt, nobody said, nothing suggests, that what Congress intended to do was to bring in the procedural default aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.000" offset="1613463">And there would have been a lot of objections if they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.643" offset="1632062">So, that's the argument the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.783" offset="1640630">Now, I'd like to know what do you have at all that overcomes what I just said?</text>

            <label>Ms. Jennifer G. Perkell</label>
            <text syncTime="378.644" offset="1664036">Well, I would suggest that, in part, the language of the CRIPA, which is... I believe, is... that's how I pronounce it; I believe that's what Your Honor is referring to... in part, precluded the possibility of a default... procedural default bar largely because it required a continuance of a case for 90... or I believe it started out as 180 days, and then became 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.837" offset="1784826">And... in order to permit the judge to order the inmate to go back and exhaust... and under those circumstances, even if he had been untimely by virtue of the continuance language, he was, nonetheless, permitted to return to Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.309" offset="1842714">So, I think by virtue of the language of the statute, it's at least possible that Congress had a... deliberately excluded that possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.687" offset="1884301">Moreover, I think that the statutory history and the statutory purposes in this case support the conclusion that Congress intended inmates to require with applicable grievance proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.955" offset="1929336">And if I may refer to the statutory history, in this Court... excuse me, in Booth v. Churner, this Court recognized that this Court's prior decision in McCarthy v. Madigan constituted a substantial of the statutory history from the PLRA's exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.193" offset="1998299">And, in relevant part, for purposes of the question presented here, that decision observed that... or assumed that an exhaustion... a mandatory exhaustion requirement for prisoners would necessitate the compliance of administrative filing deadlines.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.704" offset="2180320">It was one of two grounds upon which this Court relied in holding that this Court would not judicially impose a mandatory exhaustion requirement for prisoners under that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.301" offset="2234759">So, the first part of this decision evaluated the text of the former version of 1997(e), and, in the second part of this decision, this Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="534.585" offset="2287840">"Nonetheless, notwithstanding that the statute doesn't expressly require exhaustion, we will not judicially impose exhaustion in this case for the reason that such a requirement would, indeed, represent a possibility of forfeiture of a claim for an inmate's failure to comply with deadlines. "</text>
            <text syncTime="553.229" offset="2362446">And, again, as this Court recognized in Booth v. Churner, that decision is a significant part of the statutory history of this provision, and this Court presumed that Congress was responding to that decision when it revised 1997(e).</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.146" offset="4982110">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.572" offset="5031847">The United States agrees with Petitioners' submission that the Ninth Circuit's decision is inconsistent with the text, history, and purposes of the PLRA exhaustion requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.683" offset="5076255">We would add that the Ninth Circuit's decision has consequences that Congress could not have intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.699" offset="5104258">To begin with, under the Ninth Circuit's interpretation, a prisoner can wait years to file an administrative claim, such that it is virtually certain that the prison will reject the claim as untimely and not decide the claim on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.969" offset="5165385">That is hardly different from not requiring an exhaustion requirement... not requiring exhaustion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.033" offset="5193597">Indeed, Respondent candidly concedes... this is on page 43 of his brief... that, under his interpretation, if the prison system does not give prison decisionmakers any discretion to decide an untimely claim, the prisoner would not have to file an administrative claim at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.849" offset="5268934">All he would have to do is wait for the filing deadline to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.882" offset="5288996">In addition, if the Ninth Circuit's interpretation is correct, the PLRA would be the only context in the law in which a claimant who is required to exhaust would be able to get into Federal Court by virtue of untimely exhaustion; that is, without complying with filing deadlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.761" offset="5368513">It would be odd, to put it mildly, if Congress intended to adopt such a uniquely forgiving exhaustion rule as part of a statute whose very purpose was to combat abusive litigation by prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.296" offset="5426714">Respondent's submission is that the administrative law principle, the established administrative law principle, that exhaustion requires compliance with the agency's procedural rules, is inapplicable here, because what we're dealing with is what he calls an original proceeding rather than a review proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1361.320" offset="5594838">It doesn't involve administrative exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.649" offset="5604137">And, of course, the Court abandoned that principle, which was the deliberate bypass exception to the procedural default rule, years ago, I believe in 1977, in favor of the cause and prejudice exception in Wainwright versus Sykes, which was subsequently codified by Congress in AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.747" offset="5676549">But there is no administrative exhaustion context, of which we are aware, where untimely exhaustion is sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.835" offset="5848852">It is the case that what is required under the PLRA is exhaustion of available administrative remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.847" offset="8268941">But even in the administrative law context, this is dramatically different from most administrative law circumstances, because in those situations you have an administrative decision that is in some way being reviewed, the administrative agency record may have some effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.266" offset="8486593">And I think that both opposing counsel have made a point of saying that the Oscar Mayer case pointed out that it was not an exhaustion requirement in Oscar Mayer, but, rather, that it used the word "commence".</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.067" offset="8549809">But I think it's important to look at what the Court said it meant by saying it wasn't an exhaustion requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2275.819" offset="9252817">And there are least three ways that it is still meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.914" offset="9265146">The first is, it removes any rational incentive for the prisoner to evade the grievance system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.731" offset="9344454">But going back to the incentives, there are two basic reasons why an inmate might rationally want to evade the grievance process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.202" offset="9378309">And, I mean, there's this notion here of prisoners scheming to get around the grievance process and deliberate bypass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.109" offset="9401923">And it's completely overblown, because the... there are two basic reasons the prisoner might want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.955" offset="9429300">First, if proceeding with the grievance and having it adjudicated in the prison grievance system could somehow harm his later Federal suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2333.099" offset="9481858">Neither one of these things happens under the PLRA, even without a procedural default rule being read into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.538" offset="9519683">On the first thing, the prisoner is not affected in Federal Court, unlike, say, a habeas case, where a prisoner may want to evade a State Court decision, because that decision will get deference in the later Federal habeas proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2764.469" offset="11207403">But the other thing is, even if the State... assuming the State doesn't address it, the prisoner, again, has to not just file that; there is an appeals process that normally he'll have to go through, although, in this case, the California... the... excuse me... the prison appeals coordinator just said,</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.841" offset="11744898">There is nothing requiring the State to speed it through the appeals process if the State feels that it's important for the prisoner not to be able to get to Federal Court as quickly as possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2929.098" offset="11865897">And the ways in which this requires a prisoner to file, and delays him, are significant in many of the same ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.006" offset="11901528">But the other very important point here is that in considering the reasonableness of doing this with or without a procedural default requirement, sure, with procedural... excuse me, a procedural default rule... with that, of course, you're going to make the provision somewhat more effective, but there's a tradeoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.557" offset="11987732">And the tradeoff is, you're going to make it more effective by kicking prisoners out of court on a nonmerits ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.622" offset="12023990">And Congress... the sponsors of the legislation made it clear they were not meaning to kick out potentially meritorious claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.984" offset="12081460">You also are creating another bad incentive, which is, with this procedural default rule, the prison officials have the incentive to try to get rid of cases on nonmerits grounds, because if they rule on a... on a procedural ground, then the prisoner can't file.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.551" offset="12155752">If they rule... if they address it on the merits, then the prisoner has the chance of going there.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.066" offset="12441741">And I guess I didn't touch on the language, but there are numerous textual indications, as we argue in detail in our brief, even aside from getting to the word "exhausted", that Congress contemplated simple exhaustion, and there's no sign of any contemplation of a procedural default rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.571" offset="12527840">The word AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.745" offset="12588444">There was... at one point, there were provisions in the same bill that... one of which was an exhaustion provision in AEDPA, and one of which was the early version of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.310" offset="12638704">There's no indication that exhaustion was used in different contexts there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.937" offset="12653228">And the habeas cases make clear that a defaulted claim is exhausted, and it's a timely requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.454" offset="12679350">On the legislative history, if there was an expectation that there would be this sort of procedural default rule and prisoners would forfeit claims... and, as you can tell with 2 or 3-day filing deadlines some places, and other technical requirements elsewhere... there would be expected to be a number of forfeitures, no indication in the legislative history that Congress thought one of the ways the PLRA would reduce suits was by causing forfeitures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.523" offset="12799618">And, in addition, it's important to understand that, although, as we concede, the provision will be... will not be as effective without a procedural default rule, but it still does have some effect without the procedural default rule, the problem with imposing a procedural default rule is that the consequences of that are very troubling, because what you'd be doing then is essentially incorporating every State, and local jail facility, for that matter, filing deadline as a de factor statute of limitations--</text>
