            <text syncTime="11.381" offset="206563">For centuries the knock and announce rule has been a core part of the right of the people to be secure in their houses from unreasonable searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.438" offset="242821">It reflects the notion that when the government has the right to enter a house, whether to perform an arrest, to search for evidence, or to seize goods, that the people should have the right to answer the door in a dignified manner, except in an emergency, and to avoid the unnecessarily gratuitous embarrassment and shock that often follows a precipitous police entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="54.007" offset="377090">Well, this Court has recognized in Wilson, consistent with the common law authorities, Mr. Chief Justice, that they are connected, that the entry directly affects the reasonableness of the search and seizure that occurs within.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.358" offset="430485">And that's why this Court in Miller and in Sabbath suppressed the evidence following knock and announce violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.786" offset="452219">But in Wilson, this Court directly stated that the common law, the Fourth Amendment,... the common law that informs the Fourth Amendment, directly demonstrates that the Framers thought that the method of entry directly affects whether a search or seizure inside a home is reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3524.064" offset="14257306">The... the warrant authorized a search for guns because Officer Good told the magistrate that in his experience guns were often associated with drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.721" offset="14291892">But they had no particularized information about any guns on the premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="3544.756" offset="14340062">And as Justice Breyer articulated, when an officer is illegally in the home, that causes his seizure of goods or his arrest of people in the home to be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.036" offset="14393247">If I can go all the way back to 1831, Chief Justice Shaw of the Massachusetts Supreme Court said, the rule is well established... this is 1831 it was well established... that where an authority given by law is exceeded, the party loses the benefit of his justification and the law holds him a trespasser ab initio although, to a certain extent, he followed the authority given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.354" offset="14470465">The law will operate to defeat all acts thus done under color of lawful authority when exceeded and a fortiori will it operate to prospectively to prevent the acquisition of any lawful right by the excess and abuse of an authority given for useful and beneficial purposes.</text>
