            <label>Mr. James Bopp, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.814" offset="185524">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.324" offset="191584">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="12.512" offset="200257">As this Court made clear recently in Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, since political candidates are the ones who take office, it is imperative that they be allowed freely to express themselves on matters of current public importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.453" offset="256055">As a result, this Court has never allowed the government to prohibit candidates from communicating relevant information to voters during an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.111" offset="294716">Vermont, however, has adopted low expenditure and contribution limits for the opposite purpose, reducing overall candidate campaign spending, and these limits would have that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.457" offset="340064">This is fundamentally incompatible with any reasonable interpretation of the First Amendment and is not justified by any truly compelling governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.366" offset="379771">As a result, they are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.138" offset="390847">Now, Vermont's expenditure limits are an unprecedented, direct restraint on candidate speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.691" offset="417073">Once these low expenditure limits are exhausted, a candidate may not drive to the village green to address a rally, may not return the phone call from a reporter at the local newspaper, and may not call a neighbor to urge her to get out to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.503" offset="480290">This Court has never allowed the government to prohibit candidates from communicating this sort of relevant information during a campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.478" offset="516130">Further, this Court has long held that more speech is better than less speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.427" offset="535983">As long as contribution limits are available to address any realistic concerns about corruption, the public will benefit from candidates' being allowed to spend all that they can lawfully raise in their campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.211" offset="591153">Now, the record is clear in this case that the expenditure limits will deprive candidates of substantial resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.098" offset="622605">The district court erroneously looked at average spending over the last three elections and found that in all but one category, that is, Senate candidates running in single member districts, that the average spending for all candidates in those campaigns were below the limits set by the expenditure limits in Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.275" offset="703375">However, in Buckley, the last case for... where this Court considered candidate expenditure limits, the Court looked at the number of races affected, not the average spending in all races.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.887" offset="765756">And in Buckley, the Court looked at the expenditures in U.S. Senate races and found that in previous election, that 26 percent were over the mandatory expenditure limits considered in Buckley, and in the House, 3 percent of the races had spending greater than the... these limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.159" offset="986856">They found that these two interests that the State is alleging, that is, in preventing corruption and in conserving incumbent time, were together a compelling governmental interest, and we... we allege that they are not and that on this record, this Court can determine that they are not... they are not together a compelling governmental interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.140" offset="1094794">Well, the... this Court has now considered, including this case, a dozen times in which the government has sought to limit expenditures, either of candidates or PAC's or political parties, and despite the work of the most brilliant lawyers in the United States, they have not come up with any compelling governmental interest that this Court has accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.295" offset="1179431">And we believe that this record demonstrates that these claimed interests either are not compelling or are not proven.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.706" offset="1261038">For example, take the... the problem of candidate time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.221" offset="12795144">And very importantly, when Buckley declared that the interest in deterring corruption and its appearance was not adequate to support the expenditure limits, that was on a record in which neither spending nor contributions had been subject to meaningful limits prior to the time of FECA and the amendments that the Court was considering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.372" offset="12871735">There simply was no record to show the Court of how contribution limits alone would really work to address the problem of corruption and the appearance of... of corruption and encouraging public confidence in government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.890" offset="13965847">The one example that they keep going back to regarding the President of the Senate tells the breadth of this challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.433" offset="13987999">As long as Vermont allows periodic elections, incumbents are going to consider the effect that their votes have on future elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.163" offset="14022899">And... and while it makes it more scandalous to say we will lose the food manufacturers' money, what they are concerned about is losing the food manufacturers' support.</text>

            <text syncTime="3487.824" offset="14101580">Now, secondly, as to the effect on challengers, the record demonstrates that challengers... and there's expert testimony to the fact that challengers are more frequently challenged in primaries than are incumbents, and the Randall brief on pages 16 and 17 point out the testimony of people who have been subject to a primary and demonstrates that they are not able to mount an effective campaign in the general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.527" offset="14204398">Furthermore, the expenditure limits have the perverse result of depriving challengers of more money than incumbents, probably making them attractive to incumbents.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Bopp, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3537.803" offset="14301469">It comes about because challengers frequently in Vermont actually spend more than do incumbents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.857" offset="14329681">I... I know that... that the general perception is the opposite, but the general perception is not true in Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.994" offset="14354236">And... and that points to the... the fact that the way this law is constructed strongly suggests that is... it is seeking to favor incumbents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.996" offset="14398226">Furthermore, we had expert witness testimony on the effect of contribution limits on competitive races.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.077" offset="14430618">The... we had... Mr. McNeil testified in examining the competitive races in the 1998 election that the vast majority in both the House and the Senate would not be able to mount an effective campaign with the available resources that would have been available after imposing the contribution limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.076" offset="14522569">And, of course, these were in the amounts of 28 percent in the Senate, 22 percent in the House, which is way beyond the 5.1 percent that this Court in Buckley thought that could be made up by the imposition of a $1,000 limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.287" offset="14587457">I mean, this... this law is so constructed that it would make it virtually impossible for, for instance, countywide candidates in Chittenden County, a county of 150,000, the largest county in Vermont... they would be limited to $4,000 for the primary and the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.720" offset="14677109">That's 3 cents for each person in Chittenden County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.252" offset="14695291">And, of course, this is an important county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.106" offset="14702709">Senator Leahy came from that county as State's attorney and became the United States Senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.899" offset="14725906">And finally, with respect to the rebuttable presumption, actually the... the statute answers the question of whether or not this presumption disappears.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.829" offset="14773553">If you look at 2809, subsection (e), the last sentence says, the findings and determination of the court... and this is in this court proceeding by your opponent that is trying to claim that this spending over here is actually yours... that the findings and the determination of the court shall be prima facie evidence in any proceeding brought for violation of the chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.022" offset="14870311">So it doesn't go away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.033" offset="14874386">The rebuttable presumption never goes away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.210" offset="14883059">And, in fact, each person... each candidate and each independent spender can look at the rebuttable presumption requirement and say, I have to file a report and that governs my report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.411" offset="14939901">Thank you.</text>
