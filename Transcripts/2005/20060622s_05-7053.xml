            <text syncTime="8.135" offset="121171">In this case, the petitioner made some purchases of firearms at a gun show and violated two criminal statutes when she did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.091" offset="157011">She was receiving a firearm when under indictment, and she made false statements in connection with the purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.480" offset="186582">At trial, she did not deny committing the offenses or any of the elements of the offenses, but rather she pleaded the affirmative defense of duress, testifying that she had a boyfriend who had seriously threatened or threatened serious harms to herself and to her two daughters.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.833" offset="255963">The issue that the case turns on is whether -- on the issue of duress, she had the burden of proving that defense by a preponderance of the evidence or, as she contends, it was the Government’s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not act under duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.808" offset="335898">For reasons stated in the opinion we filed with the Clerk, we agree with the Government’s view that she had the burden of proof on the affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.348" offset="374037">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Alito has filed a concurring opinion that Justice Scalia has joined; and Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion that Justice Souter has joined.</text>
