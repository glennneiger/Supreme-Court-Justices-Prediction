            <text syncTime="102.147" offset="565002">My question is, Do we know, from the record, whether the tax that is assessed on the distributor is, in fact, passed through to the tribe so that, in economic effect, the tribe is collecting, via pass through, the State tax and imposing its own tax and still selling at market prices?</text>

            <text syncTime="3590.487" offset="14518360">So they wouldn't be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.235" offset="14525361">But they make sense, because the sales to other States are for people that drive on other States' highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.722" offset="14547304">The sales to the United States Government is an exchange for almost the same amount of money that comes back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.317" offset="14569665">So, there's a rational purpose.</text>
