            <text syncTime="14.940" offset="207124">A Federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over a claim brought under title VII regardless of whether an employer has 15 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.129" offset="243904">This is so because when Congress enacted title VII, it included a specific jurisdictional grant and that grant provides that jurisdiction will exist in the Federal courts over all claims brought under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.289" offset="308583">This specific grant of jurisdiction is consistent with the more general grant of jurisdiction contained in 28 U.S.C. 1331 wherein Federal question jurisdiction exists over all claims that arise under a Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.324" offset="376711">Title VII is a Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.543" offset="385592">The Fifth Circuit erred when it... when it determined that the employer numerosity issue went to subject matter jurisdiction of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.420" offset="421119">Indeed, when title VII was passed, Congress actually expanded jurisdiction, the Federal question issue of title VII, because at that time 28 U.S.C. 1331 had a $10,000 amount in controversy requirement that Congress did away with because the jurisdictional grant contained within title VII made no mention of the $10,000 requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.630" offset="537938">Now that 1331 has no jurisdictional amount, no amount in controversy, the jurisdictional provision in title VII is just going over the same territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.084" offset="831764">An example would be a case perhaps where a... in fact, a case that I'm currently involved in where a plaintiff is alleging that they were discharged discriminatorily.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.339" offset="944717">It seems to me that the number of employee issue is whether you're covered at all, whether you have to conform your conduct to that law.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.873" offset="1006889">--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but I believe that the analogy applies because it still goes to whether or not you start reading the act beyond the jurisdictional grant.</text>

I would not necessarily agree that that goes beyond the jurisdictional grant because the jurisdictional grant of... contained in 1334... 1343 requires that... that jurisdiction apply against a person acting under color of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.555" offset="1189641">And that's an example which Congress has done many times of putting qualifiers within a jurisdictional grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.667" offset="1214092">An example of... of that we... we attached 60 such statutes to our appendix in our reply brief, but a specific example, which I think is applicable here, is the Uniformed Service Employee Reemployment Rights Act wherein Congress put in that the act would only apply jurisdictionally, subject matter jurisdictionally, against employers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1060.182" offset="4388178">Technically we think the answer is yes, but it still has great interpretive value because it shows that when Congress meant to address the jurisdictional question in title VII, it expressly said so and it did so by conferring jurisdiction over all title VII claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.798" offset="4506565">Well, as the Court has remarked on multiple occasions, the word jurisdiction is a word of many, many meanings, and the EEOC has never said that it's a question of a subject matter jurisdiction in the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.346" offset="4544809">It was... until about 5 or 6 years ago, EEOC in an administrative context used the word jurisdiction to refer to the definition of employer, statutes of limitations, and a variety of other matters that are clearly not subject matter jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.632" offset="4597889">But after this Court held in Zipes that another provision of title VII is not one of subject matter jurisdiction, EEOC realized that its administrative use of the broad term jurisdiction was confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.884" offset="4638954">So 5 or 6 years ago, EEOC amended its compliance manual and no longer refers to any of these questions as jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.587" offset="4665808">But I guess the key point is it never said it was on subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.729" offset="4682317">And Mr. Chief Justice, you asked about whether a threshold question of coverage could be considered different than another element of the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.169" offset="4712097">I think the important thing here is that the place where Congress used the term person is in setting forth what conduct is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.405" offset="4745011">Title VII says that it shall be an unlawful employment practice for a person to discriminate in various ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.328" offset="4768730">So the way the definition is irrelevant is in setting forth the scope of unlawful conduct which is a quintessential merits or cause of action inquiry as opposed to a jurisdictional one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.687" offset="5066108">And Justice Scalia, you asked about the... the practical consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.487" offset="5089305">I agree there are three practical consequences, and from that perspective, it makes little sense to believe that Congress would have thought that this requirement should be jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.893" offset="5115009">The first is whether the issue can be raised at any point in the litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.115" offset="5167881">And given that this is just one of many facts that arises in determining whether a plaintiff can state a valid title VII claim, it's hard to believe that Congress would have thought that this is the one fact that should be raised at the end of the case instead of at the outset where it can be adjudicated in an orderly manner with all of the other facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1384.409" offset="5685001">So Congress had to distinguish in some way, and the way it did was by saying, well, is the alleged injury caused by a vessel in navigable waters or elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="1396.630" offset="5733902">In section 1343, it was the same because Congress didn't want that to be conflated with section 1331 at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.100" offset="5755845">When jurisdiction does not necessarily turn on contextual factors, Congress ordinarily just lets the broad jurisdictional ground of section 1331 be a clear, simple threshold inquiry so parties can determine they're in the right court, and then the case can be proceeded... can be litigated on the merits from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.682" offset="5818121">Justice Kennedy asked whether a court could raise the issue on its own, even assuming that it's a merits issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.386" offset="5848946">And I think the answer is that although the defendant waived the issue here and therefore has no right to insist that it be raised, most waiver doctrines are discretionary, and therefore, courts retain some inherent discretion to overlook waivers in some circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.359" offset="5904848">That discretion would be greater at the outset of a case where a Federal court decided it should not be deciding a case than it would be once a jury had already decided a case, which is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.970" offset="5943300">Finally, respondent relies on a number of this Court's title VII decisions for the proposition that this requirement is one of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.207" offset="5992201">The basic point is that this Court has never opined in dicta or in holding on whether this requirement is one of subject matter jurisdiction of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.209" offset="6024280">The Court's only title VII subject matter jurisdiction case is Zipes which held that a requirement was not jurisdictional because it was not... did not textually modify title VII's broad jurisdictional provision and in light of other relevant canons of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.540" offset="6081540">And for precisely the same reasons, the definition of employer does not textually modify the definitional provision and therefore it does not limit the court's subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate this claim either up or down based on its merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2524.609" offset="10245876">The police officer, in general, can be sued under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.751" offset="10262386">The immunity that's present here, with respect to small employers, has no relationship whatsoever to the actions of that employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.003" offset="10307421">An employer who employs 12 people at most can engage in the most egregious employment discrimination and harassment possible, and the Congress of the United States has said, as a policy matter, on balance we would rather accept that kind of awful conduct because we don't want to impose these burdens on small businesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2749.126" offset="11143862">The Solicitor General indicated that if you look at the structure of the... the liability section, he implied that it just imposes the employer definition into the... all the other causes of action.</text>
