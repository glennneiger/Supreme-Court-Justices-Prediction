            <text syncTime="5.923" offset="170740">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--</text>
            <text syncTime="8.955" offset="182861">In cases involving safety exigencies, an officer's actions should be judged against a single objective standard of reasonableness, that is, whether the facts and circumstances known to the officers at the time of entry would warrant a reasonable person in believing that immediate intervention is needed to preserve the peace and protect others from harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.102" offset="295501">When officers have reason to believe that violence is imminent or ongoing, they meet that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.416" offset="328728">In this case, the Brigham City officers responded to a complaint at 3:00 a.m. and, upon arriving, witnessed a violent and tumultuous struggle between four adults and a teenager.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.216" offset="383899">The officers... when the juvenile threw a punch is when the officers acted and thereby prevented injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.046" offset="423292">This is exactly what we would expect officers to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="77.626" offset="457564">They couldn't have seen that until they went into the fenced back yard violating the curtilage of the property.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Gray</label>
            <text syncTime="87.910" offset="498733">Yes, it was justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.285" offset="508242">At that time what they heard from the curb side and then from the front was the same kind of violence going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.115" offset="535514">They heard that from... from the time they arrived all the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.021" offset="551187">They... they heard the thumping, the shouting, someone saying, get off me, stop, stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.367" offset="580549">And so what these officers were doing, in the course of that, is investigating that... that, and it led them to the back yard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.474" offset="12081009">What we have, Your Honors, is a situation where under the exigent circumstances, it did not rise to the level which would require the... the officers to enter the home without getting a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.445" offset="12124895">And in the alternative, if they look at emergency aid, to enter the home under the emergency aid doctrine, which would be the equivalent in our opinion to a special needs assessment, then we have to look at probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.042" offset="12183200">We have to look at their intent to enter because there's no probable cause to enter if they're performing that caretaking role to protect people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.684" offset="12213816">Obviously, the ultimate concern in... in any type of situation is somebody's sanctity of their home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.575" offset="12237326">It becomes a weighing situation where trial courts are... are being charged to weigh the evidence, weigh the credibility of the people who testify, and then also take into account the constitutional protections which the parties are awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.251" offset="12292078">And we believe that based upon the facts and the evidence that were... was presented, that the three different Utah courts that heard this matter were appropriate in their... in their suppression decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.552" offset="12385283">Disorderly conduct is a class C misdemeanor, punishable by up to 90 days in jail under the... how it was charged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.446" offset="12424885">Also intoxication is a class C misdemeanor, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor is a class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to 6 months in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.057" offset="12467308">So that's... that's what... but the officers... and again, this case isn't about what they were ultimately charged with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.668" offset="12493744">It's whether or not they had a reasonable basis to believe that immediate intervention was necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.821" offset="12730309">Counsel, you have... you have two questions presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.384" offset="12752565">The second is whether this was sufficiently... sufficiently exigent to fall under the exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.775" offset="12778165">But the first was whether the test should turn on the officer's subjective motivation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Gray</label>
            <text syncTime="3166.887" offset="12814632">Well, the court created two different tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.436" offset="12828843">The Utah court created two different tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.060" offset="12839292">And under the one test, it examined whether or not the officers were primarily motivated by a desire to arrest or search for evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.203" offset="12879834">Now, the court, the Utah Supreme Court, concluded that they did... that they were... their motives were primarily law enforcement motives because they did not render aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.752" offset="12930093">And this Court has repeatedly held that an officer's subjective motives play no part in the objective reasonableness test, and it should not do so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.240" offset="12976069">Justice Ginsburg, you indicated that there was no... no suggestion of domestic violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.960" offset="13010864">The Utah Supreme Court actually acknowledged that where violence is seen in a home between adults and, for example, a younger person, that there would be reason to believe that domestic violence is possibly present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.385" offset="13076588">And that's what... now, the court refused to look at that because there was no finding that the inhabitants or the... those involved were actually cohabitants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.279" offset="13116189">Of course, this Court has never required that officers have a certainty of the situation, only a reasonable belief, and they clearly have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.562" offset="13157358">And in any event, whether or not it's domestic violence or some other type of violence, it's something that I believe this Court in Mincey recognized, that officers can and... and probably should... maybe they didn't go far, but it would be our position that officers should intervene in the face of violence, and that's what the officers did here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3273.286" offset="13240219">My point was simply that this was not a 911 call from a distressed spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.241" offset="13268013">This was a neighbor saying they're keeping me up at night, so that the... the police response was to the noise, not to the violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3293.588" offset="13321407">The initial response was clearly to the noise, but once the officers arrived, it became apparent that there was violence ongoing in the house and that's how the officers proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.105" offset="13363517">If there are no further questions, we would ask the Court to reverse the decision of the Utah Supreme Court.</text>
