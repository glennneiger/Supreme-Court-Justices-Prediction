            <text syncTime="11.518" offset="195822">The question presented today is whether a claim for contractual reimbursement is cognizable under section 502(a)(3) of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.015" offset="241902">In this case, MAMSI, the fiduciary of an ERISA plan, seeks monetary reimbursement from the Sereboffs, two beneficiaries of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.867" offset="285265">MAMSI has consistently taken the position that its money claim is governed exclusively by the terms of its contract with the Sereboffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.603" offset="328210">This contract expressly disclaims and replaces most equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.668" offset="360497">At its core, MAMSI's claim is nothing more than a request for money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.388" offset="387351">This claim is not cognizable under ERISA because MAMSI is not entitled to any relief that was typically available at equity.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.490" offset="1323789">--See, I don't think that's true, though, because there's a distinction I'd like to draw between having a remedy under 502(a)(3) of ERISA and having a remedy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.148" offset="1362346">We would suggest that the plan can intervene in the State court suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.524" offset="1379900">We would suggest that the plan could write a letter to the tortfeasor notifying the tortfeasor that it has a subrogation right, and if the tortfeasor entered into a release, it wouldn't be viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.204" offset="1430577">So there may be good reason for the Federal court to enter the injunction that you suggested, Mr. Chief Justice, merely to prevent the dissipation of the funds because the funds might need to be preserved for a separate purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.802" offset="1520961">It's an old case but it involved a situation similar to this, namely, a contingent fee arrangement with a lawyer, and the client received all the money, without giving the lawyer his contingent fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.781" offset="1588879">We reasoned in our opinion that, quote, the contract for a contingent fee out of a fund awarded constituted a lien upon the fund and that, quote, it is one of the familiar rules in equity that a contract to convey a specific object, even before it is acquired, will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets title to the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.708" offset="1680622">Why doesn't that absolutely resolve the present case?</text>

            <text syncTime="387.490" offset="1699743">That does not resolve the present case, Justice Scalia, because the... MAMSI's interpretation of the Barnes line of cases, the equitable lien by assignment cases, would entirely negate the limitation that Congress put into 502(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="403.868" offset="1765258">And... and if you'd permit me to explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.222" offset="1774662">A remedy of an equitable lien by assignment, as we explained in our opening brief, is not a restitutionary remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.377" offset="1803293">No unjust enrichment need be proved.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.986" offset="1821787">It's purely a contractual remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.580" offset="1832132">Now, as a result, courts of equity historically developed this remedy to give priority to one creditor over another if there was a present intent on the part of the promisor to pledge that specific property as security.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.517" offset="3763835">If we look at 502(g), there's a very narrow provision for plans to enforce terms that require certain employers to make contributions to plans, and in 502(g) Congress said, well, in this case you can seek liquidated damages to enforce the terms of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.188" offset="3850561">You can seek legal relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.814" offset="3873026">So when we sit here today and look at 502(a)(3), it's very easy, particularly on the facts of an individual case, to say, hey, you know, legal relief should be available here.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.705" offset="3984622">The first is that as a backdrop rule they believed that it's not a good policy to have fiduciaries suing participants and beneficiaries for money, and when they thought that there was a good reason like 502(g), they expressly enumerated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.099" offset="4054212">The second reason I think that they... they did this is because the only times when it might make sense to recover money for the violation of a plan term, for the most part, fall within... under the rubric of unjust enrichment.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.395" offset="4115338">And I believe that Congress, rightfully so, thought that there were sufficient nonERISA remedies whereby a plan could assert truly equitable unjust enrichment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.985" offset="4169777">So there was no need to provide that remedy in the civil enforcement provisions of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.962" offset="4189630">So if we look at that as the backdrop rule and apply it to Barnes and that line of cases, I would suggest that MAMSI's reading of the Barnes line of cases is very dangerous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.670" offset="4512504">There are 36 States that have limited the collateral source rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.785" offset="4528909">Under the MAMSI plan here, if a particular plaintiff recovered money in a personal injury suit, it clearly could not recover all, in some of the States, part in other States, of its advanced medical expenses because they came from a collateral source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.702" offset="4604559">Nonetheless, under the plan, as MAMSI has written it, they can recover their full amount, and there's nothing equitable in allowing a boiler plate provision to authorize the plan to get contract damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.579" offset="6520066">The second thing I would say, though, is that that notion runs square up against GreatWest because GreatWest said it had to be a claim that was traditionally available in equity, not something that an equity court would have jurisdiction over because of the cleanup doctrine, not something that could come into an equity court for another reason, but a remedy that was traditionally equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.590" offset="6604181">And when you're looking at something like a constructive trust, MAMSI is correct to point out that it doesn't matter if there's an adequate remedy at law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.443" offset="12743583">It would still be an equitable claim because the question still is are you enforcing the terms of the plan, and... and the equitable lien cases make quite clear that that court in equity will enforce that so long as a particular... so long as a particular fund, even if it has not yet come into existence, is what's been specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.150" offset="12814427">In fact, the cases that are cited by petitioners' counsel to the contrary, starting with the Trist case, was a case that was specifically disapproved in Barnes against Alexander as resting on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.252" offset="12854760">That was a case where the... there was a contingent fee for lobbying Congress and there was a statute that forbade it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.517" offset="12871897">There were two other grounds that the Court decided the case, and then Justice Holmes in the Barnes case went on to say... well, insofar as the question is open, he gave the answer, which is the question as to whether there's an equitable lien is determined by what the contract says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.291" offset="12926963">As far as the make whole doctrine, another point about the make whole doctrine that's worth keeping in mind is that insofar as some States have applied it, as a matter of their insurance law and have said, well, an insurance company is not allowed under our State's law to contract out of the make whole doctrine which we... under our State's law is the default rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.895" offset="13009405">Insofar as a State has said that, that would apply equally to ERISA plans under the insurance savings clause and there wouldn't be any question I think that it would.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.212" offset="13086623">And if the insurance contract departed from what the State's law was, the State's law would govern it under ERISA's insurance savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.332" offset="13111074">But where you have an... and so the... the case with ERISA plans is not really any different than it is outside ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.125" offset="13134270">Insofar as a State under its insurance law decides to establish a make whole doctrine or an allocation rule of some sort or a default rule, it can do that, and that can be applied to insured ERISA plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.478" offset="13179724">But as to uninsured ERISA plans, it wouldn't be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.827" offset="13193098">And that... this Court established that in its decision in FMC against Holliday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.375" offset="13211279">This case really actually arises... it was really... it was at the intersection of two distinct doctrines that... two distinct lines of cases that both support equitable relief in a case like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.815" offset="13269062">One is the... those that I've spoken about already, which is the equitable lien cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.514" offset="13283900">The other is the line of subrogation cases that Mr. Coleman spoke about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.963" offset="13301663">And from the very earliest times, it was recognized in subrogation cases that that gave the insurer not only a right to advance the insured's claim, but where the insured advanced the claim and got a recovery, he holds it as a trustee for the insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.435" offset="13367492">And that was recognized from the early... from the mid-18th century cases that Mr. Coleman cited in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.894" offset="13389330">It was recognized by this Court in Comegys... the Comegys case, written by Justice Story in the 1820's, and it's been a consistent rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.715" offset="13420677">And this is an appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan because it arises directly at the confluence of those two lines of equitable cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter K. Stris</label>
            <text syncTime="3333.160" offset="13482430">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.921" offset="13489431">In my limited time, I'd like to make three very brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.369" offset="13503224">The first point I'd like to make is why these claims are never permissible under 502(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.439" offset="13531541">And I think it comes out of a... a concession that Mr. Coleman made in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.050" offset="13550035">He answered your question, Mr. Chief Justice... and you said that they would have had this equitable right without any plan provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.853" offset="13577203">But, hey, they put the plan provision in because that's what section 502(a)(3) requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.151" offset="13598414">You can only get equitable relief to remedy the violation of a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.344" offset="13615133">That's why these claims are never authorized under 502(a)(3) because they're not really to... to enforce or remedy the violation of a plan term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.336" offset="13655152">More importantly, though, that's not what happened here because in this contract they disclaimed the very equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.817" offset="13689111">And that brings me to my second point, which is that even if the answer to the question we presented in our cert petition is sometimes, the question is still presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.986" offset="13729758">The answer to the question could be that, as you put it, Justice Souter, jurisdictionally sometimes these claims for reimbursement are authorized, and the sometimes is when the contract doesn't disclaim equitable principles because if the party relies on the contract and fails to establish the equitable principles that make the remedy equitable, then it's nothing more than a breach of contract damages case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.815" offset="13853056">And Mr. Coleman's answer was very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.087" offset="13862146">He tried to... to sort of squirm out of that by suggesting that, no, it's equitable because this was a preallocation of how the money would be distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.495" offset="13899763">Well, where I'm sitting, that looks an awful like a liquidated damages provision for a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.122" offset="13922333">And there's nothing wrong with a liquidated damages provision, but this Court has squarely held that that's legal relief when it's for a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.202" offset="13958590">It's prohibited by section 502(a)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.890" offset="13969353">And that brings me to my final point, which is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.656" offset="13980429">Just because the source of the claim is the contract doesn't mean that there can never be an equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.604" offset="14000177">We never take this position, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.792" offset="14008955">But what it does mean is that the plaintiff has to fit within one of the narrow exceptions at equity for an equitable remedy if they're seeking money for a violation of a plan term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.306" offset="14059005">And I'll close by saying that this theory of lien by assignment is very dangerous because it is not restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.720" offset="14088680">It does not require tracing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.564" offset="14096099">Plans could write terms in that say, if you breach this provision of the contract, we are entitled to specific funds out of any bank account that you may have in the bank at the time that you breach the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.549" offset="14139985">Under their theory of the Barnes line of cases, that would be equitable lien by assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.925" offset="14161510">That clearly bars legal relief.</text>
