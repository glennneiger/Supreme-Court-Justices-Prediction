            <text syncTime="19.755" offset="214879">The issue in this case is whether the Confrontation Clause permits the prosecution to substitute hearsay for the live testimony of a child witness, absent a showing that the child is unavailable to testify at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.843" offset="271199">The issue arose in this case at the defendant's trial on the charges of sexual assault and other related offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.639" offset="306412">The alleged, victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.261" offset="312891">S.G., who was 5 years old at the time of trial, did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.993" offset="331803">Instead, the prosecution relied upon hearsay testimony that merely related S.G.'s unsworn, out-of-court accusations against the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.710" offset="374644">Based on this evidence, the jury found the defendant guilty of the offense as charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.941" offset="395647">The Illinois appellate court affirmed the defendant's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.475" offset="409753">The Illinois supreme court denied the appeal and this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.449" offset="433681">This case presents conflicting considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.423" offset="449563">On the one hand, it is the defendant's constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.218" offset="476731">The defendant's convictions were premised on the out-of-court accusations of a single witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.641" offset="498360">Because the child did not testify, the defendant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine his only accuser.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>

            <text syncTime="107.021" offset="563875">One was considered, one set was a spontaneous declaration, and the other was statements made by while submitting yourself for a medical examination?</text>

            <text syncTime="116.937" offset="603581">That's right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.279" offset="608910">On the other hand, it's the State's interest in the welfare of the child witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.404" offset="641407">It is a difficult experience for a child to testify in a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.735" offset="658752">Of course, the same can be said for the elderly, the mentally impaired, victims of sex crimes, victims of violent crimes, and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.783" offset="698981">However, since our adversary system expresses a strong preference for confrontation at trial, this Court has held that competing interests must be closely examined, and any exception to the confrontation right must be narrowly construed.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.254" offset="944845">The defendant moved for a mistrial based upon the fact that the child did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.347" offset="969191">The waiver argument was presented to the Illinois appellate court and the Illinois appellate court found it necessary to reach the constitutional issue in what, I must say, is a very forceful opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.393" offset="1013390">That constitutional opinion is now the law in the State of Illinois, and it's persuasive authority in other jurisdictions as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.881" offset="1047349">And I submit, it is the constitutional issue that is now presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.583" offset="1066158">It must be remembered that the State is the proponent of the hearsay evidence in this case, and the burden is on the proponent of that evidence to establish the proper predicate for its introduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.718" offset="1150690">The State apparently made some sort of an attempt to get the child on the stand, and the briefs simply refer to the child as failing to take the stand, and I am not sure why.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.294" offset="1193008">I can guess, but I don't know why.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.079" offset="1280153">What we suggest the State should have done is to prior to introducing this evidence, requested a hearing and presented evidence on the issue of unavailability so the trial court could make a finding, at which point the record would clearly show one way or the other if the child was available to testify or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1079.964" offset="4455702">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.007" offset="4475869">The State of Illinois submits this morning that the Court's reasoning in United States v. Inadi applies to this case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.822" offset="4503141">The petitioner proposes that the rule of necessity laid out by the court in Maryland v. Craig is applicable to this case, and we submit that its reliance on Craig is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.480" offset="4549743">Craig involved a procedure used by the State which was intended solely to replace in-court testimony, so as to avoid live, face-to-face confrontation with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.448" offset="4597599">And it makes sense that a rule of necessity would apply in a situation like that, and the Court has in fact held that a rule of necessity does apply to hearsay which is intended solely to replace live, in-court testimony and specifically that is former testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.769" offset="4666876">But most admissible hearsay is not simply a substitute for live testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.734" offset="4686729">It has independent probative value which is derived from the circumstances under which is it made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.896" offset="4707418">For example, let's look first at spontaneous declarations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.009" offset="4723823">Because of their immediacy and the stress the declarant is under after experiencing a startling event, the statements are such that they are irreplaceable as probative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.998" offset="4771784">The value of that evidence cannot be duplicated on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.751" offset="4786830">With respect to statements made for purposes of medical treatment or diagnosis, a person speaks differently when consulting a doctor for treatment or diagnostic purposes than when testifying on the stand, and those statements also are irreplaceable as substantive evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.590" offset="6598161">Now if that's the case and these hearsay statements are going to come in, what would be the purpose of a blanket rule requiring the State to produce the declarant each and every time it wants to admit a hearsay statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.570" offset="6666079">As the Court noted in Inadi, such a rule wouldn't actually work to keep any evidence out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.495" offset="6693769">The statement will come in if the declarant is shown to be unavailable or it will also come in if he is available and produced for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.190" offset="6732639">The Court also noticed... noted in Inadi that such a rule wouldn't enhance the rule-seeking process over and above what exists without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.977" offset="6771718">If the prosecution doesn't call a declarant, and for all practical purposes I want to make it clear that the prosecution will by and large call a complaining witness or an eyewitness to help prove its case, but there are going to be certain circumstances where the State may feel that the witness would not be exceptionally effective, or in the case of small children, possibly the prosecutor would want to keep the child from being put in a traumatic situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.021" offset="6907869">And if that is the case, but the defendant still feels that he needs to call this witness, he can certainly do so under the Compulsory Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.295" offset="6944963">But the State submits that these cases where the State does decide not to call a complaining witness or a victim as in this case, and the defendant does feel that the testimony will be of some value to him, those cases are so small, so small in number that it doesn't justify changing the law as it now stands to require the State to produce the declarant with these particular types of statements each and every time it decides to enter one of these statements into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.846" offset="7127193">Finally, I would like to make one last point, and that is the effect that such an unavailability rule would have on the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.584" offset="7170138">The effect on the courts up to this time has been minimal because the necessity rule has only applied to cases involving prior testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.170" offset="8312525">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.536" offset="8349932">The Federal Government's submission in essence is that this case is indistinguishable in every meaningful sense from Inadi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.003" offset="8387862">Inadi makes clear that the rule of necessity that the Court had outlined in Ohio v. Roberts is reserved for the situation in which the Government attempts to admit hearsay which is essentially a less-desirable substitute for live testimony, and that rationale is just as inapplicable to the statements before the Court today as it was to the coconspirator statements involved in Inadi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.260" offset="8496845">The decisive feature of the statements involved in Inadi, the Court said, was that they were made in a context very different from trial which gave them special evidentiary significance, and the same can fairly be said of the two hearsay exceptions before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.142" offset="8564450">State and Federal rules of evidence firstly provide for the admission of excited utterances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.586" offset="8594229">After many years of experience with those sorts of statements, a consensus has emerged that statements made while a person remains under the emotional influence of a startling event have special reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.566" offset="8654102">Those statements are made at a point when the person's memory is as clear as it will ever be, and before there has been an opportunity for conscious revision or external influence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2141.633" offset="8702376">Well, Mr. Nightingale, what about the statement that was made 45 minutes later to the policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.377" offset="8725364">Suppose it had been 3 days later or whatever scenario you might imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.719" offset="8742709">At some point, I guess, one could say that perhaps excited utterance exceptions shouldn't cover it, but that is a matter of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.677" offset="8790566">How do you deal with that in the context of the Confrontation Clause challenge?</text>

            <text syncTime="2168.943" offset="8811568">At some point, certainly, a State court finding that a statement was an excited utterance would take it so far beyond the accepted core definition of that hearsay exception that it could no longer be regarded as firmly-rooted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.244" offset="8888786">The Court has dealt with similar situations, for instance, in Dutton v. Evans where a State was admitting coconspirator statements that were not in furtherance of the conspiracy, but rather during the so-called concealment phase of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.664" offset="8946465">There was also, actually the name of the case escapes me right now, but the point is that if a State application of a hearsay exception takes it outside the accepted firmly-rooted definition, then the Court could appropriately consider the particular application.</text>

            <text syncTime="2661.853" offset="10783291">I would like to respond again to the suggestion that the child was not a witness against the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.213" offset="10840656">Under the Solicitor General's approach, someone is a witness against the accused if they give testimony or they give statements in contemplation of litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2700.320" offset="10937100">At that time the police officer was aware than an allegation of a crime had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.084" offset="10964163">The child at this point was no longer excited, and the police officer testified that she was calm.</text>

            <text syncTime="2717.240" offset="11004809">I would suggest that these statements fit the definition of being made in contemplation of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.175" offset="11036574">In addition, last year in Idaho v. Wright, this Court applied Confrontation Clause analysis to almost the exact situation we have here, statements by a child to an examining physician.</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.399" offset="11189443">I would agree with that, and under that approach, I would suppose that a child would never be considered a witness against the accused, as children... most of their statements, I would suggest, may never contemplate that they will be made in contemplation of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.879" offset="11251301">And I would also note, and in this case the doctor who interviewed the child testified that he took notes in contemplation of litigation, that is at volume 6, page 63 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.348" offset="11301247">There has also been much discussion about the inherent reliability of the statements admitted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.354" offset="11329250">As I mentioned before, the statements to the police officer which were admitted under the spontaneous utterance exception, the basis for that is the child is excited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.720" offset="11370732">As I mentioned before, the child was no longer excited at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.693" offset="11386615">The police officer said she was calm and certainly the statements were not spontaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.905" offset="11407408">They were made after she had talked to two others, and in response to leading questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.399" offset="11429456">Also, the statements to the nurse and the doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.781" offset="11442935">Under similar circumstances in Idaho v. Wright, this Court held that statements such as these were unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.147" offset="11476372">The basis for that exception relates to the details relating to medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.414" offset="11513465">However, in this case the appellate court made a broad interpretation that allowed the details of the alleged offense, and under these circumstances, I would suggest that the statements in this case do not fit the historical hearsay rationale.</text>
