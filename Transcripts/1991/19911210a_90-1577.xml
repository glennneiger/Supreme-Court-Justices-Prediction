            <text syncTime="341.436" offset="1505265">Let me continue just... and briefly summarize the facts and procedural posture, because both are very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.506" offset="1525536">Shortly after midnight on the evening of November 5, 1989, LeTesha Mountain was killed when the automobile in which she was driving was hit from the rear by a stolen automobile, driven by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.397" offset="1577154">The district court, after a hearing at which respondent was represented by counsel, concluded that his conduct amounted to involuntary manslaughter and that respondent was a juvenile delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.340" offset="1628876">There followed a commitment hearing at which the district court considered a variety of matters such as respondent's drinking problem, the possibility of his rehabilitation, and the juvenile facilities available for detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.965" offset="1675374">After that hearing, the district court sentenced respondent to 36 months' confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.017" offset="1695645">On appeal, the Eighth Circuit vacated the sentence and remanded it for resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.820" offset="1710796">The court acknowledged that the sentencing guidelines did not apply to juvenile delinquency adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.224" offset="1732425">The court nonetheless ruled that using the sentencing guidelines to define the maximum sentence that could be imposed on the juvenile under section 5037 would eliminate any unwarranted disparities that could arise between the sentencing of juveniles and adults in the Federal courts today.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.202" offset="1808390">The Eighth Circuit believes that the legislative history of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 made clear that Congress didn't intend for such disparities to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.375" offset="1845065">Finally, the Eighth Circuit also relied on the Rule of Lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.994" offset="1859485">Now, we believe that the Eighth Circuit misread the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.111" offset="1872024">In our view, the pivotal part of the statute, the phrase dealing with the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile were tried and convicted as an adult, refers to the statutory maximum term and not to the maximum sentence that would have been imposed under the sentencing guidelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.830" offset="3742809">They're assuming that Congress wanted uniformity across the board to include juveniles, and it's our view that Congress did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.983" offset="3771439">Congress, for example, in section 995, subsection (a)(19) of title 28, which deals with the powers of the Sentencing Commission, said that the Sentencing Commission has the power by a majority vote to... to study the feasibility of developing a guideline sentencing system for juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.945" offset="3843328">That is not simply one indication that the sentencing guidelines don't apply to juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.063" offset="3859733">It also represents the fact that Congress was asking the Sentencing Commission for guidance in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.051" offset="3879691">After all, you had a discretionary sentencing system before for juveniles and for adults, and Congress saw that there were terrible problems that had arisen in the adult criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.209" offset="3928383">It decided that a sentencing guidelines mechanism was the way of reducing those disparities, and it directed the Commission to adopt a sentencing guidelines system to eliminate those disparities.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.064" offset="3971746">But this section I've just cited to you, which is excerpted in footnote 1 in our opening brief at pages 10 to 11, is strong proof that Congress didn't believe that it needed at that time to address the problems of the juvenile justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.342" offset="4032873">That's one of the reasons that Congress is... indicated that juvenile justice system sentencing mechanisms with only one minor modification should remain as they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.198" offset="4068295">The minor modification is a second reason why the guidelines don't apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1024.275" offset="4236628">It's a quite different issue... whether the maximum of the guidelines will be the maximum for a sentencing of a juvenile, and that's quite different.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.415" offset="4289186">First, as I've tried to summarize, what it does indicate is that Congress left alone the juvenile sentencing mechanisms so that it could address that at a future date if Congress desired to, perhaps after the Sentencing Commission has come forward with a study showing that it is... is or is not feasible to have a guideline sentencing system just for juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.865" offset="4374972">After all, there are caps that apply to the juvenile sentences that can be imposed that don't apply in the case of adults, so you have at least half of the possible sentences that could be imposed under the sentencing guidelines, or more than half, that don't apply in the case of a juvenile.</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.893" offset="4455116">--Right, but the point is, if you're setting up a guideline system and you say we're not going to apply this system, this new system to the juvenile justice system because we want somebody to study it, that indicates you're looking at the juvenile justice system as something that you may address later, and that's what they decided here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.907" offset="4527110">It's not necessary, or any logical implication from that, that it means we want the statutory maximum sentence from the guidelines automatically to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.744" offset="4558456">I mean, after all, the purpose of a guidelines is to have not simply a maximum but a minimum, and it would be odd for Congress, knowing that the Commission--</text>

            <text syncTime="1427.884" offset="5851100">The reality is that if an adult had been sentenced for the crime of involuntary manslaughter the sentencing court would have had no choice but to determine what the applicable sentencing guidelines would be.</text>

L. C. had been tried and convicted as an adult in this case, the maximum term of imprisonment authorized would have been 21 months.</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.187" offset="9168233">Doing that, you would say well, the sentence in (a) in effect was saying look, we're not importing every possible policy statement that might be applicable in adult circumstances, but you should at least winnow through them and winnow out the ones that would be pertinent to a juvenile proceeding and consider them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.582" offset="9245869">So that that would be consistent both with the theory that they were not subjecting juvenile sentencing to the guidelines across the board, or indeed to the guideline philosophy across the board, but they were doing so if the sentencing court could figure out on a selective basis what might be applicable in a juvenile case and tell them to consider that, and of course ultimately, on your theory, be subject to the cap of the highest possible adult sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2309.387" offset="9377108">I haven't seen anything in the legislative history or in any other documentation that indicates exactly what their intent was, but I think that all those are possible interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.034" offset="9459655">The Government argues that sentencing guidelines... essentially the sentencing guidelines cannot authorize a sentence, and I think that... or it appears, based on the Court's decision in Mistretta, that the sentencing guidelines do authorize a sentence, because this Court recognized in Mistretta that there was a delegation of authority to the Sentencing Commission, a broad delegation of authority, and that the authority that was delegated was the authority to formulate binding sentencing guidelines, and that there would be determinate ranges, that the guidelines would be mandatory... a judge would have no choice but to impose them... and that if the judge did not impose them there was a provision written right into the act that it would be reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.514" offset="9641572">So clearly the practical and legal effects of the guidelines are that they create an enforceable provision and they set limits that are below the statutory limits, and I believe the Government's interpretation of the word authorized and the fact that the sentencing guidelines are not authorized fails to take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.117" offset="9759959">Our position is and has been since the beginning that this statute is not ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.021" offset="9787648">Clearly, they could have said what the Government reads the statute to have said, but it doesn't say that, and maybe one of the most important things is that at one time it did make a reference to statutory maximum, and that reference was deleted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.566" offset="9853790">And I think it's important to know that that reference was deleted before this statute ever became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.005" offset="9887541">So the statute, whereas it may have once referred to the statutory maximum, it never referred to the statutory maximum when it became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.075" offset="9919828">At the time it became effective, that language was gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.931" offset="9955250">We do not believe this is an ambiguous statute, but if the Court determines that it is an ambiguous statute, I think that the Court must apply the Rule of Lenity as did the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, because in this case to not apply the Rule of Lenity would place the respondent in a position where essentially he would be punished because this Court has to guess... albeit an educated guess, but would have to guess as to what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.050" offset="10067681">And the Rule of Lenity has long established that if the Court has to guess, then it should guess in favor of the person, the individual, and it should guess in favor of the shorter sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.944" offset="10231312">I think this case, Your Honor, is not that inconsiscent with the Chapman case, because in the Chapman case where the Court did not apply the Rule of Lenity, the Court said that when Congress wants to say something, they know how to say it, and if they don't say it, then we can assume that they didn't mean it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.656" offset="10302156">And I think that that's analogous with our case, because Congress clearly knew how to say it if they meant statutory maximum, and as I indicated earlier they did say it at one point, but they deleted it.</text>
