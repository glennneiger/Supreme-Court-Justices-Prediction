            <text syncTime="14.870" offset="210927">Mr. Feldman.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="16.122" stopTime="172.955">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="16.122" offset="215942">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.126" offset="243945">This, a case... this case arises from a suit by the State of Ohio against the United States Department of Energy, concerning the operation of DOE's Fernald, Ohio uranium processing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.174" offset="296086">Now, all aspects of the case have been settled, other than the State's claim for State and Federal civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.220" offset="320328">Thus, as the case comes to this Court, the issue before the Court is solely whether civil penalties are available against the Federal Government under four specific provisions of the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, RCRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.320" offset="376752">Now it's our position that the provisions are most reasonably interpreted not to waive sovereign immunity as to civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.923" offset="403083">But the issue in the case is not whether we can show that those provisions mean what they say they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.347" offset="424817">The issue is, because this involves a waiver of sovereign immunity, whether the State can show that Congress clearly and unambiguously, in the language of these statutes, waived sovereign immunity from civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.253" offset="468390">Now that, that is based on the well-settled rule that it is up to the State to prove... to show that a waiver exists, that any doubts concerning whether there's a waiver should be resolved against finding a waiver of sovereign immunity, and that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.294" offset="536621">Congress was well aware of those principles at the time when the provisions at issue here were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.687" offset="558146">Indeed, the key provisions, which are the Federal facilities provisions of the Clean Water Act and of RCRA, were enacted within a year or so after this Court's decisions in Hancock against Train and EPA against California, which specifically rested on the clear statement principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.638" offset="621990">Indeed, Congress must have been aware of that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.761" offset="634424">And I think if we... if you look at the language of the statutes at issue, it's impossible to find a clear and unambiguous waiver under those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.006" offset="667443">Now, if there were still any doubt, there are two features of the case that suggest that that clear statement rule has to be applied with particular rigor.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.422" offset="697118">First, there's the long-settled understanding that where an asserted waiver of sovereign immunity would upset the delicate Federal-State balance, and in particular, where it subjects the Federal Government to regulation by States, it's particularly appropriate to apply the clear statement rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.030" offset="759498">And that is... that would be the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.872" offset="766917">Secondly, where an asserted waiver of sovereign immunity would have an effect on the Federal... and perhaps more important where an asserted waiver of sovereign immunity is penal in nature, the Court has also applied the clear statement rule with particular rigor.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.214" offset="828252">Perhaps the case that's most closely on point is Missouri Pacific Railroad--</text>

            <text syncTime="172.955" offset="843194">May I interrupt you, Mr. Feldman, because there is one sentence in the statute that does seem rather clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.980" offset="863361">It says... just the second half of it on page 58 of your opinion... the United States shall be liable only for those civil penalties arising under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.144" offset="904008">Now, in any case, it must arise under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.066" offset="915710">But can you not... can that any way possibly be interpreted to say there's no case in the world in which the United States shall be liable for a civil penalty?</text>

            <text syncTime="218.996" offset="1027410">But that language itself is not the language of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.977" offset="1039322">It's a language of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.157" offset="1044024">So we would submit that that language itself doesn't waive sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.030" offset="1059488">And if you look at the earlier language, earlier in the same provision... I might refer you to page 1(a) of the appendix of our brief where it's reprinted... there are three categories of items as to which sovereign immunity is waived.</text>

            <text syncTime="1274.431" offset="5249111">And that's reinforced by the following provision which lists each of those three things, A, B, C.</text>

            <text syncTime="2129.655" offset="8670003">In other words, DOE loses the use of the money it has strived so carefully to get from Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2233.433" offset="9085141">Because the fact that they've paid this penalty calls Congress' attention, including in the appropriation process, where they might have to re-fund the money drawn by that penalty, or re-fund the money drawn from the judgment fund, that very definitely calls attention to the public agency... to the Federal agency by the public and by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.128" offset="9175942">In fact, Your Honor, we have had cases where Federal agencies have been willing to pay us money simply if they don't call it a civil penalty, because of the embarrassment factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.494" offset="9221395">And, in fact, Your Honor, we also have to go back to can Congress's statements about civil penalties in the 1972 Clean Water Act, where Congress acknowledged that although injunctive relief was available, the Act was not working in part because there were no penalties for noncompliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.858" offset="9294852">And in light of that overriding purpose from Congress, even Congress realized that injunctive relief alone was not adequate to do the job.</text>

            <text syncTime="2562.908" offset="10403070">--The... the sentence that we've been describing, I think, can be, can be explained as to its intent by looking at the... how the State programs, the State civil penalty programs work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.053" offset="10495648">We've developed in our brief that State law programs operate in lieu of and on behalf of the Federal Government with respect to the civil penalties that are assessed under those programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.832" offset="10554790">Notably, the United States EPA refers to enforcement mechanisms such as civil penalties as the requirements of State programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.450" offset="10601183">But it does not refer to State contempt sanctions as part of that program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.834" offset="10626783">So that is why it was necessary in the second part of that sentence to separately refer to the State and local court contempt sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.902" offset="10670982">One thing that has to be emphasized with respect to the State law programs is that EPA has basically been told to keep its hands off of enforcement, as long as the State is implementing its approved program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.404" offset="10753007">Now, in fact, USEPA has to give 30 days notice before the State, and allow the State to enforce... take advantage of the situation and try to enforce first, before the Federal Government can even act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.105" offset="10815805">And the Congress has made it very clear that USEPA's enforcement actions to get civil penalties and other enforcement are to be the unusual exception; that the States are primarily entrusted with the function of enforcing this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.367" offset="10888843">Therefore, it doesn't make much sense to try to limit the statement made in this section to only those civil penalties that have been assessed pursuant to the citizens suit provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.999" offset="10951433">There will be very little enforcement at all if that occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.181" offset="10972122">And, in fact, if the State does not enforce, that is grounds for USEPA to revoke its program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.398" offset="11009007">So the option is not even left open for the State to allow EPA to take all the enforcement against the many Federal facilities that exist in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3096.147" offset="12536021">And, in fact, that's one more reason why we believe that they do arise under Federal law, is because they are part of a program which USEPA has labelled requirements of the State enforcement programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.605" offset="12581892">And they are approved as part of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.526" offset="12589519">And they operate in lieu of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.937" offset="12599132">And as I mentioned before, given the fact that USEPA is not supposed to be enforcing the statute unless the State falls down, it is much more likely that the Federal Government wanted the State to take the lead against the Federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.017" offset="12663498">I would like to just briefly and quickly distinguish the 1331 case law, although as I mentioned before, we do not rely on this case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.835" offset="12714803">We believe that 1331 arising under case law should not be used to interpret arising under in the Clean Water Act because of the different purposes of those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.183" offset="12756181">However, under the Machinists case, the Department of Energy has made the argument that it is State law that... in our case it is State law that is providing the penalties, and therefore, even under 1331 it can't arise under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.774" offset="12826502">Well, Machinists tells us differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.114" offset="12835906">Because in that case, it was a private contract, implementing the purposes of Federal law that was deemed to be arising under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.182" offset="12876135">So the fact that the penalty actually is passed as a State law, does not... even under Federal question jurisdiction... detract from the fact that it arises under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.452" offset="12933186">Just one quick point about the administrator being sued under the Clean Water Act citizens suit provisions that I'd like to respond to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.378" offset="12984909">The administrator can be sued under that section if, for example, an EPA building would pollute the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.454" offset="13013225">And it does make sense in the light of the fact that EPA, indeed, can be a Federal agency violating the law just like any other agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.181" offset="13044154">EPA has to obey the law as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.492" offset="13053350">With respect to the Ault case, we believe that the case is dramatically different than the one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.377" offset="13092951">Although the waiver in the statutory text was extremely broad in that case, the statutory text allowed the President to pass an order... enact an order which limited the scope of that general waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.737" offset="13154391">And that's exactly what happened in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.562" offset="13181663">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.524" offset="13193470">I'd just like to make two points, one specific, and one more general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.745" offset="13210398">The specific point is, as to the arising under Federal law clause that I discussed earlier, I think it should be kept in mind that that provision was added by a conference committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.174" offset="13252089">It wasn't in either the Senate or House versions of the bill when it was first enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.567" offset="13265673">The legislative history you can find in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.567" offset="13273719">There's no legislative history or no commentary on what that provision might have meant, or what the conferees thought it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.012" offset="13299423">And I think that that adds perhaps some plausibility to the view that they wanted to make sure that whatever else had already been done, or had already been waived in the statute, they wanted to be sure that in any event, they wanted to cancel it if it didn't arise under Federal law, or it would pose a State or a... order a process of a State or local court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.423" offset="13377163">I think the history kind of supports that inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.605" offset="13389807">The more general point I wanted to make was that the case really is about whether there is a clear and unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity in the statutes at issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.770" offset="13466502">I don't... I think in light of going running through these statutes, and seeing the difficulties of interpreting them, the best you could say is that it's ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.413" offset="13497118">Now, Congress, at this very... well, not this very moment, they're in recess... but they've recently enacted amendments to the RCRA provision that's also at issue in this suit that would clearly and unambiguously waive sovereign immunity from civil penalties.</text>
