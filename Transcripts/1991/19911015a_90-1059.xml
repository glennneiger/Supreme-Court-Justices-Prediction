            <text syncTime="75.411" offset="439691">First, there is the statutes that provide tort remedies for all victims of tort, which of course apply to crime victims as well, and second, it bears mentioning that New York has a law, as I would guess, most jurisdictions do that have laws like this, New York has a law providing for the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.166" offset="522760">Of course, there has never been any contention that the forfeiture provision would pertain to the proceeds of a book or other expressive work or to royalties for the authorship of a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.043" offset="570303">But other than that, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.226" offset="578975">Other than that there is only this statute selecting speech-related assets for special treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.708" offset="636863">The forfeiture statute provides for forfeiture to the State, but the point I wanted to make is that it never occurred to the legislators in New York that the forfeiture statute would pertain to the proceeds of a book contract, and therefore, any suggestion that these are somehow crime proceeds I think is simply not correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.584" offset="832468">Profits from illegal trading, assuming that they violated State laws as well as Federal laws, would be presumably within the forfeiture provisions of the New York statute, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.004" offset="878130">The statute has an extremely broad definition of the phrase criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.298" offset="919299">In fact, it uses the term person accused or convicted of a crime, and in addition to applying to persons who are accused of crime, it applies to persons convicted, whether of State crimes or of Federal crimes, but it goes beyond that to include in its application persons who are acquitted of crimes by reason of insanity, and it also applies to persons who are never charged with crime at all, but who are deemed by the Crime Victims Board to have admitted crimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.416" offset="1127756">The law has been interpreted by the State courts in New York to contain a special statute of limitations provision that starts the limitations period running anew for any crime victim who wishes to begin a proceeding, collect a judgment, and obtain access to the proceeds of the book, first of all, so the 20-year period would not be a barrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.459" offset="1211870">And second of all, the statute does apply not only to those who are convicted, but to those who are found to have admitted crimes in their book.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.205" offset="1238933">And in this case, in this case, Henry Hill, the criminal whose activities triggered the application by the Crime Board of the statute to Simon &amp; Schuster is somebody who was cooperating with Federal and State prosecutors, was in the witness protection program, and had been immunized rather than being charged with the various activities described in his book.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.940" offset="1325869">And he was found to be within the description of a convicted person because his book was deemed to contain admissions of crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.557" offset="1420327">But I think that is a likely interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.061" offset="1430358">The New York Court of Appeals has interpreted the statute as not being applicable to victimless crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.937" offset="1453869">And so it would seem not a great step for the statute to be interpreted as not applying to those crimes with victims where the victims have been fully compensated as well, but I really don't know.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.152" offset="5698662">If New York were interested in a very broad novel expansive definition of crime proceeds it should do it comprehensively and not single out speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.120" offset="5746518">What the New York Court of Appeals said in dealing with that issue is that it recognized that criminals in fact can profit in that way, but it... it... it said that that's not the point of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.667" offset="5788732">The point of the law is to seize the proceeds of speech, and it doesn't really explain why, and in effect what the New York Court of Appeals is saying is that the law is narrowly tailored to seize precisely the proceeds of this speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.419" offset="9031782">The second thing that is critical about this statute is that this statute extends the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.516" offset="9064174">So that we all know about the story that comes years after the criminal is released and after the statute of limitations has expired.</text>
