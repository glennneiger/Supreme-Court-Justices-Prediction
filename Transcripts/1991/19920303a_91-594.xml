            <text syncTime="13.511" offset="199113">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.383" offset="210607">The question presented in this case is whether the sue and be sued clause in the Red Cross charter gives jurisdiction to the Federal courts or, instead, merely confers on the Red Cross the capacity to sue and be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.004" offset="269017">The clause gives the Red Cross, quote, the power to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity, State or Federal, within the jurisdiction of the United States, end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.614" offset="315515">The phrase State or Federal, on which we rely, was added to the charter in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.197" offset="341846">From 1905 to 1947, the Red Cross had the same power to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity, but the Federal courts were neither excluded from nor specified in that grant of capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.337" offset="402346">There is no possible basis to doubt that the Red Cross had the capacity to sue and be sued in Federal court between 1905 and 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.133" offset="441530">Nevertheless, the First Circuit construed the 1947 amendment as merely conferring that very same capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.218" offset="473921">That, we submit, was the court's first error.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.432" offset="482803">But the case for giving a jurisdictional reading to the sue and be sued clause rests on much more than the fact that the First Circuit construed the 1947 amendment to be meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.699" offset="527838">It rests on two venerable decisions of this Court: Osborn v. Bank of the United States, and D'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.034" offset="561170">The Osborn decision, written by Chief Justice Marshall, has been regarded as a landmark decision of this Court for 168 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.799" offset="592204">The D'Oench decision, now 50 years old, is famous in its own right in the banking field.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.744" offset="616028">And it's especially important because it was decided just before the amendments to the Red Cross charter were drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.726" offset="635985">The Court in Osborn construed the sue and be sued clause in the charter of the Second Bank of the United States as a grant of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.821" offset="668272">In fact, the Court thought the point so clear that it said that the words could not be made plainer by explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.755" offset="692096">The Court recognized that some sue and be sued clauses will merely confer the capacity to sue and not jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="768.942" offset="3220854">If the Court thinks it necessary to look to the legislative history of the Red Cross charter, it will find further support for our position on the statutory question.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.604" offset="3467450">The difficulty that federally chartered entities sometimes encounter in invoking diversity jurisdiction is that, because they are not citizens of any State, they lack a basis for diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.952" offset="3520844">That's no true of the Red Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.842" offset="3528367">In the 1905 charter, the section now codified at 36 U.S.C. section 1, and again in the 1947 charter, the section codified at 36 U.S.C. section 1A, the Red Cross is stated to be a citizen of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.142" offset="3581657">In light of that, the cases that say Federal corporations can't sue in diversity have no bearing on the Red Cross, and never had any bearing on the Red Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.699" offset="3619796">Even if one were to suppose that something in the charter had res diversity jurisdiction, it would surely be sections 1 and 1A, no the sue and be sued clause in section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.578" offset="3663368">The First Circuit relied heavily on this Court's 1916 decision in the Bankers Trust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.200" offset="3689804">But in our view, it simply got that decision wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.713" offset="3699939">The sue and be sued clause at issue in that case made no reference to the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.947" offset="3720837">And it was not a serious candidate to be construed as a grant of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.989" offset="3732958">The court, quite naturally, said that Congres would have used altogether different words had it wished to confer jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="934.512" offset="3883110">We agree entirely with the Red Cross, that article 3 of the Constitution permits Congress to extend jurisdiction to cases of which the Red Cross is a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.649" offset="3919681">In article 3 section 2 there are two clauses of the Constitution that are relevant to cases of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.914" offset="3944654">One clause that says that the judicial power shall extend to all cases arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made under their authority; the second clause says that the jurisdiction... the judicial power shall extent to controversies to which the United States shall be a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.562" offset="4011319">In our view, this case involves a sufficient Federal issue that... it arises under Federal law, not just because this Court has said clearly in the past that it does, but as a matter of logic and sound constitutional interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.812" offset="4068266">First, as a matter of fact in this particular case, the Red Cross is likely to raise issues of Federal law in defense to the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.297" offset="4102225">We understand the Red Cross will contend that it is not subject to punitive damages because of its relation to the Federal Government, and also that it, in some cases, has resisted demands for jury trials because of its relation to the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1087.867" offset="4496465">It's important to realize that the Red Cross is powerfully affected with the Federal interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.427" offset="5146705">Accordingly, the ability of the Red Cross to incur any obligations necessarily raises some ingredient of Federal law in each and every case to which it's a party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1282.049" offset="5273242">And as you know from the opinion in Merrill Dow there's a variety of rules that this Court has articulated to limit the statutory, arising-under jurisdiction to a much narrower field of play than the constitutional arising-under jurisdiction... even though both clauses have the same meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.799" offset="5340220">This case, for example, would no satisfy the well-pleaded complaint rule this Court has articulated as a limitation on section 1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.504" offset="5371045">On the other hand, it's quite a different thing to say that Congres could not constitutionally extend the jurisdiction to cases involving the Red Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.233" offset="5413990">And so there are quite a number of cases involving the Red Cross to which section 1331 would not extend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.637" offset="5439590">I... the issue in this case in substance and effect is whether or not those cases can be brought into Federal Court under the separate grant of jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.616" offset="5563515">If the issue in this case were a neighborhood grocery store in the District of Columbia that, for some patronage reason, Congress cloaked with a Federal charter simply to get it into Federal court, and it had no significant relation to the Federal Government, and for which there was no reason for its having a Federal charter except to get into Federal court, I think this Court might step back and say well, we've said that any Federal charter will satisfy but that one does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.074" offset="5665288">And, in fact, the analysis in Osborn suggests such a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.857" offset="5680439">The last thing I would like to point out on this point is the criticisms to which Justice O'Connor refers are, for the most part, directed at this Court's interpretation of the statutory jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.114" offset="5725474">It is true that this Court repeatedly has criticized the notion that Congress would have wanted to extend with the general Federal question statute all of the permissible jurisdiction permitted by article 3 to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.233" offset="5782003">And Justice Frankfurter, in the Lincoln Mills case, and the Court in the Romero case, rightly, suggested that it would be unwise to believe that Congress, in a general statute, intended to commit every single piece of jurisdiction that the arising-under clause permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.423" offset="5842712">But that criticism is not directed at the notion that Congress constitutionally could take an entity that is an arm of the United States... to use this Court's phrase... and create Federal jurisdiction over cases to which it is a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.762" offset="5900076">If I could just, in brief, in closing... the real gist of our argument on the merits is that the 1947 statute was enacted in an historical context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.400" offset="5954620">Congress created the Red Cross in 1905.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.493" offset="5962979">They clearly, at that time, gave jurisdiction over cases to which it was a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.575" offset="5979384">They also clearly gave it capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.346" offset="5990460">When Congress, in 1925, passed the general statute that is now section 1349, it took away jurisdiction over cases to which the Red Cross was a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.972" offset="6024942">It did nothing to alter capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.146" offset="6033614">There is not a suggestion in the materials that the Red Cross did not have the capacity to sue in Federal courts in the period just before the 1947 charter amendment statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.099" offset="6365474">We would state the issue in this case a little differently from the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.032" offset="6389193">We believe the real issue here is whether Federal jurisdiction over ordinary tort actions with no Federal issue and no limit on the amount in controversy should be implied from doubtful and ambiguous language in the Red Cross charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.795" offset="6464217">Now, Red Cross claims that the sue and be sued clause in its charter is a grant of Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.182" offset="6501729">Sue and be sued clauses are generally construed as simply a grant of capacity to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.820" offset="6540285">They ordinarily appear in corporate charters, whether they be Federal or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.932" offset="6560765">They're not usually construed to be anything other than the capacity to litigate, unless there is some very clear and specific language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.758" offset="6604024">We would say that they... the courts have construed sue and be sued clauses as grants of Federal... of court jurisdiction, but usually it's only when there's very specific and clear language, and usually there's a reference to particular courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.905" offset="6700677">There's got to be some way that you distinguish the language which relates to capacity to litigate to the language which is a conferral of jurisdiction, especially if it's all mingled into one sentence, as this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.024" offset="6753131">And that's why the courts have ordinarily required some very specific language referring to particular courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.137" offset="6781552">There are a couple cases this Court has considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.192" offset="6801823">The first one was the Deveaux case in 1809, and later the Bankers Trust case in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.928" offset="6828782">The language is very general in those two cases, and this Court ruled in each of them the language was not specific enough to be a grant of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.252" offset="6866085">In the case of Osborn v. the Bank of the United States, which was handed down in 1824, there was... this Court did rule that there was a grant of Federal jurisdiction there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.025" offset="6941108">And this is the case that the Red Cross relies primarily on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.287" offset="6954170">But we would suggest that the language in the Osborn case, especially the bank charter, is quite distinguishable from the Red Cross charter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.534" offset="7127205">What was provided in that second bank charter was to sue and be sued in all State courts of competent jurisdiction, and in any circuit court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.805" offset="7188227">As I suggested... as I've said, we think those charters are markedly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.479" offset="7214976">The Red Cross charter simply provides sue and be sued in courts of law and equity, State or Federal, within the jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.218" offset="7277879">The Red Cross charter is general and unspecific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.752" offset="7296060">The bank charter is quite specific, and uses the language of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.997" offset="7321033">The bank charter, in our view, is carefully drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.079" offset="7337334">It allows each State to determine the jurisdiction of its own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.873" offset="7356560">And there is a recognition and there's deference paid to the State court system of each State... State courts of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.139" offset="7393549">However, as to Federal jurisdiction, it designates the circuit courts of the United States which, at that time, were the Federal courts of original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.049" offset="7453213">So this is quite a specific and carefully drafted charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.190" offset="7469827">And as I've said, I think if it's confined to the language in that charter, it's a good decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.467" offset="7498875">It shouldn't be expanded, as the Red Cross suggests, because I think it will make that decision almost meaningless.</text>

            <text syncTime="2388.290" offset="9698176">I think there are other Federal corporations... I can cite three... which have very similar charters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.872" offset="9720537">Neighborhood... excuse me... Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation has a very similar charter; Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has a very similar charter; and Securities Investor Protection Corporation has almost an identical charter... and all three of these corporations, sooner or later, will be seeking Federal jurisdiction if this case is decided in the favor of Red Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.444" offset="9850836">As I stated, the way this is drafted, there's no concern for the peculiarities of each... court system, the State and the Federal, one being... one having courts of general jurisdiction, the others having... the other having courts of limited jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.202" offset="9957833">And therefore, I think it's sound to construe this statute not as a grant of jurisdiction, but as a grant of capacity to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.479" offset="9999002">There's not enough specificity in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.151" offset="10009660">And it resembles strongly the charter in the Bankers Trust case, which this Court ruled was a... simply a grant of capacity to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.756" offset="10052083">Now in 1925, Congress, at the urging of three justices of this Court, legislatively overruled the Osborn case, insofar as it pertained to Federal corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.946" offset="10108821">At that time, it precluded Federal corporations from access to Federal courts unless they were owned or controlled by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.194" offset="10157827">Now, that was a very strong, and definite policy, which has been followed by this Court over the last 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.920" offset="10188756">And I would suggest that if Congress wants to make an exception, as it has with certain Federal corporations, it would have done so by very clear and specific language... such as the FDIC charter, and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.084" offset="10273392">Those charters are very specific, and I suggest if they were going to do so in this case, they would have used very specific language to create an exception to that general policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2603.020" offset="10557082">I... however, I... I'm getting to the D'Oench case, and I would like to discuss that for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.445" offset="10582787">And I think the D'Oench case is quite distinguishable from the Red Cross case, and, in fact, supports our position more than it does the Red Cross position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.290" offset="10622179">To be sure, there's a sue and be sued clause which is very similar... to sue and be sued in courts of law and equity, State or Federal... very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.038" offset="10661154">But just below that, in the same charter, it says that all civil actions against the corporation shall be deemed to arise under the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.866" offset="10712459">That's a grant of Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.546" offset="10719250">And Congress so stated in 1935, when it amended the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.820" offset="10748299">In its report, it indicated, in 1935, when it adopted the deemed to arise language, that the purpose was to grant Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.520" offset="10795110">Now, why was that later amendment required, if the earlier sue and be sued clause was a grant of Federal jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.713" offset="10823845">Finally, I would suggest that the legislative history of the 1947 amendment, the addition of the language State or Federal, is both ambiguous and confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.565" offset="10895316">Courts have read that recommendation 22... number 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.769" offset="10920080">Some have said oh, all they're trying to do is clarify capacity to litigate in Federal court where it otherwise exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.034" offset="10945157">Other courts... half of the courts below... have said no, that's a grant of Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.820" offset="10972325">Now, I think that's an indication right there that this is a very ambiguous piece of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.773" offset="10996148">I would also point out for the Court there is language in recommendation number 22 which seems more consistent with a grant of capacity to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.083" offset="11057379">They say we should clarify the capacity to litigate in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.249" offset="11098026">They use the word clarify, and then they go on to say make it clear that the Red Cross can sue in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.095" offset="11133448">And then further on they refer to power to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.958" offset="11148912">These... this is language of capacity to litigate rather than jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.024" offset="11169183">And like everything else relating to this ill-starred amendment, it's ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.859" offset="11204501">And I would suggest that the Senate hearing on this amendment was quite confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.191" offset="11229788">Senator George says, at one point, that the purpose of the amendment is to give the jurisdiction to the State and Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.228" offset="11269912">And then a few pages later he says, we're going to give the Red Cross the power to be sued in State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.805" offset="11312230">That, I think, is the real purpose of this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.618" offset="11327485">So, we don't really know what Senator George was driving at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.832" offset="11344413">You can't reconcile those two statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.223" offset="11353921">It's also significant that the House and Senate reports don't even refer to the jurisdictional point at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.471" offset="11394881">In conclusion... I'm sorry... I would just make one other point, and that's on the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.715" offset="11427900">That has been discussed here, and we did mention it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.168" offset="11449739">We believe that this case here is very similar to the case of Mesa v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.013" offset="11481085">In Mesa, you had a Federal officer who was sued in State court and attempted to remove the case to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.849" offset="11516403">This Court ruled that that was a pure... that 1441... 1442(a)(1) was a pure jurisdictional statute, that the officer tried to remove the case to Federal court under.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.808" offset="11576276">And... but they did infer into the statute a requirement that the Federal defense had to be alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.327" offset="11618385">Now, what I'm suggesting is that that case, which dealt with a Federal officer, is analogous to this case, where we have a Federal corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.744" offset="11664047">They're both Federal entities of one kind or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.047" offset="11673242">And why shouldn't the same law apply to one that applies to the other?</text>

            <text syncTime="2907.683" offset="11775747">I'm not suggesting that the constitutional interpretation is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.506" offset="11791107">But I am suggesting that the... maybe that law pertaining to Federal corporations is no longer viable law, as Justice Frankfurter said at one point, in one of his opinions... I think in the Tidewater case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.456" offset="11846904">Finally, I would just observe, as one of the members of this Court has said, nothing is so wasteful as litigation over where to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.107" offset="11913464">We have been litigating this case now for the last 2 years, and we've done little else but talk about jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.150" offset="11941676">And I'm sure that both the Red Cross and the respondents will be happy when this vexing issue is laid to rest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.213" offset="12629846">Only in the constitutional sense are we asking this Court to hold... as it held in Osborn, and has reaffirmed since... that cases like this arise under Federal law, that it is party-based jurisdiction that depends on the status of the party as a federally chartered entity, and if the Court thinks it relevant, a very important Federal instrumentality that will be raising Federal defenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3212.014" offset="12993053">That clause actually was omitted from the Solicitor General's brief, curiously enough, in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.936" offset="13008831">The Solicitor General certainly thought the sue and be sued clause was adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.198" offset="13021788">And our whole point is that Congress is entitled to make the same assumption that the Solicitor General of this Court made in 1942, that a sue and be sued clause, with the words State or Federal, is adequate to confer Federal jurisdiction.</text>
