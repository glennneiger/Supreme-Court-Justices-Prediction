            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90874">The opinion of the Court in No. 90-848, Hilton versus South Carolina Public Railways Commission will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="9.580" offset="129117">This is a case involving the Federal Employers' Liability Act, sometimes called FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.459" offset="152627">The statute was enacted to give protection under federal law to workers who are injured in the nation's railroad transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.458" offset="180631">This case presents a question that we have addressed before, whether the injured worker can sue under the Act if the railroad is owned and operated by a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.085" offset="215112">Hilton, who is the petitioner here, brought suit alleging that he sustained injuries while he was working for a railroad which was owned by a state entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.164" offset="243429">The state entity is the respondent, the South Carolina Public Railways Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.737" offset="261819">We granted certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina after it ruled that Hilton's State Court action must be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.880" offset="294316">As I have indicated, we face this general issue before.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.752" offset="305810">In Parden versus Terminal Railway, a case decided in 1964, we held that a railway worker could sue a state-owned railroad in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.261" offset="343844">In a later case, though, Welch versus the Texas Department of Highways which was decided in 1987, we overruled the part of the 1964 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.005" offset="382818">In Welch, we said that states have immunity from FELA suits when the action is commenced in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.209" offset="407687">Hilton brought this suit in the State Court and the question now before us is whether Parden overruled Welch on such broad grounds that the FELA suit against the state may not be maintained in a State Court either.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.421" offset="452513">Today, we hold that Parden is still good law as applied to FELA suits commenced in State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.647" offset="473411">There are strong considerations for adherence to stare decisis in this case and insufficient counter-veiling justifications for departure from that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.344" offset="508206">The issue today is one of statutory construction and Congress has accepted our Parden interpretation for almost 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.632" offset="537359">Many states have legislated relying on Parden and therefore, excluded railroad workers from their workman's compensation schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.339" offset="572154">To overrule Parden would require an extensive legislative response from these state and would dislodge the settled rights and expectations of both employees and employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.383" offset="608307">For all these reasons we decline to depart from our precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.746" offset="621787">We hold that FELA does create a cause of action against state on railroads and it is enforceable in State Court under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.072" offset="659090">The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.803" offset="674032">Justice Blackmun concurs in the judgment; Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Scalia joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.410" offset="700467">Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
