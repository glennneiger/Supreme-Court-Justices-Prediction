            <text syncTime="197.967" offset="936323">The problem, of course, with that is that notice of appeal is really what starts the time ticking for compiling of the record, and without having the record before them, the appellee who has to answer the brief within the prescribed time is at a serious disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.913" offset="1008107">I suppose the answer to that is the appellee can ask for an extension, but it seems to me a rule with very far-reaching consequences that you're arguing, although there are some equities in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="969.285" offset="4021593">It could have treated it as a notice of appeal and directed the party to then file a brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.124" offset="4068927">The court would always have the power under Rule 3(a) for noncompliance with the rules in its discretion to impose whatever sanction it wants, including dismissal of the appeal, but in this situation what the court did was adopt the rule that a brief may never be a notice of appeal and divested the court of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.398" offset="4134024">I would submit that there's no basis in the jurisprudence of the court or in this rule to single out any document and say that this one document will never do service as a notice of appeal, even though any other paper may do it, and that is the word that is used in the comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.424" offset="4194106">A paper that serves the function of notice vests jurisdiction, and that, I think, is the first issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1058.671" offset="4379157">Justice Kennedy, the reason we get this informal brief is because he filed an untimely notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.044" offset="4400577">There was notice in this case, but if we take it out of that context and just have a brief filed with nothing else having been done, I suspect that the court would not treat that as a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.946" offset="4436208">It might treat it as a notice of appeal and start the correct procedures, but it is not a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.084" offset="4460763">It is not filed pursuant to the orders of the court in the ordinary course, and my point is the court should not be guided by the title the litigant puts on the document any more than the court is guided by the title that litigants put on any other documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.753" offset="4507470">It's not a brief in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.361" offset="4513844">It may well be a notice of appeal, but it's not a brief, and I don't think it would trigger any of the other time requirements because the court would not even have the case docketed, and I think that's the real answer to that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.150" offset="4585002">Justice Stevens, I would say for lawyers that would be almost remarkable that that would be done, and they're not going to file a brief 40 days early to avoid filing a one-page document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.802" offset="4627634">In that sense, it comes up in an odd sequence of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.505" offset="4638501">It would be very... it's very likely that a pro se litigant might file a brief for appeal without having done anything else, and I think what a circuit would do with that is recognize they don't have the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.344" offset="4673818">If they're going to treat it as anything, it will be treated as a notice of appeal and it will be sent back to the district court, as with letters to judges, motions to proceed in forma pauperis, motions for bond, and all manner of other documents that this type situation has come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.963" offset="4728257">Again, I think the important thing here that makes this ruling unusual is that it is the first ruling to come from the courts excluding a document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.616" offset="4762948">That has not been done in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.256" offset="4769426">This is the first document that has been targeted that it may not be the equivalent of a notice of appeal, and that's the context we think that is determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.050" offset="4800669">There's nothing in the rules that say that, and the rule is very permissive in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.376" offset="4817910">The only other issue in the case is the judgment designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.500" offset="4830448">There's no dispute that his informal brief identifies the court he's appealing to and who the appellant is, and with the judgment designation, that is something that the Court, since Foman and later 1990 in Firstier, has made quite clear that mistakes in that judgment designation, in the absence of prejudice to the other side, are not going to be fatal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.258" offset="4905472">And in this case there can be no doubt that Dr. Barry, who briefed the issue before Smith did, knew exactly what issues were in the case, and it comes in stark relief, because there's no question also that the basis upon which Dr. Barry was dismissed from this case, Calvert v. Sharp, was overruled by this Court in West v. Atkins, and that his claim that he was not amenable to suit under 1983 because he was a private physician, cannot be sustained on appeal on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.686" offset="5011216">And I think in that regard, when looking at the judgment designation, all of the defendants knew what the issues were in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.025" offset="5044548">They had effective notice that the judgment was being appealed, and there is no reason that this case should not proceed to be decided on the merits, however it may come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.131" offset="5081015">If there are no further questions, that concludes my opening argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.864" offset="5111944">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.610" offset="5162935">Rule 3 provides that an appeal shall be taken by the timely filing of a notice of appeal within the time allowed by Rule 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.262" offset="5197521">The plain language of Rule 3 sets apart the step of timely filing a notice of appeal as a matter of unique significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.119" offset="5228972">According to the rule, the failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the appeal's validity and is ground for such action only as the court deems appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.722" offset="5287382">The implication, of course, is that the validity of an appeal hinges on the timely filing of a notice of appeal, and that that step is of such fundamental importance that the court does not have such discretion with regard to a failure to fulfill that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.028" offset="5352584">Further evidence in the plain language of the rules as to the significance of this step is the time limit for filing a notice of appeal which, unlike other provisions of the rules which may be suspended pursuant to Rule 2, may not be enlarged by the court, in accordance with Rule 26(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.067" offset="5424682">In Torres, this Court emphasized the jurisdictional nature of the requirement of Rule 3 and the consequent need for strict compliance with its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.408" offset="5462089">The 1979 amendment to Rule 3 recognized the practice which had existed of not allowing mere informality of form of a notice of appeal to cause the loss of a right to appeal, and on that basis it is true various documents have been allowed to substitute for a notice of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.488" offset="5586432">We submit that allowing a brief to serve as a notice of appeal would not be mere informality of form, but would be waiving a separate jurisdictional requirement altogether, and there is support in the rules for that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.795" offset="5643588">The rules are designed as an integrated set of rules, according to the Advisory Committee note to Rule 1.</text>

            <text syncTime="2633.334" offset="10677802">It's just a response to a batch of questions from the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.145" offset="10700999">They say it's all on a form... as I say, he took the initiative to fill it out and send it back, but I think they then go on to adopt Carter, which is a Fifth Circuit rule, that is a blanket rule that a brief may never do service as a notice of appeal, and that's what they premise their holding on and drop a footnote and say, because of our holding we have no occasion to determine whether this particular document meets the judgment designation requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.200" offset="10777276">So I think that the holding is clear a brief not do service, and I would submit respectfully that it not a defensible position, and that... because there's just nothing in the rules that would do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.446" offset="10818236">I would also again point out there's also no question in this case that this informal brief has neven been the brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.316" offset="10845717">When we were appointed to the case, this case went through classical, formal briefing under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure with briefs that looked like briefs, and the court used those briefs to decide whether this document was a valid notice of appeal and it was based on the conclusion that a brief, something labeled a brief, may not be a valid notice of appeal, that the case was dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2721.206" offset="11029306">Then on June 24th, I believe it was, they filed a brief saying well, West v. Atkins came down, Calvert no longer gets us out of the case, but he didn't appeal to us anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.639" offset="11070997">It was at that point, not, at that point, even identifying the fact that the notice of appeal was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.404" offset="11090014">It was on a totally different issue at that point... it was at that point that the circuit appointed us to represent Smith and brief the issue of whether or not the informal brief could serve as a valid notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.274" offset="11137557">We then went through the ordinary briefing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.288" offset="11145603">We had a briefing schedule, we filed our brief, they filed theirs, there was a reply brief, and a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.412" offset="11162112">So in this case itself this informal brief is not a brief at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.143" offset="11181025">That's never been the issue for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.440" offset="11186249">The only issue was, can we call it a notice of appeal?</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.135" offset="11269005">I just want to close briefly on the question of solicitude, and I think the one thing that my colleague omits is the fact that Mr. Smith is proceeding pro se in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.192" offset="11321250">He is also, as the record makes very clear, suffering from rather substantial psychological problems, and they are putting an onus on him that I submit is inappropriate under these rules... inappropriate under the spirit of these rules, and putting him to a task that he and many other people out there simply cannot meet, in a situation where there is absolutely no prejudice to them at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2866.537" offset="11610582">What he didn't understand was the operation of Rule 4(a)(4), which apparently to a certain extent was spurred on by instructions from the Fourth Circuit that he did have a valid appeal and that he should file his informal brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.080" offset="11656767">He did that.</text>
