          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_p_joy" startTime="20.913" stopTime="254.077">
            <label>Mr. Robert P. Joy</label>
            <text syncTime="20.913" offset="232425">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="24.548" offset="246949">This case comes to the Court on writ of certiorari from the First Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.916" offset="268474">The question presented is whether an employer may legitimately bar nonunion... nonemployee union organizers from trespassing on its private property to seek to organize its employees when reasonable alternative means of reaching them are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.794" offset="339945">This Court, in NLRB v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox, a unanimous opinion in 1956, held that an employer may, in those circumstances, preserve his private property rights and exclude the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.237" offset="397728">In this case, a divided panel of the First Circuit with a strong dissent endorsing a ruling of the National Labor Relations Board held to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.779" offset="439942">We submit, Your Honors, that the First Circuit should be reversed, and in so doing this Court should reaffirm its holding in NLRB v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.235" offset="485708">Petitioner submits these principal arguments where Lechmere v. The National Labor Relations Board should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.341" offset="518100">First, the First Circuit endorsed the board's decisional model enunciated in Jean Country, which rests upon an erroneous legal foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.548" offset="558955">By taking the threshold inquiry into whether reasonable alternative means of reaching employees through the usual channels of communication exist before trespass will be authorized and denoting that inquiry in the analysis to one of three factors of seemingly equal standing, the analytical regime fashioned by this Court in Babcock &amp; Wilcox is dismantled and the private property rights of the employer are substantially diminished and oftentimes destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.035" offset="696882">A second principal argument that we submit to the Court why the First Circuit should be reversed is that the First Circuit and the board, while paying lip service to the holding of Babcock &amp; Wilcox that so long as there are reasonable alternative means available to the union to reach the employees, no trespass should be authorized, nonetheless allowed the union's effectiveness in persuading employees as opposed to reaching employees to become a factor in judging whether trespass is warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.907" offset="828435">Third, the First Circuit endorsed the board's creation of an impermissibly low standard for establishing that the use of alternative communications methods is not reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.048" offset="872947">In Sears &amp; Roebuck v. San Diego Council of Carpenters, this Court stated that the burden of proving that trespass is necessary is a heavy one.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.170" offset="913489">In Lechmere, the First Circuit and the board, we submit, in addition to allowing unfounded inferences, conjecture, and partial facts to satisfy this heavy burden, has given strong indications that a new and impermissibly easy standard for unreasonableness of a communication method has emerged by describing accessibility to the work force in terms of whether a union can obtain the names and addresses of employees through an employer-furnished list or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.673" offset="1031458">Briefly, the facts in this case are as follows, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.875" offset="1048281">The petitioner Lechmere, a retailer, opened a store in Newington, Connecticut, employing 200 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.731" offset="1075657">It established a no-solicitation, no-access rule, and consistently and unfailingly enforced that rule by prohibiting all efforts at solicitation, including the Salvation Army bell-ringer during the holiday season, the Girl Scouts of America, Burger King, the American Automobile Association, and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.029" offset="1176908">--Your Honor, I would respond by saying that it's an indication of just how strongly this employer has asserted its private property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.385" offset="1210345">On June 16, 1987, the United Food and Commercial Workers began a campaign to organize the employees at Lechmere by first putting a full-page ad in the Hartford Courant newspaper, which is the largest newspaper in the area of daily circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.395" offset="1270322">The ad, by the way, was aimed directly at the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.781" offset="1287876">A copy of one is attached to the joint appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="648.599" offset="2743210">That's correct, the board so found, Your Honor, and I would submit to you that they applied an erroneous legal standard in defining what reasonable alternative means were.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.269" offset="2777901">We submit that what the board was saying and... and applying here was a standard under which the... the union must be effective, must have reasonable alternative means which are effective in persuading the employees, as opposed to effective in merely reaching them, and the Babcock command, the command that this Court gave in NLRB v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox in 1956 was that the available methods need only be effective in reaching employees, not persuading employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.359" offset="2914260">Indeed, Your Honor, the Court in Babcock denied enforcement of a board order, and the underlying board decision found that there were no reasonable alternative means of communication because the methods of communication in the board's Babcock case were not... were in... were not as effective as placing the employees... the union organizers, I should say, on the employer's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.259" offset="3021780">The Court, while stating that the trespass that was authorized in Babcock was minimal and not unreasonable, nonetheless rejected the board's interpretation of that rule of law and said that more effective means isn't the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.407" offset="3106417">The issue is whether or not reasonable alternative means are available by the usual methods of communication, and the Court cited as the usual methods of communication telephone calls, home visits, advertised meetings, and the like, and it appears in footnote 1, I believe, of the Babcock Supreme Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.236" offset="3181754">It... it also referred in Babcock not just to the usual methods of communication but the usual ways of imparting information.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.324" offset="3214041">In this case, the board and the First Circuit endorsing the board, I believe, has misunderstood that rule of law that was enunciated respecting reasonable alternative means.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.500" offset="3266809">It... indeed, in the board's own brief to this Court on page 11, it talks about the paraphrasing... or, I should say it paraphrased Babcock &amp; Wilcox by talking about the effectively engaging in organizational activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.375" offset="3318322">That connotes to me that the definition, the interpretation, is one where they are convinced that the effectiveness means effectiveness in persuading and not reaching.</text>

            <text syncTime="818.359" offset="3422185">And as Judge Torruella said in his dissent, in one clean swoop the board and the First Circuit have eliminated the very tools used by the entire advertising and political industry to reach its targeted audience, and without any evidence on the record in this case that the employees were not reached by these mass media attempts, the board summarily dismisses the very same method of communication that the union began its campaign with, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="874.028" offset="3644853">They also placed an expense component on it, and I submit to you that in this case the union certainly did not apparently consider that method of communication expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.836" offset="3688111">Indeed, as I said, it utilized that method six times.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.553" offset="3698978">Your Honor, I would like to speak to the first argument that I mentioned, and that is that by relying on the Jean Country test the... the Supreme... the First Circuit relied on a legal erroneous foundation which fails to follow the applicable law.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.333" offset="3774106">As I mentioned, this was a unanimous opinion by eight Justices in 1956, and it construed the act and fashioned the legal rule that governs nonemployees seeking to trespass on an employer's property as distinguished from employees, and that rule prohibited trespassing except where the target employees were inaccessible and beyond the reach of less intrusive nontrespassory means.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.834" offset="3884134">We... I submit to you, Your Honor, that the Babcock Court placed a sentinel at the boundary of the private property, and that sentinel was a threshold inquiry... prove to me you have no reasonable available other means before I must let you by onto my property.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.648" offset="3963337">By reducing that inquiry to a relative contest among three of coequal status, the board and the First Circuit endorsing the board has taken that sentinel off his post guarding the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.740" offset="4023733">I... perhaps, if I may mix my metaphors, a little historical context of this most recent test enunciated by the board is helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.029" offset="4064902">Two years prior to Jean Country... and by the way, Jean Country was decided in 1988... 2 years before that, in Fairmont Hotels, the board enunciated a test for access by nonemployees onto employers' private property, and in that test in Fairmont the board said, we're going to... going to balance the property rights on the one hand against the section 7 right on the other hand, and only if they are in equipoise will we then look to reasonable alternative available means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.281" offset="4181930">Jean Country came along 2 years later, and the board apparently recognized its error and resurrected the threshold inquiry in Babcock from its obscurity and brought it up to a factor to be considered equally with the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.475" offset="4246714">In essence, then, what the board did was it took the horse from behind the cart and put it into the cart, and that's what the First Circuit adopted by endorsing the board's order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.948" offset="4292585">Now, the... the Supreme Court decisions since Babcock have bolstered rather than diminished the vitality of the rule of law enunciated in Babcock.</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.479" offset="6574746">The issue in this case is whether the National Labor Relations Board has reasonably accommodated competing section 7 rights and property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.235" offset="6609751">The board found in this case that petitioner's denial of access to its parking lot for organizational handbilling violated section 8(a)(1) of the act, which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in their section 7 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.546" offset="6690939">The board's interpretation of this general language is a reasonable one, and it should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.450" offset="6714554">The petitioner's argument here today makes clear that its entire reliance is placed on the Babcock &amp; Wilcox decision and inferences that petitioner draws from that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.360" offset="6766172">But the board's rule that's under review today, however, is consistent with Babcock &amp; Wilcox.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.098" offset="6789160">First, the central principle of Babcock &amp; Wilcox is that the board must make an accommodation between private property rights and section 7 rights when the two conflict, and that accommodation must be obtained with as little destruction of one as is consistent with the maintenance of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.725" offset="6863661">I would suggest that that formulation itself implies that the board should consider weighing the impact on respective rights before reaching the appropriate accommodation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2972.146" offset="12037369">Justice Blackmun pointed out in his concurrence in that case, I believe, that the board's experience had been comparatively limited in applying Babcock, because for several years there had been First Amendment holdings of this Court that recognized shopping centers as essentially forums protected by the First Amendment, and the board had not gained as much experience in developing and applying the law, so what the Court did in Sears was look to the existing state of the law and summarize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.149" offset="12149382">I don't believe that it purported to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.916" offset="12156487">I certainly don't believe that it purported to overrule the statement in Hudgens, which was an access case, where the Court said that there are a spectrum of various accommodations that depend upon the character and strength of the property interest and the section 7 interest in any given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.110" offset="12225241">That is what the board is attempting to implement in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.412" offset="12238407">What the board is doing is not inconsistent with Babcock, because the board does look to reasonable alternatives in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.149" offset="12265365">Whether or not every decision is supported by substantial evidence is not a question that goes to the merits of the board's general approach, and the board's approach is fully consistent with the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.024" offset="12308833">I think on that basis it is entitled to be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.243" offset="12325760">The... the question of mass media was raised by petitioner as being a panacea, as a form of access in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.950" offset="12364631">I think the board's answer to that is a quite reasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.752" offset="12379782">If you're attempting to reach 200 employees who live in a fairly large metropolitan area, the expense and the unlikeliness that the newspapers will actually convey the organizational message is a powerful reason for rejecting mass media as an alternative in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.280" offset="12449894">Similarly, in this case the board looked at... at what the union had available for contacts with the employees at their homes through tracing license plates and concluded that that was not effective either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.123" offset="12509244">The reason is that the union attempted to trace license plates over several months, and it obtained less than a fifth of the names of petitioner's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.312" offset="12546025">That is not going to get the message about the union's existence and the programs that it supports to four-fifths of the work force, and I think the board was fully entitled to reject that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.286" offset="12909963">As I understand the board, the board is saying that that can be reasonably effective access to those employees in some cases, namely where the employer does not have a building open to the public, but that is not reasonably effective access to the employees in another case... 60 percent is good in one case and not good in the other.</text>
