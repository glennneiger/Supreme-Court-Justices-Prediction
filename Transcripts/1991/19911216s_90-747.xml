            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90863">I have the opinions of the Court to announce in two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.105" offset="107268">The first of them is United States Department of State versus Michael D. Ray.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.161" offset="131405">This case arises out of the respondent's Freedom of Information Act request for State Department documents containing information about Haitian nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.074" offset="175082">These nationals had attempted to immigrate illegally to the United States and were involuntary returned to Haiti.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.085" offset="203190">Respondents particularly sought to obtain reports of interviews in which officials from the United States embassy in Haiti inquired whether the immigrants had been harassed or prosecuted by the Haitian Government after they were involuntarily returned to that country.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.678" offset="269541">In response to this request, the State Department produced 25 documents but not before deleting the names and identifying information about individual returnees.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.776" offset="321890">The question presented to us is whether these deletions were authorized by Freedom of Information Act's Exemption 6 which provides that the Act's disclosure requirements do not apply to personal and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.738" offset="405795">For the reasons set forth in an opinion authored by Justice Stevens, we hold that the deletions were authorized because the disclosure of the unreducted interview reports would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the Haitian returnees' privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.864" offset="466295">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.048" offset="486984">Justice Scalia filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment which is joined by Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.650" offset="513420">Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
