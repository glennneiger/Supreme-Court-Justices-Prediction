            <text syncTime="10.996" offset="171122">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.543" offset="181362">James Stringer was convicted and sentenced to die in Hinds County, Mississippi for a killing during the commission of an attempted robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.866" offset="214694">The jury found three statutory aggravating circumstances, one of which was the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.191" offset="247922">The jury then found that statutory aggravating circumstances were not outweighed by mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.798" offset="278328">The Mississippi supreme court affirmed Mr. Stringer's conviction and sentence after a review of the aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.185" offset="307899">The court below, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, again affirmed Mr. Stringer's sentence, relying on what it perceived to be Mississippi's rule of automatic affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.712" offset="358054">That is, where there's at least one valid aggravating circumstance, despite the fact that the jury may have also relied on an invalid or unconstitutional aggravating-circumstance, the Mississippi supreme court would automatically affirm the sentence of death without individualized review.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.252" offset="432242">This Court vacated Mr. Stringer's sentence and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Clemons v. Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.779" offset="466305">The Fifth Circuit again affirmed the sentence, this time relying upon the nonretroactivity of Clemons v. Mississippi and Maynard v. Cartwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.478" offset="509146">Clemons and Maynard represent no new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.650" offset="521789">We rely on two fundamental principals central to this Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="105.036" offset="547285">Counsel, just at the outset, and you can just do it in the course of your oral argument, but it seems to me the briefs don't meet very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.174" offset="583856">Mississippi is arguing that even if Clemons was dictated by Godfrey as to the content of the aggravating factor, Mississippi wasn't the kind of State that Georgia was or that Florida was or that Oklahoma was.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.088" offset="659507">And that I didn't see addressed in your brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.556" offset="669434">So I hope during the course of your argument you'll make that clear what your position is.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth J. Rose</label>
            <text syncTime="139.789" offset="686361">Your Honor, I could go ahead and address that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.007" offset="695243">Mississippi has always contended that it is a State like Florida, that is, it requires a finding of at least one statutory aggravating circumstance, and then the jury is required to weigh statutory aggravating circumstances against all mitigating circumstances, and the jury is required to make a unanimous finding that statutory aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.340" offset="796493">Mississippi has compared itself to Florida and has relied upon Florida law in several cases; Coleman v. State, Evans v. State, Gilliard v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.414" offset="836826">The State contends that Mississippi is not like Florida, because it says that there is a narrowing done in Mississippi at the definition of capital murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.113" offset="883638">Our contention is even if that is true, even if Mississippi has defined capital murder in a way similar to Texas where it makes a subclass of persons that may have committed murders eligible for the sentencing phase, that is not... that does not solve the constitutional problem, because Mississippi then allows vague statutory aggravating circumstances to be relied upon by the sentencer, and puts emphasis on those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.223" offset="1020101">In order to be eligible for the death penalty in Mississippi, you have... the jury must make that unanimous finding that aggravating circumstances are not outweighed by mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.126" offset="1055732">So the fact that Mississippi has allowed a vague aggravating circumstance to be considered and relied upon by the jury is a constitutional violation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="242.248" stopTime="266.676">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="242.248" offset="1096170">But of course, the further question is whether or not that's a new rule under Teague.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.542" offset="1117381">And it seems to me that Mississippi makes an important point that it has to be... that you have to counter when it says that this simply was not anticipated as of the time of Clemons because of the differences in the States, in the two States' sentencing schemes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_j_rose" startTime="266.676" stopTime="379.037">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth J. Rose</label>
            <text syncTime="266.676" offset="1193868">Your Honor, Florida has narrowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.549" offset="1205362">And I think that's a... that may be a misconception that Mississippi has narrowing, Florida does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.859" offset="1230648">And then there's balancing in Mississippi and in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.389" offset="1240784">Florida has narrowing by the initial finding of an aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.169" offset="1259905">Mississippi has narrowing either by the definition of capital murder or by the initial finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.837" offset="1294492">But then they both require a weighing.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.165" offset="1303896">So they're similar in the respect that both have some initial narrowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.225" offset="1324062">But then they both require aggravating circumstances... statutory aggravating circumstances to play a central role.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.769" offset="1350289">And if... this Court has always held that if a statutory aggravating circumstance is vague, even if it's at that point where it's determining eligibility for the death sentence, where aggravating circumstances are weighed with mitigating circumstances, then there's constitutional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.137" offset="1423745">This Court held in Zant where there was an initial narrowing by an aggravating circumstance, a valid aggravating circumstance, that there still needed to be an individualized determination of the effect of an unconstitutional aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.849" offset="1490619">And this Court accepted Georgia's representation that the effect was inconsequential in Georgia because statutory aggravating circumstances played no special role under the Georgia... played no role under the Georgia scheme beyond the initial narrowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.467" offset="1553104">So the problem in Mississippi and the problem in Georgia that the Court discussed in Zant that was a cause of constitutional error in Zant was not that there was no narrowing at all; the problem was that there a consideration by the jury of a vague statutory aggravating circumstance that introduced an arbitrary and capricious factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.037" offset="1643383">Mr. Rose, I understand Mississippi says it relied on Zant.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.549" offset="1661355">Clemons has been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.034" offset="1667311">We know that Mississippi is a different situation from Georgia in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.968" offset="1691030">But so far as a new rule under Teague, I think you have to show that Mississippi was not entitled to rely on Zant, that, if you would, come as a surprise or whatever Teague said.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.400" offset="1748813">And to simply show that the two systems are somewhat different I don't think suffices.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.883" offset="1774727">I think... I think that first of all, Godfrey said that you cannot consider vague aggravating circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.082" offset="1803461">Yes, but that's your Maynard point, that's not your Clemons point, to go back to the Fifth Circuit's analysis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth J. Rose</label>
            <text syncTime="425.033" offset="1827285">Your Honor, our Clemons point is that there must be some individualized cure once the sentencer has considered a vague statutory aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.341" offset="1868558">And that has always been the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.215" offset="1876082">That was the case even in Georgia, where the statutory aggravating circumstance, the vague statutory aggravating circumstance played no role.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.384" offset="1904712">So our position is that Georgia required individualized review and this Court approved Georgia's application of its statute in part because it did require some individualized review.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.254" offset="1960196">You know, that probably shows your case is different from Zant, but I think you have to go further in Teague and show that Clemons was not a new rule.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_j_rose" startTime="468.157" stopTime="542.642">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth J. Rose</label>
            <text syncTime="468.157" offset="1999798">Yes, Your Honor, we do have to show Clemons is not a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.655" offset="2013799">And I think we can.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.575" offset="2017456">I think if you look at California v. Ramos as just an example, this Court said that there had to be some substantive... there are some substantive limitations on the factors that the sentencer can consider in determining whether death is the appropriate punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.256" offset="2092167">And it says what those substantive limitations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.599" offset="2101571">It says those limitations are consideration of vague factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.160" offset="2115781">That's apart from any consideration of the narrowing rule, the initial narrowing rule that every statute must provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.454" offset="2149009">In other words, there's a procedural requirement that every death penalty statute must be, and that is it must circumscribe the persons eligible for the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.451" offset="2184954">And then it may allow the sentencer to consider a myriad of factors in determining punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.011" offset="2207210">But one factor we know, and we've known it since Zant and we've known it since California v. Ramos, one factor it may not allow juries to consider are vague aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.460" offset="2249006">And the reason that is so is because it introduces an arbitrary and capricious factor into the sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.488" offset="2281084">We don't know what the juries considered when they considered vague aggravating circumstances--</text>

            <text syncTime="561.635" offset="2373767">Clemons had stated that there is some requirement of individualized review.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.678" offset="2401874">And in particular, it said a weighing State may allow the State appellate court to either reweigh or apply a harmless error analysis as long as there is some individualized review of the facts and circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.298" offset="2464359">That is not new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.312" offset="2468434">That has been in the rules since Eddings, Zant, and Barclay.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.233" offset="2484108">In Barclay, for example, this Court reviewed an invalid aggravating circumstance that was not constitutionally invalid, but was invalid as a matter of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.134" offset="2531755">This Court said in Barclay that the critical question was whether the invalid aggravating circumstance so infected the balance in process created by the Florida statute that it was constitutionally impermissible to allow the sentence to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.704" offset="2610018">Now that requires individualized review, because it looks at the statute, the Florida statute, the balancing process that has been established, and it requires the State appellate court to do some individualized consideration of the factors that were presented in the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.414" offset="2700820">There was more language in Barclay.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.648" offset="2709806">They talked about Barclay applying a harmless error test.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.146" offset="2723807">They considered the fact that there were no mitigating circumstances introduced in Barclay, and said that the court, the Florida court did do individualized review and said that was what was important.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.283" offset="2772291">The specific language in Barclay that supports our position that said what is required is some individualized review... some individualized consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.950" offset="2815027">The vast majority of State and Federal courts since Zant and Barclay have understood the required analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.087" offset="2851494">They've understood first you had to determine whether or not there were vague aggravating circumstances employed in the sentencing determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.879" offset="2882736">If there were, then the court had to do some determination, individualized determination of the effect of those aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.454" offset="2917009">That individualized consideration had to also include a consideration of the mitigating factors that were introduced in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.076" offset="2959536">Mississippi has done none of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.480" offset="2965074">And it stands alone in doing none of that until Clemons.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.355" offset="2980643">This Court's decisions on retroactivity during the last 3 or 4 years had one unifying theme, and that is similarly situated persons must be treated alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.256" offset="3036232">And for that reason it's particularly important that the two basic principles that James Stringer asked to be applied in his case have already been applied in a postconviction context.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.953" offset="3087014">In Parker v. Dugger, this Court applied in a postconviction context the principle that there must be some individualized review of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.980" offset="3123063">There was a question of whether there was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.527" offset="3133303">The State of Florida said yes, there is error under State law, and apparently did not apply an individualized review, either a harmless error test or a reweighing.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.537" offset="3177293">And this Court said that at a minimum some individualized review is required applying the principles in Clemons.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.050" offset="3207386">That is the same principle that James Stringer seeks to have applied in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.220" offset="3224105">It has already been applied in a postconviction context.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.781" offset="3238315">Secondly, in Lewis v. Jeffers, this Court applied the basic principal that James Stringer seeks to have applied in this case... in his case, and that is you cannot use a vague statutory aggravating circumstance in determining sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.182" offset="3299964">Now, the question again in Lewis v. Jeffers was on the periphery.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.054" offset="3323370">Well, had Arizona developed a case law that has narrowed the construction of its equivalent of the especially heinous, atrocious or cruel aggravating circumstance in such a manner that it was not applied in a vague way.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.314" offset="3376451">And the Court answered that question yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.719" offset="3386064">But the basic principle that you cannot use vague statutory aggravating circumstances was accepted and there was no debate that that principle should be applied in Lewis v. Jeffers.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.387" offset="3432771">In conclusion, this Court was right to apply on habeas review the long-established principles that were the premise for Cartwright and Clemons, including that the sentencer cannot rely upon vague statutory aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.239" offset="3500167">And if the sentencer does rely on such circumstances, there must be some type of individualized review by the State appellate court to cure the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.595" offset="3537574">That was a law... that is the law now and that was clearly the law in 1985 when James Stringer's conviction became final.</text>

            <text syncTime="889.331" offset="3684487">In order to answer the question that is before the Court today, that is whether Clemons or Maynard are to be retroactively applied, we must examine how the Mississippi statutory scheme works and operates in the imposition of a death sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1224.914" offset="5026867">Probably so, but we weren't discussing, I don't think, new rules at that point, of whether this was a new ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.003" offset="5067200">Clemons, as the Court started off its opinion by saying, that we are now addressing the question that we left open in Zant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.656" offset="5101786">I mean I think that is almost a total answer of the question whether it's a new rule or not there, because if the Court has never spoken to this issue and they speak to it, and that's what the Court said, the opinion says in Clemons, we now address that question we left open in Zant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.322" offset="5164480">And our court had been relying on Zant all this time in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.164" offset="5183811">And now Clemons comes down and says that you have to do it another way, that you have to do a reweighing or a harmless error analysis now instead of just what you have been doing under Zant... or relying on Zant in doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.063" offset="5243474">So the... of course as we said, the aggravating factors under the Mississippi statute act as actually a second filter that's not constitutionally required, and of course, reading Lowenfield, I think it is consistent with the way the Mississippi statute operates is that these aggravating factors take on a different significance under the Mississippi statute... under the Louisiana statute than they do in Georgia, Florida, and Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.550" offset="5377430">We define narrowly as does Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.282" offset="5392268">We define narrowly as does Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.281" offset="5404284">And this Court has said that no more was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.327" offset="5416509">So if Clemons stands for the fact that yes, there is... these aggravating circumstances in Mississippi do have constitutional significance, then that is a new rule because it has not been stated before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.758" offset="5474188">And as relying on the ruling in Johnson v. Thigpen out of the Fifth Circuit where they said the aggravating circumstances had no constitutional significance, were not even cognizable in Federal habeas, and that takes care of both Maynard and Clemons as being new rules there, because both of them address aggravating circumstances and the same aggravating circumstance, for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.045" offset="5579409">In other words, the Court is actually for the first time saying that relevant admissible truthful evidence presented during... to the jury during a sentence phase of a capital trial was given constitutional significance because it was denoted in aggravating circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1436.796" offset="5874384">Up until that time, the court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.420" offset="5884833">And in the concurring opinion in Johnson... Jones v. State, Montecarlo Jones v. State, the concurrence talks about Johnson v. Thigpen and says the Federal courts, being neutral observers, have found no constitutional infirmity or even constitutional necessity in our aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.862" offset="5978665">Yes, I think on a State law basis they have looked to Florida somewhat in the aggravating circumstance area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.345" offset="6012519">But they stand for different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.467" offset="6033104">I mean, Florida's aggravating circumstance... and our State has given some significance to these, you know, under State law, this is the way that it has to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.980" offset="6063092">And we have... you have to find these things in order to take that second step and weigh those aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and then the jury must find whether or not death is the appropriate sentence after, and if the aggravating circumstances outweigh I think, in this particular case, it must outweigh the mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.159" offset="6143863">Under the statute, the mitigating have to outweigh the aggravating, but that's no... just here it's just turned around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.969" offset="6171030">But we're considering evidence... we don't have evidence coming to the jury that they couldn't have before them in any other... you know, it was totally admissible, everything that was considered in relation to the especially heinous, atrocious or cruel aggravating factor... photographs, the argument, everything in support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.539" offset="6257339">Even had it not been denoted an aggravating factor, the jury still could have considered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.881" offset="6278759">And Mississippi does allow for the consideration of nonstatutory aggravating factors, they have to find the others, but the jury can certainly consider those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.111" offset="6319615">They have said in Jordan v. State, and just most recently in Hanson v. State, that the jury certainly can consider nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.061" offset="6363396">They can't rest the death penalty solely on that as a finding there, but they can certainly consider them in assessing whether or not the death penalty should be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.728" offset="6402057">And that's the ones that they have mentioned, mainly, as future dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.351" offset="6420552">So we look to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.086" offset="6435494">They can consider these other factors other than that, but they do have to find at least one aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.441" offset="6468931">And as we contend under Mississippi law, is contrary to Godfrey, a jury in Mississippi could never return a death sentence based solely on especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.013" offset="6515220">They have first always found that defendant guilty of one of the narrowly defined crimes set out... and there were seven crimes set out in our statute that carry or elevate the crime to a capital murder offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.352" offset="6572585">And then after they have been convicted of that, then the jury must look at aggravating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.320" offset="6588467">We have never had a jury come back with a verdict even at that, and have solely the especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravating factor as the only aggravating factor that they considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.781" offset="6638309">So even if you had a, as Justice Souter was talking, the second narrowing or a double narrowing statute... and we've called it a double narrowing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.684" offset="6673940">That's not something that we have not used a term in describing our statute, that is a double narrowing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.245" offset="6708212">Even so, when you look at that, it's what makes that second one the finding of one aggravating circumstance, then you get into a Zant-type analysis then and what is the effect of the invalid aggravating circumstance at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.426" offset="6772892">Does it then skew that balance to the point, and of course, looking at Barclay and Goode, and the type of analysis this Court and the Florida court made in both those cases, it's no different than what the Mississippi supreme court has been doing all these years in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.886" offset="6854707">It's not what was stated in Clemons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.040" offset="6871321">Petitioner brings up Parker v. Dugger; of course, retroactivity is not raised in Parker v. Dugger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.255" offset="6900160">It was not addressed in the briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.380" offset="6916669">And whether that was an oversight... whatever it was, we do not feel that it is compelling or a binding precedent that Clemons has to be applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.579" offset="6969541">The cases are differently situated anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.350" offset="7048536">This, in fact, this case, Smith v. Black, and Hill v. Black, all came to the Fifth Circuit after Clemons, or either were... had hardly been decided in this Court, sent back for reconsideration in light of Clemons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.673" offset="7105900">And our argument there was that this case in fact, this is a new rule and that it is, you know, Teague barred from retroactive effect of these opinions, both Maynard and Clemons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.386" offset="7164728">The Fifth Circuit's main opinion in this, of course, is not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.728" offset="7182074">It is in Smith v. Black where Judge King has written a quite lengthy analysis of why these precedents... this precedent especially, the Clemons precedent, is not retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.566" offset="7229407">In the particular case, bar, the Fifth Circuit basically just said we adopt and we reaffirm and reinstate our earlier judgment based on Smith v. Black, the same thing they have done also in a case called Hill v. Black, which was also sent back for reconsideration in light of Clemons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.980" offset="7307148">So we have two other cases, at least two other cases pending on this same issue in the Fifth Circuit, before this Court, in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.368" offset="7344660">Smith is already before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.023" offset="7351243">But that is where the full opinion is delineating how the Fifth Circuit arrived at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.942" offset="7378932">And I think Judge King's analysis there is very clear that this is the first time that constitutional limits had been put on how aggravating factors ought to be considered in Mississippi because of the difference in the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.170" offset="7447896">And because we do have, and this Court's precedent allows for, difference in the manner in which we apply our statutes or the statutes that are operating, then we can say... we contend that we have to look at the individual statute and how it operates in order to decide whether or not certain precedents would have retroactive effect on that particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.238" offset="7540160">And of course, we would further contend that the... that this is simply a procedurally... and it doesn't fit into the exceptions of Teague either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.671" offset="7585822">First, it doesn't outlaw any private conduct or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.467" offset="7605048">It's not a watershed rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.747" offset="7614139">Both our decisions relating to procedurally flawed contemplation or review are relevant evidence, and that's not something that would kick in the second exception to Teague.</text>

            <text syncTime="1913.778" offset="7782263">But if that State has determined that statutory aggravating circumstances play an important role in determining eligibility for sentence, as Mississippi has, each statutory aggravating circumstance must meet a constitutional narrow standard derived from Furman.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.063" offset="8055399">Lowenfield has nothing to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.202" offset="8063967">Johnson v. Thigpen, in answer to Justice White's question, did the Fifth Circuit find that Mississippi's construction of especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, was vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.291" offset="8112346">The Fifth Circuit found that it was vague in Johnson v. Thigpen, and in later cases assumed that it had no narrowing construction that had been consistently applied.</text>

Cartwright and Clemons... the fundamental principal that if a vague aggravating circumstance is injected into the jury's consideration, there is constitutional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.426" offset="9264869">Because that's what... that's what the problem was in Furman.</text>
