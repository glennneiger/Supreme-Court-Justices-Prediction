            <text syncTime="8.986" offset="126857">This case involves a facial challenge to a regulation promulgated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.062" offset="155070">It provides that when an alien is released from custody pending deportation or exclusion proceedings, the bond issued to secure the alien's release will generally include a condition barring unauthorized employment by the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.420" offset="220585">The Court of Appeals ruled that the regulation was inconsistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.522" offset="248902">For the reasons set forth in a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Stevens, we hold that the regulation properly construed as wholly consistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.434" offset="284637">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.</text>
