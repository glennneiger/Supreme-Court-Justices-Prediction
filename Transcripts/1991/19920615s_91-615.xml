            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90918">The opinion of the Court in No. 91-615, Allied-Signal, Inc. versus the Director of the Division of Taxation will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="11.637" offset="137416">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.431" offset="152567">The petitioner is a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.028" offset="158941">It is called Allied-Signal and it is the successor in interest to the Bendix Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.562" offset="185063">It is a Delaware Corporation with its commercial domicile in its corporate headquarters in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.349" offset="204289">The dispute concerns Bendix's business tax liability to the State of New Jersey for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.535" offset="236995">That was the year that Bendix sold something over a 20% interest in a corporation called ASARCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.872" offset="270327">It realized a gain of $211 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.169" offset="287568">The Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation sought to include that $211 million in Bendix's apportionable tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.167" offset="323512">Based on a stipulated record, the Sate Tax Court held that a disputed gain was properly included and the Appellate Division affirmed that decision as to the Supreme Court of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.647" offset="361442">The State Supreme Court held that the gain was earned in the course of Bendix's so-called unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.136" offset="383385">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.052" offset="391117">In an opinion filed today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.739" offset="397805">Both the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Constitution forbid a state from taxing value earned outside its borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.143" offset="427480">Because of the complications and uncertainties in allocating the income of multistate business to this several states, we permit the states to tax a corporation on an apportionable share of the multistate business that is carried on in the taxing state.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.468" offset="492786">This is the unitary business principle and it has been a part of our jurisprudence for over a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.883" offset="514415">Our precedents established that the existence of the unitary business depends on functional integration, centralization of management, and economies of scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.311" offset="548061">We adhere to those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.727" offset="557778">New Jersey argues that all income earned by a corporation should be treated as income earned in the course of a unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.647" offset="581498">Principles of stare decisis prevent us from adapting the sweeping doctrinal change.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.071" offset="599156">It is not in accord with a well-established and substantial case law in the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.725" offset="613785">The stipulated record in this case makes quite clear that none of the criteria of a unitary business were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.474" offset="636773">Bendix had no capacity to control ASARCO and they were run as separate businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.729" offset="657775">While we agree with the suggestion of several amici that a short term investment of idol funds which serves an operational function maybe apportionable even absent a unitary relation between the payer and he payee.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.486" offset="708766">The record in this case makes it clear that Bendix's acquisition and disposition of its ASARCO shares cannot be characterized this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.190" offset="739591">Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.338" offset="768221">Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice, Justice Blackmun, and Justice Thomas join.</text>
