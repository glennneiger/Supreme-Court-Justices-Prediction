            <text syncTime="11.162" offset="135480">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.196" offset="151572">Respondents are railroad workers who sued their employer, the petitioner here, in Trial Court for Yellowstone County, Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.978" offset="182710">The petitioner, Burlington, a company incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in Texas, moved for a change of venue to the Trial Court of Hill County, Montana saying that it had its principal place of business in Montana in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.157" offset="235477">The Trial Court denied the motion and the Supreme Court of Montana affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.886" offset="254390">Under Montana's venue rules, a company incorporated in Montana may be sued only in the county where it has its principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.340" offset="284169">The company incorporated elsewhere, on the other hand, may be sued in any of Montana's 56 counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.006" offset="306843">Burlington says that this discrimination violates the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.316" offset="324084">In a unanimous opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana and hold that the Montana rules are constitutional because they rationally further a legitimate state purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.171" offset="367447">Montana could have assumed that a company's headquarters are a greater importance to its convenience in litigation than a company's other offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.238" offset="395764">That companies incorporated in Montana likely have headquarters in Montana and that companies incorporated elsewhere likely do no have headquarters in Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.291" offset="432022">On these assumptions, Montana could reasonably decide that only the convenience to a corporate defendant of litigating where its headquarters are is sufficient to outweigh a plaintiff's interest in suing in the county of his choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.882" offset="482386">Burlington has failed to show that the assumption that corporate defendants incorporated outside of Montana are unlikely to have their headquarters in Montana is irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.904" offset="522406">Besides, Burlington has its headquarters in Texas and is, therefore, in no position to complain.</text>
