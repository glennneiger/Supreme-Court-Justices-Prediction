            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="146648">We'll hear argument now in Case No. 90-925, The Immigration and Nationalization Service v. Joseph Patrick Doherty.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.706" offset="193459">You may proceed, Ms. Mahoney.</text>

            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="53.385" offset="360121">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.087" offset="374958">In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the Attorney General of the United States abused his discretion in denying Mr. Doherty's motion to reopen his deportation hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.477" offset="428457">The court of appeals accordingly remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on Mr. Doherty's claim that he should be granted asylum in the United States and that he should be deported to some country other than the United Kingdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.337" offset="487912">We request this Court to reverse the decision of the Second Circuit on two independent grounds that I would like outline briefly in order to clarify what the issues are for this Court to decide today.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.514" offset="540679">First, we ask this Court to hold that the Attorney General had discretion to deny reopening because Mr. Doherty did not establish that he had good cause for failing to raise his claims for asylum and withholding of deportation at his deportation hearing in September of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.677" offset="629286">The Attorney General determined that he had a full and fair opportunity to raise those claims at that hearing and that he deliberately abandoned the claims as part of a tactical strategy that ultimately failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.551" offset="676829">If this Court finds that the Attorney General properly denied reopening on this ground, and that this was not an arbitrary or unseasoned abuse of discretion, then it need not reach any of the other issues in this case, because that ground would in and of itself would be dispositive under this Court's decision in INS v. Abudu.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.916" offset="766272">As a second and independent ground of reversal, we ask this Court to find that the Attorney General properly exercised his discretion in determining that Mr. Doherty's claims for withholding of deportation and asylum were just simply not sufficiently meritorious to warrant the extraordinary remedy of reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.966" offset="866478">I'd like to turn first to the issue of whether or not Mr. Doherty established good cause for failure to file his claims or pursue his claims in September 1986 at his deportation hearing, since we submit that this Court's decision in INS v. Abudu is in fact controlling on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.795" offset="945786">On three prior occasions in the last 10 years, this Court has looked at the question of what the Attorney General or the Board of Immigration Appeals' discretion is to deny reopening for failure to show good cause to raise the claim at the initial deportation hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.074" offset="1018929">In all three occasions in this Court's decision in Rios-Pineda, in the Wang decision, and most recently in Abudu, this Court found that the denial of reopening on these grounds must be sustained unless the decision is arbitrary and unreasoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.452" offset="1084444">We submit that there is simply no way that the Attorney General's determination on this issue in this case was arbitrary or unreasoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.606" offset="1117045">This Court's decision in Abudu illustrates that there are essentially two interrelated requirements for establishing good cause to file an application for withholding of deportation or asylum after the deportation hearing has been closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.519" offset="1192695">And these requirements are, first, under the regulations, Mr. Doherty is required to reasonably explain, to provide a legally sufficient explanation of why he did not raise the claims or pursue the claims at the initial deportation hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.112" offset="1251001">And second, he must also show that his claims for withholding of deportation and asylum are based upon evidence or circumstance that arose subsequent to the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.551" offset="1296767">I'd like to turn first to the issue of whether or not Mr. Doherty has ever provided a reasonable explanation of why he didn't pursue these claims in September of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.025" offset="1338668">The Attorney General found that the reason that he didn't pursue the claims in September of 1986 was that he had an opportunity to do so, but he was... it was part of an effort on his part to designate Ireland as the country of deportation, to withdraw his claims for asylum and withholding of deportation, and to try to expedite his deportation so that he could reach Ireland before the supplemental extradition treaty took effect.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="328.794" offset="1461757">Was it customary that people faced with deportation could indicate the country they'd like to go to, and if the country were willing to accept them that normally that's where the person would be sent?</text>
            <text syncTime="346.006" offset="1530615">Was that the standard practice?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maureen_e_mahoney" startTime="349.374" stopTime="407.878">
            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="349.374" offset="1544095">Your Honor, under the statute, under 243(a), an alien has the opportunity to designate the country that he wants to be deported to.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.480" offset="1584532">But the statute specifically provides that the Attorney General may reject that designation if, in his view, it would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.419" offset="1624238">And the standard practice before the immigration judges that's been in effect for many years, in fact probably 50 years, is that when a national of a country designates a country other than his country of nationality, the immigration judge gives him an opportunity to submit a claim for withholding of deportation or asylum to the country of nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.920" offset="1726325">The whole idea here is that it is critical to the process that all of the defenses to deportation be asserted at the time of the deportation hearing in order to avoid piecemeal appeals.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="407.878" stopTime="416.750">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="407.878" offset="1778152">Was it at all a surprise that the Attorney General designated the United Kingdom instead of Ireland as had been designated?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maureen_e_mahoney" startTime="416.750" stopTime="504.939">
            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="416.750" offset="1813574">Your Honor, I do not believe it was a surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.350" offset="1824023">The INS took the position at the hearing in September of '86 that it was the position of the United States that Mr. Doherty should not be deported to Ireland, that it would be prejudicial to the United States' interests, that this was an issue of serious concern at the highest levels, and when that argument was rejected by the immigration judge, the INS indicated that it would appeal that decision because it was sufficiently concerned that deportation to Ireland would be prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.971" offset="1946485">So there really can be no question that Mr. Doherty understood in September of 1986 that he was at risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.975" offset="1974488">And similarly, Your Honor, there was no reason why he couldn't plead in the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.712" offset="1993401">In this Court's decision in Abudu, Dr. Abudu was in precisely the same kind of circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.016" offset="2022658">He designated England as the country that he wanted to be deported to, but he was a national of Ghana.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.187" offset="2047317">So the immigration judge in that case, just like the immigration judge in this case, gave him the opportunity to apply for withholding of deportation to Ghana and for asylum, an opportunity that Dr. Abudu did not avail himself of.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.946" offset="2106354">And thereafter when he sought to reopen the proceedings in order to do that, this Court found that he was barred, because you are permitted to plead in the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.968" offset="2142508">There's simply no reason... the issue in September of 1986 that was presented--</text>

            <text syncTime="1761.000" offset="7190619">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.342" offset="7244013">This case raises a fundamental question about the circumstances under which the Attorney General can deny the relief of withholding of deportation, a form of protection that is mandatory under the Refugee Act, to an individual who has been found to have established prima facie entitlement to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.308" offset="7343801">For now almost a decade, the executive branch of the United States Government has labored to hand over to the British Government the individual that we have represented, Joseph Doherty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.103" offset="7410988">Its efforts have been consistently rebuffed, both judicially and administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.192" offset="7447350">The litigation has been fueled by executive branch displeasure with a 1984 decision by a United States District Court judge denying the request of the British Government for Mr. Doherty's extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.439" offset="7524359">That decision categorically denied the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.759" offset="7549646">The district court judge, in rejecting the request, stated that the acts for which Mr. Doherty was sought were not common crimes, nor were they capable of being categorized as acts of terrorism, but rather they were political offenses and verbatim in their most classic form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.392" offset="7648179">The issues that are now before this Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="1887.016" offset="7694677">One set were acts of which Mr. Doherty had been convicted in absentia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.336" offset="7719964">The other set were acts with which he was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.455" offset="7732398">The first set of which he had been convicted involved the shooting death of a member of the Secret Air Service, a member of the British Army, in an encounter between the IRA and the British Army in North Belfast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.833" offset="7801884">Mr. Doherty was one of the members of the IRA that was engaged in that operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.487" offset="7824558">And the district judge found that it had been an ambush set up to engage and attack a British military convoy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1939.665" offset="7905224">--In that trial, Your Honor, he was convicted of murder, attempted murder, possession of weapons, and for being a member of a proscribed organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.422" offset="7944304">The second set of offenses, to return to your question, Justice Scalia, had to do with Mr. Doherty's escape under orders of the IRA with seven other members of the IRA from a British prison in Belfast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.098" offset="8006997">The district court judge determined that both sets of offenses were political and his extradition could not be had for any of the offenses for which his extradition was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.005" offset="8054645">The issues, however, before this Court now are the outgrowth of executive branch displeasure with that decision, and its long campaign to escape the force and effect of the decision denying Mr. Doherty's extradition to the United Kingdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.986" offset="8138550">These issues, therefore, cannot properly be understood apart from the tortuous history of this case, now almost a decade long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.877" offset="8182122">For with each decision adverse to it, the executive branch has resorted to legal positions more singular and more extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.566" offset="8224859">Thus it is that the Attorney General now claims the power to withhold from an individual the relief of withholding of deportation, even though that individual has established prima facie entitlement to it, and even though that form of protection is mandatory under the Refugee Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.781" offset="8321721">And the Attorney General is utterly without discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2069.332" offset="8423912">But the fact of the matter is that in order to be interpreted consistently with the convention and protocol that literally gave birth to the concept in American domestic law of withholding of deportation, that discretion is not in this case absolute or without limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.745" offset="8509593">And the reason for that is this very, very significant holding of the Board of Immigration Appeals in conjunction with a motion to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.785" offset="8545747">And that is, Your Honor, the Board of Immigration Appeals established that Mr. Doherty had met the initial threshold.</text>

            <text syncTime="2359.953" offset="9586361">Because the very things that the Attorney General asserted as the basis on which he premised his denial were the very acts that were found by another factfinder in the basis of an adversarial context where we did have an opportunity to put forward evidence and contest them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2382.650" offset="9677162">But of course, the fact of the matter is, is that it is accepted that the political offense exception is really the mirror image of the nonpolitical crimes aspect of asylum law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.894" offset="9738184">Both exist to provide protection that is viewed under the law as being legitimate to people who commit political offenses, or who in the asylum context may even commit crimes, but still under withholding of deportation, be entitled to protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.225" offset="9819477">So we think that on the basis of this record, Justice Kennedy, that's what makes this wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="2885.074" offset="11686919">There is a very curious aspect of the Attorney General's decision here which your question alluded to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.364" offset="11720042">And that is that although the Attorney General accepts that the facts that he chose to rely on from the extradition proceeding were correct, he admits in his opinion that in effect, he does not have to find that Joseph Doherty himself committed serious nonpolitical crimes, that it's adequate if he can find that the Irish Republican Army committed serious nonpolitical crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.247" offset="11823592">In effect, it is a tacit admission that there is not in this record any evidence that Joseph Doherty committed serious nonpolitical crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.770" offset="11865701">And the thing that is most compelling about this, and indeed most chilling, is that the Attorney General ultimately bases his decision on what he refers to as material that is exhaustively documented... that's his phrase, exhaustively documented, in the record of another case, another immigration case altogether to which we were not a party, and which did not involve issues that were even remotely identical to the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.424" offset="11996313">Consequently, we think to have relied on that and to have made the determination, number one, without letting us have a hearing, and then on the basis of facts that are in another record altogether, really did deprive us of any opportunity to establish entitlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3081.666" offset="12473309">The fact of the matter is that all that Mr. Doherty was doing was making an effort to avoid being deported to a country where he had a well-founded fear of persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.759" offset="12529629">That I do not think constitutes manipulation of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.312" offset="12555856">And in an effort to do that, Justice O'Connor, he availed himself of an option that is available under the statute to designate a country of deportation, in effect to accomplish his own removal from this country at the expense of at that time going forward on an asylum claim because he knew that he would not be rejected by Ireland.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.274" offset="13039644">Mr. Meese's order was material because what it did was to transform the possibility that Mr. Doherty would not be... let me start again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.886" offset="13110175">The significance of the Meese decision was that it in effect ensured that Mr. Doherty was going to be returned directly to a country where he feared persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.111" offset="13159076">That was the significance of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.480" offset="13168480">We had filed the motion to reopen within 48 hours of the implementation of the Extradition Act of 1987 because under that act, Justice O'Connor, what we feared was indirect return, but certain return to a country of persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.393" offset="13252176">So both of those were absolutely material under the reopening standards that the regulations set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.147" offset="13283210">And we do not think in any way that the Meese decision vitiates what had been the original integrity of the claim under the Extradition Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.428" offset="13468261">But he made that order, and the Second Circuit appreciated that order as being made in the context of a motion to reopen that also involved claims for relief from deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.053" offset="13522805">So the fact of the matter is that even though that order directed his deportation to the United Kingdom, that order is not subject to being acted on until Mr. Doherty's claims for relief under the Refugee Act are properly adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.897" offset="13586230">And if I might, in a desperate attempt to try to finish the notion of why the waiver did not here obtain, under the normal situation, which everybody agrees did not happen here, if indeed there had been any perceived risk of deportation to the United Kingdom, the country where Mr. Doherty feared persecution, the immigration judge would have been obligated to go forward, to afford him the opportunity then and there to proceed on his asylum claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.920" offset="13738263">The record reveals that that never happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.955" offset="13750384">And it never happened because unlike other cases, in this case, it was already known at that point in time, there was no uncertainty, the Irish Government had indicated it would accept him into the national territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.782" offset="13801688">That was where he was going.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.548" offset="13808793">That was the country he had designated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.317" offset="13819869">And therefore, the immigration judge saw no purpose to go forward on a claim for asylum to prevent deportation to a country where he wasn't going to be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.743" offset="13873577">It was that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.593" offset="13880996">And the asylum claim, the asylum hearing did not go forward at that point in time for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.830" offset="13905864">I would like finally to respond in this point to one other point that had been made by our adversary relative to the Extradition Act and the fact that there was no material change in the law as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.791" offset="13985799">The fact of the matter is that there was indeed a very material change that was worked by the Extradition Act, and that has to be appreciated in the context of providing the adequate basis for Mr. Doherty's motion to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.234" offset="14039507">The Extradition Act, 1987, as a matter of black-letter law, wrote out of existence the political offense exception to extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.692" offset="14085378">Whatever the Irish courts may have done prior to that really does not in any way obtain in terms of the finality that was accomplished once the Extradition Act was implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.135" offset="14151102">Once it was, there was no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.920" offset="14162282">That defense was not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.105" offset="14171059">That was the defense that Mr. Doherty had successfully defended against extradition with here, and we had every reason to believe that he could have successfully defended against extradition there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.180" offset="14219334">Certainly he had a strong case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.882" offset="14230096">But with the passage of the Extradition Act--</text>

            <text syncTime="3544.980" offset="14326540">And we felt that given the facts of Mr. Doherty's case, that certainly he would still be able to go forward with that, and conceivably at least have the opportunity of defending against extradition on that ground.</text>

            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>

            <text syncTime="3592.395" offset="14516189">Just a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.830" offset="14521936">First, with respect to withholding, I'd like to emphasize that there simply is no question of fact to be resolved at an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.269" offset="14555686">Mr. Doherty's counsel had an opportunity before the Attorney General to put in whatever evidence they thought might be appropriate to show that there was an issue of fact, but there simply isn't one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.577" offset="14604901">The admissions that Mr. Doherty makes in his extradition transcript establish that there simply are serious reasons for the Attorney General to believe that serious nonpolitical offenses were committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.670" offset="14665296">Therefore, a hearing would serve no purpose, and that should not require the Attorney General to reopen the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.174" offset="14695285">In addition, I'd like to emphasize that the Attorney General did rely on a broader range of conduct in determining that serious nonpolitical offenses had been committed than those relied upon by Judge Sprizzo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.898" offset="14746171">Judge Sprizzo focused very particularly on the basically the murder of the British captain, and simply mentioned in passing that no civilians were injured on May 2nd of 1980, whereas the Attorney General focused specifically on the fact that Mr. Doherty sought to pursue his own political motives not only through the killing of the British captain, but also through deliberate acts of violence directed at citizens of Northern Ireland on that day.</text>

            <text syncTime="3682.619" offset="14877097">No, Your Honor, that was in the extradition hearing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.321" offset="14891830">The facts surrounding the May '80 events that Mr. Doherty admitted were that his group hijacked a van, held the driver captive, forcibly seized a private residence in a residential neighborhood, held the family captive, and waged a gun battle with automatic weapons from the family's living room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.549" offset="14964764">The Attorney General found that that conduct was precisely the type of conduct that endangered innocent civilians and could not... and had to be regarded as serious nonpolitical offenses.</text>
