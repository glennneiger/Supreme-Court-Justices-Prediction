            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="10.689" offset="192131">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.573" offset="215642">This original action is before the Court on cross motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.103" offset="233718">The question presented is whether the Secretary of the Army acted within his authority when he refused to issue a permit for construction of the Nome Port Facility unless Alaska agreed that the construction would be deemed not to alter the location of the Federal/State boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.504" offset="295367">Some historical background is necessary to understand this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.237" offset="310309">This Court ruled in a 1947 decision, California I, that the Federal Government rather than the individual States owns offshore submerged lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.084" offset="349702">6 years later Congress enacted two statutes: the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act; and the Submerged Lands Act which divided the offshore submerged lands between the Federal and State governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.040" offset="393483">Congress gave the States those submerged extending, as a general matter, 3 miles from the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.185" offset="418038">A dispute then arose whether coastal construction such as port facilities should be treated as part of the coastline for purposes of the Submerged Lands Act grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.561" offset="455550">This Court ruled in California II that harbor work should be treated as part of the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.676" offset="480001">The Court concludes that there was no inequity in measuring the coast submerged lands grant based on structures that the State itself had built, because the United States, through its control over navigable waters, had the power to protect its interests from encroachment and quote, the effect of any future changes could thus be the subject of agreement between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.777" offset="556487">The Army, which issues permits for offshore structures under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act revised its permitting regulations in response to the California II decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.295" offset="598492">Those regulations now provide that the Army will take into account the effect of the proposed coastal construction on the Federal/State boundary when determining whether to issue a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.730" offset="640288">The Army applied those regulations to the City of Nome's proposed port facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.635" offset="659932">The Army refused to issue the permit unless Alaska disclaimed entitlement to any additional submerged lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.059" offset="681562">Alaska argues that the Army had no authority to impose that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.180" offset="698071">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.441" offset="703086">Congress has directed the Army to regulate the placement of structures in navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.003" offset="721372">The relevant statute, section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, contains a complete prohibition on the creation of any obstruction to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.829" offset="756690">It then gives the Secretary of the Army the power to allow exceptions on a case-by-case basis where structure work is recommended by the Corps of Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.226" offset="794202">Thus, section 10 expresses a legislative policy against the placement of structures in navigable waters except where the Secretary affirmatively determines that the structure should be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.715" offset="836206">Section 10 does not identify specific factors the Secretary should take into account in authorizing such structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.880" offset="868912">The Secretary accordingly takes into account a whole range of factors relevant to the public interest in light of the policies Congress has articulated in other laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.875" offset="904856">This public interest review process is certainly reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.258" offset="918335">Nothing in section 10 suggests the Army should exercise its permitting authority without regard to the policies that Congress has stated elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.962" offset="949160">This Court recognized that point in United States v. Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Corp., and Greathouse v. Dern, which both indicate that the Rivers and Harbors Act gives the Secretary broad discretion to grant or deny permits.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="213.331" offset="1002659">Mr. Minear, can I ask, what is the Government's position under section 10 and under this waiver or for that matter, under all waivers, with respect to a natural accretion that is caused by the construction of the artificial structure?</text>

            <text syncTime="230.502" offset="1071308">That is a factor that would be taken into account in building the structure, and I think that is a very relevant point in this sense, the structure might cause downstream erosion, shoreline accretion, which could result in actually bringing the boundary landward and would affect the State's grant of submerged lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.607" offset="1155736">That is a factor that the Army will take into account in determining whether to issue a structure.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.264" offset="1202443">But suppose the permit is issued subject to a waiver such as this; does the waiver include the State's power over any extension of the State's boundary caused by natural accretion which is in turn attributable to the artificial structure?</text>

            <text syncTime="284.727" offset="1288229">Under the specific terms of this disclaimer, much depends on how the disclaimer is worded.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.782" offset="1308500">You have to go and figure out how much natural accretion along the shoreline is caused by the construction of a jetty that was subject to a waiver like this?</text>
            <text syncTime="302.237" offset="1358342">It makes it awful complicated, doesn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="304.159" offset="1365970">With all respect, Your Honor, this is only going to arise in most cases with respect to the leasing of mineral rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.714" offset="1392197">If the State or the Federal Government decides to lease mineral rights, it will in fact issue a notice and the parties will contact the relevant agencies, any party interested in leasing property, to locate the boundary.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.793" offset="1452487">No, but it is the case that I just can't look at the shoreline and say, well, except for natural structures, I know that the 3-mile is measured from the shoreline and you are telling me that if some of that shoreline may be up-current or down-current, I don't know how accretion works, has been altered by reason of the artificial structure, I cannot count that part of the shoreline for determining the 3-mile limit.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="352.002" offset="1557395">Well, Your Honor, that is a practical consequence of the way this particular disclaimer is worded.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.955" offset="1577144">A disclaimer could eliminate that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.286" offset="1586443">The likelihood of the problem arising is also minimized by the fact that one aspect of this project is a littoral drift monitoring program which was designed to assure that there would be no accretion or erosion as a result of the construction of this structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.236" offset="1646316">The party that has the permit here, the City of Nome, is under an obligation to monitor any such changes, and if they do occur, it is under an obligation to prevent them from occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.532" offset="1687485">So although this raises a theoretical difficulty under this particular disclaimer, I don't think it has a great deal of practical consequence in light of other factors relevant to the--</text>

            <text syncTime="480.174" offset="2070022">There is a need for stability with respect to boundaries, particularly boundaries for submerged lands that can be subject to accretion or erosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.379" offset="2102832">So the Corps' basic perspective on this is that we don't want the structure to be altering settled expectations with respect to property rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.025" offset="2137418">So the structure... the point of my earlier question, Mr. Minear, is that I am inclined to agree with the Government that section 10 allows you to take into account whether it will alter the ownership of submerged lands, but to say that you can take it into account is not to say that can condition the permission upon this kind of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.390" offset="2226861">The greater does not necessarily include the lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.592" offset="2235743">And if indeed one of the consequences of having these waivers is that the shoreline is always going to be subject to debate as to whether some natural accretion has occurred by reason of an artificial structure under such a waiver, I am more inclined to think that your choice is either to let it go forward in which case the coast is altered as the structure causes, or else, not let it go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.351" offset="2414734">Much depends on how the disclaimer might be crafted and in fact, the Army allows the State to draft a disclaimer and then determines whether or not the disclaimer would appropriately protect Federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.829" offset="2456634">But the ultimate interest that the Federal Government is asserting here is in fact the stability of title, the fact that we do want to have certainty.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.111" offset="3237800">First of all, the United States grant or the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act extends to the end of the outer continental shelf, so it is fixed... it is a geographic matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.787" offset="3284507">In this case, all of the land up around Norton Sound is continental shelf, it is all less than 200 meters deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.383" offset="3314913">And this particular location is on Norton Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.475" offset="3327243">If you went south from Nome through Norton Sound, you would eventually hit Alaska again.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.518" offset="3347410">Nome is located on the Seward Peninsula.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.941" offset="3361098">As a more general matter, even if you had a straight boundary and you were extending the line, I think it is helpful to look at the map we have, the last page of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.957" offset="3405193">The effect of adding a point on the coastline is to create an are of additional land that is created, that is encompassed within the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.775" offset="3452422">So although the causeway only occupies 5 acres, it ends up transferring, if there were no disclaimer, over 700 acres of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.451" offset="3487113">Now in the case of a straight boundary, where we would be concerned perhaps with the 200-mile exclusive economic zone limit, this is another boundary that we have that is apart from what we have discussed here, using the causeway to extend the exclusive economic zone could extend that, but it would only be if it was an absolutely straight coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.954" offset="3569137">If there was some other point upstream or downstream that also goes out, the drawing of the arc would in fact eliminate the factor that you get from the causeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.961" offset="3609157">Now the Secretary's consideration of the effect of the proposed structure and the location of the causeway is simply one part of its public interest review process.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.368" offset="3650848">As the Secretary's regulations recognize, the location of the coastline has great significance because it can determine the location of international and Federal/State boundaries, and even where foreign relations concerns are absent, a shift in the location of the coastline can, as in this case, divest the United States of its interests in the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.488" offset="3723259">Congress has stated that the outer continental shelf is a vital national resource reserve, held by the Federal Government for the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.485" offset="3759308">Thus, it is entirely proper for the Secretary to consider, as one element of the public interest review, the effect of a proposed structure on the location of the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.161" offset="3793999">In the absence of such a review, portions of a vital national resource reserve would be transferred without any formal Government consideration from Federal to State hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.547" offset="3831511">The Secretary's public interest review process, including his consideration of the effects of the proposed structure on the location of the coastline, reflects a commitment to faithful execution of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.136" offset="3889921">It ensures the Secretary takes full account of all of Congress' policies before he authorizes construction that can impact on a wide variety of public concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.064" offset="3929627">It is also consistent with this Court's decision in California II, which recognized that the United States has the ability to protect itself from artificial changes in the coastline through its power over navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.830" offset="3976647">Furthermore, it produces a sensible result.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.173" offset="3990022">In this instance, the City of Nome applied for a permit to construct port facilities projecting more than 1/2 mile into Norton Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.248" offset="4018339">The Army learned through consultation with the Solicitor of the Interior Department that the resulting change in the coastline would divest the United States of potentially valuable mineral resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.245" offset="4062329">The Army therefore reasonably insisted that a permit would not be issued unless Alaska entered into an agreement preserving the existing Federal/State boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.881" offset="4096915">The Army was entitled to deny the permit because of the adverse affect that the construction would have on the location for the boundary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.874" offset="4236827">However, there is no active leasing program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.145" offset="4245917">There might be such a program in 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.768" offset="4260442">I also understand that a permit has been issued for gold prospecting as opposed to simple leasing for exploration in the Norton Sound area as well, and that is for gold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.512" offset="4295341">I would like to note some of Alaska's arguments here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.758" offset="4324389">Alaska mistakenly argues that section 10 limits the Army's inquiry to navigational and environmental concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.683" offset="4352079">Section 10 contains no such limitation and indeed, suggests a far broader inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.615" offset="4375798">Virtually any structure place in navigable waters obstructs navigation, and section 10 authorizes the Secretary to allow such a structure, despite the adverse impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.022" offset="4413415">So obviously the Secretary must look to factors other than navigation in determining whether to issue a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.617" offset="4439851">As Alaska concedes, there is no dispute that the Army can take into account the public interest, including Congress' environmental policies, in determining whether to issue a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.352" offset="4474750">There is no principle basis for distinguishing between Congress' policies articulated in environmental laws and those articulated in other statutes such as the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.670" offset="4516024">Alaska is also mistaken in arguing that the result we urge here will detract from this Court's supposed goal of a single coastline for international and domestic purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1163.638" offset="4803893">This Court determined in United States v. Louisiana that the coastline for the purpose of that grant would be determined on the basis of the coastline at the time of admission and would not include any subsequent artificial structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.126" offset="4857810">More recently, we stipulated to a coastline, a baseline for the purposes of closing the Chandeleur Sound off the coast of the State of Mississippi and that baseline also was not necessarily the same as the baseline that would be established for international purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.636" offset="4919877">Alaska is also mistaken in arguing that California II's discussion of the United States' control over navigable waters was made in reference to Congress' constitutional power over navigation rather than the Army's permitting authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.276" offset="4986437">The Court's reference to the Government's power to resolve future disputes by agreement can refer only to an executive power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.157" offset="5058012">In sum, we believe that the Army has the authority to require this sort of disclaimer in these circumstances, and we therefore request that the Court grant the United States motion for summary judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.938" offset="5409098">We believe that the Army Corps' disclaimer practice is open-ended and mandatory and missing the essence of the Submerged Lands Act and also some fundamental principles of Government in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.686" offset="5468135">This causes them to badly misjudge the public interest in both law and in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.099" offset="5493735">We don't believe that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act or the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 causes any other result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.339" offset="5538665">In essence, this is simply a case of statutory construction, whether the Army has the statutory authority to require a disclaimer that fixes a State's seaward boundary at a line that is different from the 3 miles from the coastline that was granted to the States by Congress in the Submerged Lands Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.369" offset="5730822">But we start with the coastline and I also want to emphasize that Alaska, although we were not a State when the Submerged Lands Act was passed, under our statehood compact we did become a State, specifically that compact provides us the benefits of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.560" offset="5795606">Congress, in enacting that Submerged Lands Act, spoke directly and clearly and couldn't have spoken more plainly that the States own submerged lands to 3 miles from the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.717" offset="5848164">They knew then, as has been known from the beginning of time, that coastlines are not stable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.852" offset="5872719">They change through all sorts of natural forces and manmade modifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.487" offset="5899259">Under acts of Congress and international law that has been adopted by this Court, the rule is that those ambulations of the coastline result in corresponding changes to the seaward boundary, wherever that is and whatever seaward boundary it happens to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.106" offset="5965819">In this case, we are talking about the 3-mile limit, but the same consequence happens on the 12-mile Federal territorial sea and on the 200-mile exclusive economic zone that the Federal Government has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.328" offset="6022662">This is a fact of life on the ocean and the Army Corps of Engineers cannot change that by administrative fiat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.253" offset="6054322">By doing this administratively and venting their own exception to this rule that Congress laid down, they are absolutely ignoring the Submerged Lands Act, which is the one single act that directly, squarely addresses the States' rights to submerged lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.880" offset="6528915">We don't believe they have that same discretion under Article 10 and here is why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.091" offset="6545738">Article 10 was developed for completely different reasons than Article 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.787" offset="6568517">Article 13 is to protect those waters from something that is bad, pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.049" offset="6585548">Article 10 is to do something good to those waters, to enhance the navigable capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.802" offset="6608536">In 1888 in the Willamette case, the courts of the United States said that there is no prohibition of putting any single obstruction in navigable waters in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.882" offset="6660886">So in 1890 the Congress enacted the precursor of this Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.905" offset="6688993">They purpose of that act was to enhance navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.609" offset="6703831">As a part of that, they told the Army Corps of Engineers that there will be no obstructions to the navigable capacity of the navigable waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.214" offset="6738208">When the Army Corps of Engineers takes that authority and says this means that from 1899 to the present day, we could say that nobody will build a pier, nobody will build a wharf, nobody will build a causeway, nobody can do anything in the waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.294" offset="6798499">We don't think that that is what Article 10 says.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.272" offset="6846459">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, from 1899 until 1968, the Army Corps of Engineers, by their own admission in the Federal Register cite that the Government has put in, took into account one factor, and that was navigation, enhancing navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.333" offset="6914691">If a project enhanced navigation they accounted for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.025" offset="6929424">In the 1960s and '70s, there is a series of cases saying that the Army Corps of Engineers is allowing things to happen that are destructive of the waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.352" offset="6966727">The Army Corps of Engineers can only consider public interest that is articulated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.337" offset="6994731">The first time this happened was in 1956 in the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.521" offset="7011449">In the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Army Corps could say, this project is good for navigation, but it is not good for anadromous fish, so therefore we are not going to put it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.607" offset="7047811">Then in 1969, the National Environmental Protection Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.649" offset="7067978">Before that though, the most important one was that in 1953, the Congress looked at the ownership of submerged lands offshore and they said the States are going to have it to 3 miles from the coastline.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.730" offset="12340219">First, I think it is important to focus on what the Army Corps of Engineers is faced with in these circumstances, and it is a very practical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.857" offset="12372820">Structures are built or parties apply to build structures in navigable waters, and what the Army Corps of Engineers does is attempt to evaluate all of the consequences of placing that structure in the water, both the physical and legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.764" offset="12424438">One of the consequences can be a change in the boundary and what the Army attempts to do is to maintain the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.359" offset="12450770">Now by keeping the boundary at the same location, that really serves the purposes of both acts here, both the Submerged Lands Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.637" offset="12483893">If gives effect to both of those statutes because both parties get what they had originally planned on receiving.</text>

            <text syncTime="3226.578" offset="13055661">Perhaps that same principle would apply in the outer continental shelf and the boundary, the coastline situation.</text>
