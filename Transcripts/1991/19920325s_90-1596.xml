            <text syncTime="13.114" offset="143354">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.535" offset="177000">Petitioners managed certain federally owned forests known to contain the northern spotted owl.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.980" offset="202809">Respondents filed two separate lawsuits against petitioners alleging that the proposed harvesting sale of timber from these forests would kill the owls in violation of five different federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.482" offset="260800">The courts below preliminary enjoined some of the challenge of harvesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.573" offset="281176">In response to the ongoing litigation, Congress enacted the Northwest Timber Compromise Subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5) of which prohibited harvesting all together from various designated areas within the affected forests.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.687" offset="345646">Subsection (b)(6)(A) stated that management of the forest according to these two provisions was adequate consideration to meet the statutory requirements underlying the two pending cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.241" offset="403847">The two District Courts considering these cases held that Subsection (b)(6)(A) had effectively modified the original statutory provisions, and that the Subsections so construed was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.412" offset="464451">In a consolidated appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.043" offset="478975">The court held that Subsection (b)(6)(A) did not amend any law but directed the courts to reach a particular result in pending cases under previously existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.047" offset="527040">Under that interpretation, the court held that Subsection (b)(6)(A) was unconstitutional under our decision in United States versus Klein.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.971" offset="570717">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.499" offset="592869">We conclude that Subsection (b)(6)(A) did modify previously existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.197" offset="619618">Before the subsection was enacted, respondent's claims would fail only if the challenged harvesting satisfied each of five old provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.469" offset="660683">Under Subsection (b)(6)(A) however, these same claims would fail if the harvesting satisfied Subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5) to new and different provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.978" offset="710733">Moreover, we find nothing in Subsection (b)(6)(A) that purported to direct any particular finding of fact or application of law to fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.248" offset="747827">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
