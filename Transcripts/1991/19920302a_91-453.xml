            <text syncTime="1736.088" offset="7089019">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.813" offset="7123919">South Carolina asks you to uphold the decision of our supreme court for what we believe to be two very compelling reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.926" offset="7160386">First is that the restrictions of the South Carolina Beach Front Management Act are based upon a very real and considered truth, and that is building upon unstable land, unstable beaches, the fragile beach dune system creates great public risk of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.251" offset="7245650">Secondly, the Petitioner never challenged that legislative determination, but instead claimed it was irrelevant to his takings claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.098" offset="7285042">His theory of the case is based upon the extreme proposition that economic impact alone, without any other consideration, is a determinant of taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.796" offset="7335824">The theory is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.587" offset="7343034">There is no constitutional right to harm others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.100" offset="7357036">Secondly, the threat is well documented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.893" offset="7372291">Building on an unstable and fragile beach dune system does create harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.307" offset="7393921">Well, if you say there is no constitutional right to harm others and link it to your argument... what about Justice Holmes' opinion in Mann against Pennsylvania Coal Company, where there was no question that the sub-surface mining would very likely to cause the subsidence of some residences, and yet the Court said that the compensation had to be paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1832.923" offset="7476363">I think what Justice Holmes was looking at was the balance between the degree of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.796" offset="7499873">There was very little public harm, in his way of thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.986" offset="7512621">It was a private harm that he was discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.229" offset="7525578">And in that instance, in that particular instance, the degree of diminution in value was very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.323" offset="7549924">I think in looking at the harm, what the Court does is to look at the degree of the harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.627" offset="7567165">Well, but don't you think then your proposition that there is no right to harm others in support of your idea of the nuisance exception is perhaps too broad, that sometimes there will be some actions of property owners that may cause some sort of harm to others and yet, perhaps they may not be totally proscribed without paying compensation?</text>

            <text syncTime="1879.722" offset="7663609">I think that this goes back to what has been termed the Mugler principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.684" offset="7679387">The community has authority to prevent serious public harm by denying uses without being required to pay compensation, but certainly it is a measure of the degree of harm that the State is seeking to prevent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1901.176" offset="7749395">Mr. Lewis takes the position, it doesn't matter how much harm, you have to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.178" offset="7765382">And as I read the South Carolina supreme court, it seems to say, it doesn't matter how little harm, you don't have to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.834" offset="7795997">Isn't that a fair description of what the South Carolina supreme court said?</text>

            <text syncTime="1933.648" offset="7879276">One is they first said that the Petitioner never raised the issue, that all he raised was the unique argument that diminution in value alone equaled to a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.517" offset="7922743">But secondly, I think that the legislative findings and facts that are laid out in the act gave the court reason, and sufficient reason to believe that there were great public harms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.005" offset="7972690">If you read the findings and purposes of the act, clearly they're directed at the highest type of police power activity, that is preventing threat to life and property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.173" offset="8021382">No, sir, it does not say that, but I think that that has been the position taken by the solicitor general and by this Court, that if there is a great threat to life and property, that certainly would fit within the commonly called nuisance exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.562" offset="8086897">And in essence the nuisance exception, it seems to me to be a shorthand way of saying, the State has the permission or the authority to prevent great public harm without paying compensation depend upon that degree.</text>
