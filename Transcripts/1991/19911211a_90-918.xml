            <text syncTime="10.777" offset="182124">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.745" offset="189961">In 1972 Congress enacted title IX to give all individuals a right not to be discriminated against on the ground of sex by educational institutions receiving Federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.740" offset="241996">In 1979 this Court held in Cannon that the title IX right is judicially enforceable at the behest of an individual like petitioner whose right has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.798" offset="286196">In the case presented today the question is whether the means of redressing the violation of this legally enforceable right include the normal remedy of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.529" offset="321095">We believe damages are available here for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.450" offset="336873">First, this Court's consistent rule has been to permit all traditional judicial remedies, including damages, whenever a statute contains an implied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.274" offset="384103">That's a perfectly sensible rule, I would submit, because when the Court concludes, as it did in Cannon, that there are sufficient indicia of congressional intent to support an implied right of action, the natural inference, and indeed the only plausible rule, is that the courts can use their customary remedial powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.889" offset="458604">Second, we believe that a direct examination of congressional intent confirms the conclusion that damages are available under title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.558" offset="493294">In 1972, when Congress expressly patterned title IX on title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, title VI had been interpreted by the lower courts to include an implied right of action, and this Court's cases at that time made it absolutely clear that an implied right of action carries with it a right to pursue damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.033" offset="595172">I think it is fair to say that Congress can properly be said to have relied on these subtle principles when it enacted title IX, and that that intent should be given effect here.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.294" offset="640207">Furthermore, after Cannon was decided it seems that this view of congressional intent became much clearer, as Congress has since then passed two statutes relying on and endorsing its understanding that damages are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.037" offset="707185">There's been no reason given to suggest why these long-settled and relied-on expectations should now be disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.798" offset="742189">I'd like to return, then, to the general rule which authorizes damages under an implied right of action unless there is good evidence to suggest that Congress intends otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.060" offset="787224">That rule has been consistently applied by this Court both before and after title IX was passed, including well into the era when the Court tightened up its criteria for implying a right of action in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.163" offset="847724">In particular, in 1983 and 1984 the Court applied this rule in the Guardians and Darrone cases to hold that a back-pay remedy is available under both title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.764" offset="3258094">I think there are several... several reasons to come to that conclusion, Justice Souter, and I think they are quite strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.527" offset="3285157">First of all, of course, Atascadero itself was a case involving compensatory damages and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.430" offset="3316713">Second of all, if you're only talking about an injunctive remedy it seems there'd be no reason to possibly abrogate the Eleventh Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.610" offset="3381497">And then I think, to address that question specifically, the legislative history and particularly this is a statute that was introduced on the floor, an amendment introduced on the floor and Senator Cranston introduced it.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.451" offset="3428831">And he flatly states that the purpose of this is to allow all the remedies, including damages, which we have always intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.541" offset="3461223">And so I think the clear consistent view is that.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.727" offset="3477941">And let me suggest there's another at least inferential reason, Justice Souter, and aside from the direct evidence, which is frankly not quoted in my brief but quoted in the brief by the civil rights groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.207" offset="3523812">But the other reason to infer that is in 1984 this Court hadn't simply upheld back pay under Darrone.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.765" offset="3558085">It also said in Smith v. Robinson that the lower courts generally agree that damages are available under 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.621" offset="3589536">So against the legal climate that Congress was arguing in, I think there's every reason to think it assumed, as the Court had indicated, that damages and back pay were available, once directly, once indirectly.</text>

            <text syncTime="883.238" offset="3671978">I would like to move back and talk first about 1972 and then about post-Cannon congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.735" offset="3705938">I think they're consistent, but I think there's one difference that becomes important.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.857" offset="3718476">Now, first of all, I think, without trying to re-argue the Cannon case, I think one or two key points bear emphasizing, and that is in 1972 when Congress enacted title IX there is no dispute it mirrored it on title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.928" offset="3806770">It was essentially an analog that substituted sex for race.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.770" offset="3822130">Now, title VI... two things had happened, however, that were key between '64 and '72.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.830" offset="3846372">Title VI had been consistently and frequently interpreted by the lower courts to provide a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.953" offset="3870823">Now, no lower court suggested a limitation on remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.389" offset="3888586">None.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.294" offset="3892243">At the same time between '64 and '72, this Court's cases uniformly made clear that a private, an implied right of action means a right to damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.399" offset="3940622">That's what the jurisprudence was.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.024" offset="3947100">The Court had never uncoupled the notion of an implied right of action from damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.273" offset="3972073">And in the case that must be most relevant, in Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, the Court concluded that an 1866 Civil Rights Act included an implied remedy for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.471" offset="4016899">So it seems to me under conventional principles still applied by this Court that title IX basically has to be read as incorporating that congressional understanding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.879" offset="4154512">What the Court had adopted in Borak, in Sullivan, in several other cases in this era, was if a statute indicates an intent to protect rights we will take that intent and the courts will fully enforce them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.761" offset="4246045">And the rule is, what the Court in Sullivan flatly states, is when there is a cause of action we will make available all remedies to effectuate it, and that was an implied cause of action case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.866" offset="4294529">1982, of course, doesn't contain an express cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.551" offset="4309262">So I think the law was really very settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.769" offset="4322114">Now I realize that today the law is different with respect to when you might imply a right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.408" offset="4348654">But I'm looking at Congress' intent in 1972, and I would submit to the Court that the two principles, that title VI had a private right and that a private right had never been uncoupled from a damages remedy by this Court, were clear at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.838" offset="4406333">Then I think, and in fact I think the Court in Cannon itself relied on those cases expressly in reaching the conclusion that there was an implied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.069" offset="4447293">But then I think we should look at post-1979, because it seems to me that whatever doubt Congress might have had about the scope of the remedies under title IX was cleared up in 1979 when Cannon came down because the Court then said yes, you do have a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.343" offset="4520436">And in 1979 there had never been a case in this Court that had uncoupled a private right of action from a damages remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.652" offset="4549588">And I suggest that Congress has taken two actions since then that supports their understanding that damages are available and as well the view that they endorse that understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.663" offset="4597654">One is the discussion I had with Justice Souter a few moments ago about the Atascadero statute, the Remedies Equalization Act which I think is fairly read, particularly in light of its legislative history, to support damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.330" offset="4648331">And second, only last year in the Americans with Disabilities Act which Congress passed it extended section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.202" offset="4683858">Now, 504, just like title IX, is based on title VI, and this Court has held that the three statutes in terms of their remedial schemes are read in parry material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.337" offset="4728370">And what the Court held, what Congress did under 504 is to say... under the Americans with Disabilities, pardon me, is to say look, we are now applying a right to programs that don't get Federal monies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.142" offset="4791587">That is 504 said if you get Federal monies and discriminate on handicap, you're not allowed to discriminate on handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.843" offset="4818441">Then Congress says we're going to extend that to State and local programs that do not receive Federal monies, and in extending it it says we intend to extend the damages remedy that has been recognized under section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.681" offset="4881761">And I suggest to you again that that intent reflects a consistent understanding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1252.669" offset="5149673">So it seems to me that we now have a 20-year relationship, basically from '72 to the present, where the Court and Congress have interacted in a way that indicates at least now that damages are under... available under title IX, and I don't think there is any good reason to undo that understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.442" offset="5228772">I would suggest that the contrary is actually true because in Cannon the case is almost unique in that this Court announced to Congress that it would apply the legal standards applicable in 1972 to title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.156" offset="5287600">That's what it said, and indeed I think it went on to suggest, at least in the concurring opinion, that in the future Congress ought to understand that new rules will govern new statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.027" offset="5331172">But that's a very different thing from saying that than telling Congress the 1970 rules apply to the context of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.835" offset="5362414">Now, despite that clear direction to Congress, the Solicitor General and the United States... and the respondent, want to argue here that the Court should apply a completely new view of interpreting title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.549" offset="5417167">I would say in response that that... that position is not only unfair given the history we have discussed, but it also quite frankly is wrong under modern standards of applied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.715" offset="5465859">That is to say I think it is fairly concluded based on Thompson v. Thompson that all nine members of the Court reaffirmed a view that Cannon's conclusion that Congress intended a private right of action, that that conclusion was supportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.146" offset="5531583">In the view of two justices that was based upon the narrower title VI incorporation theory I discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.986" offset="5562930">Only then did Justice Scalia, in a separate, in a separate concurring opinion, say he would move the law further and would eliminate implied rights of action altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.138" offset="5607547">Under that view I recognize we would not be in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.559" offset="5625206">However, Justice Scalia said that's not the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.152" offset="5635655">And he further said if it were to become the law it would have to be applied only prospectively to new statutes when Congress understood what the rules of the game then were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.631" offset="5681526">If there are no further questions I'll reserve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.627" offset="5721546">Our view of the case is that the law as it stands now has developed through the sequence of cases, Cannon, Guardians, and Darrone, to a point where at the most under title IX and similar conditional spending power statutes the relief that would be judicially available would be equitable in nature and nothing beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.507" offset="5833036">We feel that this line between equitable and traditional damages remedies is a rational stopping point in the development of the law, and we would suggest that if... within the context of this case, the Court hold that nothing more than equitable relief be available in the context of a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.262" offset="5940034">We think that the cases of this Court state the criteria for determining implied cause of action, and we argue also for remedy is governed by congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.738" offset="6005967">And under that method of analysis our view is no reading of the statute, no reading of the cases of this Court up until now, particularly under conditional spending power legislation, would authorize anything more than equitable relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1529.636" offset="6257578">The first is that the agency responsible for enforcing title IX, the Office of Civil Rights, was called into the process, and the agency in the statute does have a role in trying to achieve voluntary compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.835" offset="6318392">That language is used in the statute and that is a predicate to the use of the agency remedy of funding termination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.018" offset="6815136">That's the focus of title IX, that's the focus of agency oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.984" offset="6826943">And in the event that agency oversight doesn't produce sufficient correctives, Cannon allows the student to go into court and says... say OCR, school system, they've gotten together, they haven't done enough, I disagree, will you do more.</text>

            <text syncTime="1694.164" offset="6915655">But, I think the advantage of the title IX compliance mechanisms is that you have some way of resolving the issue of whether there has been a violation and what corrective measures need to be taken, and can obviate the necessity of litigation if you can find the remedy to equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.231" offset="7003949">Bear in mind that if you have a damages remedy it's never moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.998" offset="7774979">In effect what he wants is a damage action against the institution under a statute which provides no remedy against the wrongdoers as individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.306" offset="7816253">If you're talking about inverting priorities in terms of morals, at least 1983 provides a remedy directly against the individual wrongdoer, and there is a special, more particularized showing that has to be made in order to impute liability up to the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.612" offset="7889500">I think the inversion comes in their interpretation of title IX and the identity of the defendant, and then you look at who the wrongdoer is directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.374" offset="7936521">And that would be, under their allegations in the case, the individuals who were involved with this student.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.494" offset="7965046">So I would disagree with you in the suggestion that we're inverting classical law equity relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.148" offset="7995662">Suits against governmental entities have always been treated differently because remedies at law are inadequate and therefore equitable relief has been necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.972" offset="8034950">Ex parte Young fiction was the origin of that in modern litigation, and it is carried all the way forward into the contemporary era, and in fact lots of statutes view this, I would assume, as being such a strongly held principle that they exempted local subdivisions from the scope of their laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.024" offset="8127110">Title VII, for example, was... did not cover State and local political subdivisions until it was modified in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.333" offset="8164308">So we feel like that if you look at the contemporary context within which title IX was enacted and at statutory antecedent, title VI, the basic law was no damages remedies against governmental defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.046" offset="8227211">The structure of the Civil Rights Act of '64 is totally consistent with that premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.388" offset="8252602">Injunctive relief... where legal relief is available under that statute, every title, every one, nothing more than equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.055" offset="8299205">Every title deals with intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.834" offset="8318326">And the conjunction of title VI with those other titles, it seems to me, argues powerfully that what was contemplated under title VI was injunctive relief, and the law that was being assimilated in title IX was injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.904" offset="8406620">Look at the title VI litigation between 1964 and 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.167" offset="8431698">I tried to cite as many of the cases as I could find in my appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.243" offset="8444027">Not one case did we find where the litigants even asked for any remedy other than injunctive relief, except for the few cases that drew in the analogy of the title VI equitable relief model.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.361" offset="8504423">And some of these cases are cases where the 1983 claim was a parallel claim, where you have a damages remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.750" offset="8533993">Nobody asked for conventional damages, and surely nobody asked for punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.716" offset="8557921">It seems to me when you look at these kinds of factors the case is compelling that neither title VI, title IX, or any similar legislation has ever contemplated the sort of damages remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.943" offset="8622810">We ask, then, that the Court affirm the ruling of the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.878" offset="8654574">If there are no further questions, the Solicitor General has time allocated in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text syncTime="2138.250" offset="8691982">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.697" offset="8745794">The governing principle in this area, we submit, is that petitioner is entitled to pursue only those remedies that Congress has authorized, and in determining what Congress has intended we further submit that there is no factual or theoretical basis for presuming that Congress approaches statutory remedies on an all-or-nothing basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.624" offset="8841507">In other words that it... when it sets out to create a private remedy it conceives of remedies in units called causes of action and delegates to courts the authority to fill out those causes of action in whatever manner courts consider appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.103" offset="8915485">Indeed in the context relevant to this case, experience suggests precisely the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.286" offset="8940145">There is no dispute that title IX was patterned after title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.955" offset="8970865">None of the titles, none of the private rights of action created in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provided for traditional legal damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.107" offset="9011407">Title VII provided for an expressed right of action for equitable remedies including back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.589" offset="9041396">Title II provided for preventive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.118" offset="9059472">Two other titles reserved whatever remedies were available from other sources but created no private remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.100" offset="9087371">And indeed the most aggressive advocates of private remedies in 1964 in the context of title VI suggested only a provision that would have authorized private parties to seek preventive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.109" offset="9147453">Justice Scalia, I submit that there is no basis for believing that Congress in this area conceives of the traditional legal remedy of damages as being the remedy of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.495" offset="9205027">The experience suggests that Congress has thought of equitable relief as the more likely remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.882" offset="9238568">The Court has also abandoned, in the context of statutory remedies, the presumption that a grant of subject matter jurisdiction authorizes the courts to grant whatever remedies courts may consider appropriate to vindicate rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.905" offset="9314636">In Davis v. Passman the Court made clear that that... that it will continue general Federal subject matter jurisdiction as a basis for conferring remedies with respect to violations of constitutional rights, but it has made clear that at the same time that with respect to statutes the touchstone must be congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.989" offset="9410976">Indeed within a period of weeks after Davis v. Passman the Court issued its opinion in Touche Ross and Redington, indicating that the question of remedies is one of statutory interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.355" offset="9512436">That is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.885" offset="9518601">In Davis v. Passman the Court said as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.243" offset="9531975">We're... the petitioner suggests that title IX should be construed with respect to precedents preceding its enactment in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.081" offset="9591325">I have a couple of points with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.860" offset="9606476">First of all, in Allen v. State Board of Elections, which is a case predating 1972, the Court did recognize a private right of action limited to declaratory... declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.729" offset="9669902">There was, to be sure, no request for damages in that case, but it cannot fairly be said, I think, that the Court has never considered the possibility, even before 1972, that damages necessarily accompanied any private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.083" offset="9735312">Secondly, last term in the Virginia Bankshares case, the Court indicated very clearly that although it would not overrule previously recognized causes of action, that in determining their scope and in rounding them out, if you will, it would refer to the principles that have informed its decisions in recent times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.010" offset="9835100">In that case it was dealing with a cause of action recognized in the Borak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.242" offset="9855998">Rather than take... than consider principles that might have been in Congress' contemplation in the 1930's, it analyzed the case from the standpoint of its current jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.861" offset="9918483">Again, I think the... I'd like to turn briefly to petitioner's reliance on the post-title IX statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.683" offset="9973758">I don't believe there is any suggestion that the private right of action that petitioner seeks was created at any time after 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.945" offset="10018793">The issue before the Court, in other words, is what Congress intended in 1972 when it enacted title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.254" offset="10052021">The 1986 congressional action on its face doesn't tell us very much about what the 1972 Congress itself meant, and therefore we believe that it should not displace the Court's consideration and the materials that were determinative as of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.168" offset="10131642">Beyond that, on its face the text of the 19... 1986 act only says that remedies, including actions at equity and at law, will be available from State entities to the same extent as they would be applicable from private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.847" offset="10210427">The goal was to equalize remedies, whatever they might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.893" offset="10226623">The statute on its face does not recognize any particular remedy against any particular defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2543.524" offset="10313141">Our position is that the same remedies are available from all defendants under title IX, and they are limited to equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.677" offset="10345742">The... there is further the suggestion that there has been a unanimous judicial view that damages are recoverable under funding statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.061" offset="10411257">In truth there has not been anything of the sort that would justify the Court in assuming that Congress in 1986, or more recently when it passed the other statute on which my opponent relies, was ratifying a consensus here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.647" offset="10485654">Our brief at the petition stage sets forth the rather sharp division among the courts on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.254" offset="10516060">After this Court's decision in Cannon, the Seventh Circuit held that damages were unavailable under title IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.767" offset="10542078">There was a split among the circuits under the Handicap Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.922" offset="10558692">And in considering those cases the Court should also be aware that a number of them were decided under the Education for All Handicapped Act and sought sums that in the school committee of Burlington in this case this Court said were not damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.164" offset="10631730">So that in... casual references in many Handicapped Act cases to awards of damages we think should be taken carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.550" offset="10673213">There is at best a split among the courts under these three related statutes, title VI, title IX, and the Rehabilitation Act on the question whether damages, traditional legal damages, are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.295" offset="10732250">Finally, as a matter of policy and in the context of this statute as a whole there is no reason, we submit, to ascribe to Congress the view that legal damages are necessary for effective enforcement of this statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="2732.761" offset="11070065">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.087" offset="11075394">The first point I'd like to make is that respondent and the Solicitor General are here today asking the Court to legislate between back pay on the one hand and damages on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.113" offset="11123459">They think that it's a better means of enforcement to allow for back pay and not for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.283" offset="11144148">I submit to the Court there is nothing in what we have talked about today, in the legislative history, in the enactments, in this Court's decisions, that would make that distinction tenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.904" offset="11190646">And the Solicitor General significantly did not tell the Court what in the legislative history, what in the statute supports back pay and not damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.525" offset="11233174">The second point that I want to emphasize is that respondent's argument about money not being available against cities and States is flatly inconsistent with the back-pay remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.364" offset="11280507">All of these arguments about immunity cannot be squared with back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.612" offset="11297435">They apply equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.705" offset="11305794">Second of all in that regard, respondent tells us there was no back pay, there was no monetary remedies against States and cities during this era.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.874" offset="11338499">Then he says let's look at the cases from '64 to '72 under title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.903" offset="11358666">And what does he say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.216" offset="11363890">He said they all had 1983 actions, but he's just told us that 1983 doesn't provide damages or back pay against the cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.399" offset="11396596">So these title IX claims were the ones that provided for the monetary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.381" offset="11416553">Finally, I would submit, we have seen a fair amount of historical revisionism here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.565" offset="11441317">I asserted in my opening argument and I will stick by it, if you read the Court's precedents between '64 and '72, which I suggest is the critical period because that's when title VII, title VI, and title IX were passed, the one mirrored on the other, those cases say if you have an implied right of action you have damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.840" offset="11514356">The Solicitor General says look at the Allen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.573" offset="11525327">I welcome the opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.713" offset="11533895">Allen provides... Allen was a case involving enforcement of section V of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.415" offset="11556674">All that section V provides is for preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.599" offset="11569422">So the only possible remedy in that statute would be an order declaring or enjoining the preclearance of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.752" offset="11605993">There could not have been damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.408" offset="11612681">The other cases that I discussed uniformly accept damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.281" offset="11632116">Finally, during the period '68... during the period 1964 to 1972... again, the crucible I think we want to look at for '72 intent... not only had Congress passed the Fair Housing Act, which included expressly a damages... which included a damages remedy expressly under civil rights enforcement, not only had this Court come down with Little Hunting Park, Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, which included a damages remedy under another civil rights statute, but in addition to those events the key point is that the notion that this would be an effective statute, Justice Stevens, without damages for students is an untenable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.966" offset="11810898">And the reason I say that is, look, what does respondent and the Solicitor General say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.402" offset="11824586">Here we have a statute that applies to schools, and they say you can get back pay under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.697" offset="11845797">But who are the beneficiaries, the primary beneficiaries?</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.493" offset="11856978">They are obviously students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.413" offset="11864710">That's what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.867" offset="11870457">And for students back pay is useless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.491" offset="11881010">Now, to be sure, any remedy can be mooted out, as respondent suggests, if you give people what they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.769" offset="11906088">And if they gave our client the damages she is entitled to we wouldn't go to court either, but it is strange to think that Congress would have implied a remedy for back pay and not for damages under a statute where back pay is meaningless for most people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3028.204" offset="12251845">What I suggest to you is that Congress in the legislative history indicated that it understood and intended those remedies to include damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3053.443" offset="12352782">And the final distinction, if I might before I sit down, is let's look at the difference between a statute like title VII on the one hand and the Fair Housing Act and title IX on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.517" offset="12397085">For most employees back pay is going to be a meaningful remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3082.150" offset="12467616">Because in the Fair Housing context, by the time you get an injunction, it's too late.</text>
