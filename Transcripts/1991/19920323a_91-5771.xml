            <text syncTime="2598.176" offset="10534542">So that your question really is a hypothetical one and it should not happen in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.319" offset="10555126">It was mentioned that this sort of question, if reviewed by courts, would require them to get into factors that really are not suitable for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.585" offset="10600161">They'd have to balance the deterrent value of going ahead and sentencing a convicted defendant to at least the minimum sentence proscribed by law, against the potential benefit of encouraging other defendants to cooperate with the Government... which we think is the whole purpose of these substantial assistance provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.078" offset="10678111">And that sort of judgment will often turn on the Government's enforcement priorities, and enforcement plan, as in the charging decision that this Court discussed in Wayte.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.273" offset="10722937">Review would also impose some very significant, systemic costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.977" offset="10741745">It would certainly delay proceedings; the deliberations of the U.S. Attorneys would be opened to outside inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.112" offset="10774241">And we think that the prosecutorial effectiveness might be undermined if the Government's enforcement policies were revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.738" offset="10800782">If defendants knew exactly how much cooperation they had to supply in order to come within some standards, they would probably do the minimum, and not give all the cooperation that they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.257" offset="10850832">We think it's clear that defendants would seek extensive discovery... not just about their own case, but about other cases... because they'd want to make comparisons; they would want the prosecutor to explain, probably take the stand... if they could get him to do it... and explain the basis for the decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2758.999" offset="11177781">And we think that's so because they are things that the defendant really has control over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.603" offset="11196275">The defendant controls whether he obstructs justice, or whether he took a minor role in the offense or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.425" offset="11219577">And we think they also go to the defendant's level of culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.529" offset="11235982">We think substantial assistance is really different in a basic way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.644" offset="11256357">The defendant may be very willing to help, and wants to do all he can for the Government, truly sorry for his offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.151" offset="11314453">In fact, the sentencing commission amended 5K1.1 in 1989 to make it clear that a good-faith effort is not good enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="2917.103" offset="11810258">And we think that's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.775" offset="11820915">This Court has recognized that defendants are not entitled to individualized sentencing outside the capital sentencing context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.022" offset="11865951">Petitioner was convicted in accordance with laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.574" offset="11876086">So we think he's eligible for any punishment that's authorized by the statute, as long as it's not cruel and unusual, or based on the kind of arbitrary distinction that would violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.231" offset="11982770">But let me just read from page 10 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.325" offset="12011087">This was the sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.358" offset="12019237">In fact, let me just back up for a minute, and point it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.731" offset="12032716">On page 8, petitioner was really making a very different argument to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.736" offset="12064795">If you look on page 8, at about the middle of the page, it says, my argument is that at section 5K2.0 of the guidelines... a different provision of the guidelines, which is the general provisions of departure... the court is allowed to take into consideration items and information and evidence, which, if it considers them not to have been treated, or if it considers them not to have been adequately taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.371" offset="12163329">And my argument to you is that the evidence in the pre-sentence report would indicate that there is a level of cooperation... and although the Government, in its wisdom, chose not to grant substantial assistance... they may not have been adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission, that this type of evidence might allow for a downward departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.734" offset="12240755">That's really a very different argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.516" offset="12247861">He helped so much in this case that the sentencing commission really couldn't have taken into account this level of assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.921" offset="12281506">And therefore, this goes beyond 5K1.1 and takes him into the realm of this other guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.223" offset="12306689">And the court, quite reasonably, responded well, maybe that's true or maybe it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.278" offset="12326960">But here we have a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.330" offset="12343155">You're not suggesting that I could go below a sentence established directly by Congress, are you?</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.514" offset="12367920">And the petitioner responded, well, I believe that you could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.968" offset="12385683">I do not... I'm now on page 9 of the joint appendix... I do not have a case to cite to you on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.931" offset="12405536">And that's the point where the court said well, I believe I'm going to let you make some law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.824" offset="12421105">Because I do not believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.113" offset="12426329">I do not believe I have that authority... addressing this other argument that petitioner made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.907" offset="12445451">And then, of course, the... on page 10 of the joint appendix, the part that we've already been over, the court did say, you may state for the record, in the event you desire to appeal, what the evidence would be, inviting petitioner to make a proffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.486" offset="12507727">And then he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.898" offset="12513474">He went on for several paragraphs proffering his evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.441" offset="12527580">He went exclusively to the help he'd given, the cooperation he'd given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.583" offset="12540119">And the court said, all right, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.265" offset="12550881">And petitioner's lawyer said, that would be our proffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.888" offset="12565405">So we think that petitioner has had a perfectly adequate full opportunity to present whatever his evidence would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.652" offset="12604484">And so a remand in this case is certainly not warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.746" offset="12620785">If there are no further questions, I thank the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.529" offset="12823913">Quite often... I would say, in fact, virtually every time... that type of situation occurs, the defendant is uncounseled, and is there on his own at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.131" offset="12962362">And additionally, in the record that the Court has, it notes when I was appointed to represent him, which was sometime after that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.409" offset="13007502">But in the record you will see where I was appointed, on October 30.</text>
