            <text syncTime="9.968" offset="192307">Mr. Geller.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="53.365" stopTime="265.983">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="53.365" offset="365864">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and maybe it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="59.329" offset="389792">Up until 1982, employees in the State of Michigan who reached retirement age with a job-related disability were entitled to collect workers' compensation benefits and retirement benefits, even though both workers' compensation benefits and retirement benefits were intended to compensate an employee of the same exact wage loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.725" offset="479340">In many cases this allowed retired employees to earn more money after retirement than they would have earned if they had continued to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.439" offset="510165">Now, needless to say, this so-called retiree problem was quite costly to employers and was considered by many government officials to be the single biggest liability to maintaining and attracting business to the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.759" offset="563454">The Michigan legislature responded to this problem in 1981 by passing a statute that authorized employers to coordinate workers' compensation benefits with various other benefits provided by employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.727" offset="619356">Under the 1981 statute, which became effective on March 31, 1982, employers were allowed to offset workers' compensation benefits against the amounts that an employee was otherwise receiving from employer-sponsored wage replacement programs, such as pensions and Social Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.430" offset="698142">Now a few years after the 1981 statute went into effect, the Michigan supreme court held in a case called Chambers... unanimously held that the coordination provisions applied to all payments of workers' compensation after March 31, 1982, regardless of when the employee happened to have been injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.982" offset="772329">The court reached this conclusion by relying on the plain language of the 1981 statute, the structure of the statute, and the legislative purpose in requiring coordination of benefits in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.300" offset="813603">Now, the Chambers decision was immediately attacked by employee groups in the State of Michigan, and efforts were made to overrule it legislatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.394" offset="850070">Almost 2 years later, in May of 1987, the Michigan legislature passed a statute abolishing coordination of workers' benefits for employees injured prior to March 31, 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.934" offset="904196">But the legislature was not content simply to abolish coordination of workers' compensation benefits prospectively; they went much further.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.779" offset="943588">The 1987 statute explicitly announced that the Michigan Supreme Court's decision in Chambers was erroneously decided, had erroneously interpreted the intent of 1981 legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.317" offset="985698">And to remedy this perceived error, what the Michigan legislature did in 1987 was to repeal the 1981 coordination provision retroactively and required employers to make refunds, with interest, to all employees whose benefits had been lawfully coordinated during the 5-year period that the 1981 statute had been in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.371" offset="1069916">Now, petitioners did not challenge the 1987 statute to the extent that it affected the amount of workers' compensation benefits payable prospectively; but they claimed that the retroactive provisions of the statute violated the contracts clause and the due process clause of the Federal Constitution to the extent that it required employers to go back and reassess their workers' compensation obligations for the years 1982 to 1987 under a completely different set of rules than were in effect during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.351" offset="1193841">The Michigan courts rejected these Federal constitutional claims, and we have renewed them in this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="307.190" offset="1381192">I think because the terms of the contract, we allege, Your Honor, are that employers will make workers' compensation benefits to disabled employees in whatever amount is lawful at the... during the period of time of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.541" offset="1434586">After all, the amounts that may be lawful will vary in the future based upon what the legislature determines in light of existing events.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.946" offset="1468232">The contract obligation is pay whatever the amount is that is lawful during every subsequent period of disability, and that was what we... what we assert was the contractual obligation and the contractual expectation.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.134" offset="1517028">Now, at the time that these employees became injured there was no coordination, but subsequently there was coordination, and the employers satisfied their contractual obligation by paying coordinated benefits during that period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="650.008" offset="2752516">Now respondents' briefs are full of statements suggesting that the Michigan legislature has frequently enacted retroactive laws in the workers' compensation area, and that this Court has frequently upheld such retroactive legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.067" offset="2804760">But all of the instances that they rely on, without exception, involve laws that were retroactive in the secondary sense of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.741" offset="2835376">In other words, the legislature had from time to time increased or altered the amount of workers' compensation benefits, payable prospectively, although it made those laws applicable to people who were... who had suffered preexisting disabilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="957.261" offset="3981525">And this Court has in the past disagreed with statements by State courts that things that look like contracts were not in fact contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.746" offset="4007438">Secondly, we don't have a reasoned decision of the Michigan Supreme Court explaining why this is not a contract, and in fact, its statement that this is not a contract is inconsistent with prior decisions of the Michigan Supreme Court in cases like McAvoy and Selk, which have said that the obligation of employers under the workers' compensation statute in Michigan is contractual.</text>

            <text syncTime="1534.182" offset="6289182">Now even if we are wrong in our contracts clause challenge, let me spend a few minutes on the due process clause, because the due process clause independently imposes substantial limits on the State's ability to retroactively enact civil legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.569" offset="6342680">And once important... once again, I think it's very important to distinguish between the two types of retroactive legislation mentioned earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.843" offset="6367863">There are many cases of this Court upholding legislation that was retroactive in the sense of imposing future legal consequences on past events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.749" offset="6403389">All of the cases that respondents rely on, such as Turner Elkhorn, fall in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.242" offset="6425436">But the Court has taken a quite different approach when dealing with statutes that are retroactive in this primary sense, statutes that change the law in the past, that changed the past legal consequences of past events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.831" offset="6471725">In that type of case, the Court has upheld retroactive statutes against the due process challenge in only two situations that we are aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.357" offset="6501923">Now, the first situation which usually arises in tax cases, is where Congress has imposed a short period of retroactivity to prevent people from rearranging their affairs to evade pending legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.712" offset="6551242">The Gray case is a good example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.385" offset="6558034">That's certainly not our case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.646" offset="6563049">We are not dealing with a short period of retroactivity to evade pending legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.318" offset="6577678">Now, the second type of case involves so-called curative legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.180" offset="6593143">The Court on several occasions has upheld retroactive statutes that cured inadvertent technical defects in prior legislation... the Heinszen case, for example, where there was a tariff in effect, but there was a technical defect in it, and Congress reenacted the tariff and made it retroactive to the date of the original tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.781" offset="6659598">There's no problem in that type of case because it doesn't destroy any reliance interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.465" offset="6678302">Such laws can't upset any settled expectations because they in fact reaffirm what everyone always thought to be the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.287" offset="6705574">On the other hand, this Court has said that retroactive laws that represent changes in legislative policy can't be imposed retroactively because of the fundamental unfairness of imposing new rules of conduct on people who've had... who've engaged in past completed transactions under different rules of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.231" offset="6781329">And the classic case for this type of retroactive legislation is the Forbes Pioneer case, where the case tried to enact a toll and make it retroactive 4 years to a time when a ship had passed through the canal thinking that there was no toll.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.730" offset="6835350">Now, with these as the relevant categories, we think it's easy to see where the 1987 statute falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.106" offset="6856875">The State of Michigan in its brief concedes the 1987 statute was plainly just a change in legislative policy, was not a curative law intended to remedy an inadvertent defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.261" offset="6897521">It changed the law during a 5-year period of the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.353" offset="6909851">There were many, many settled transactions during that 5-year people that were completely upset--</text>

            <text syncTime="1747.432" offset="7142132">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.295" offset="7153626">The appeal to the contract clause is an extraordinary one, particularly in that it does not avail the petitioners at all, and I think it's important to get the facts and history straight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.964" offset="7204303">Mr. Romein and Mr. Gonzalez, like other employees or former employees similarly situated, had worked for decades for these employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.881" offset="7251951">During the entire time of their employment and other similarly situated employees the Michigan workers' compensation statute forbade, expressly prohibited any kinds of setoffs or coordination, as it is currently called.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.722" offset="7327288">These respondents, Mr. Romein and Mr. Gonzalez, worked through their course of employment until Mr. Romein was disabled in 1977 in serious injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.002" offset="7388414">I misspoke myself, Mr. Romein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.854" offset="7399908">Mr. Gonzalez was disabled from silicosis in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.017" offset="7416522">Through all of these decades until the moment they were injured and became disabled Michigan law expressly prohibited any kind of setoff or coordination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.505" offset="7462498">During this time, moreover, contrary to petitioners' statements, there was not a statement under Michigan law that there was a contract of any variety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.812" offset="7499696">There are several Michigan cases, they are cited in our brief, in which the court said precisely the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.967" offset="7524356">And indeed, ironically, when General Motors argued to the Michigan Supreme Court in the Chambers case, it made precisely the argument that Michigan did not respect workers' compensation as an aspect of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.037" offset="7580571">And we have appended the General Motors' brief in the Chambers case as appendix A to our own brief here, showing that General Motors's position at that time was diametrically opposite to the position asserted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.764" offset="7627487">The Michigan Supreme Court had never... I'm about to overstate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.778" offset="7655595">Prior to 1943 the Michigan statute was elective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.512" offset="7674507">After that time it was compulsory and then in the recent cases of the court, the court recognized that it was compulsory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.555" offset="7702615">Employers had no options to modify this law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.029" offset="7716512">They could not agree to any changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.969" offset="7724349">They could not vary anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.431" offset="7730200">There was no right of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.271" offset="7737515">There was no mutual assent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.442" offset="7742217">There was no knowledge required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.003" offset="7748486">And with respect to the characterization by the way that this was at-ill contract insofar as these employees are concerned, that was, of course, not the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.704" offset="7935209">And accordingly when the 1981 amendments occurred, these were no longer employees who would have had any employment contract into which to incorporated the workers' compensation, quotes, "contract".</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.097" offset="8132800">The courts... the Michigan court has rejected generally the notion that there is any kind of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.681" offset="8155160">It certainly therefore did not upset... accept a subset, a promise where there is no promise at all that employers will be obligated to accept anything that comes down the pike in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.607" offset="8198837">That's the last thing in the world the legislature would have intended or that employers would have been agreeable to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.591" offset="8222765">So that when in 1981 the, quotes, "coordination" was agreed to as a part of a general accommodation of values by the legislature and policy judgments are made on the one hand to increase workers' compensation benefits prospectively, in part to be financed through the resources of the coordination, but dealing only with future injuries, that is a determination made in the legitimate policy judgment of the Michigan legislature, not as a matter of contract, but obviously in the exercise of its police powers regulating the workplace in this important area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.995" offset="8368424">This Court recognized in 1917 that this was the legitimate exercise of police powers of the State to protect the serious interests that are involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.387" offset="8562044">What happened when the judgments and accommodations were made in 1980 and 1981, contrary to the suggestion of counsel, was not that there was any fat increase of benefits for the workers who were already retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.768" offset="8623484">There was a nominal so-called supplemental increase, payable by the State, not by employers, which by case law has been generally inapplicable to virtually everybody who might otherwise be affected and is insignificant in its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.527" offset="8674579">But let's take the history a little further so we get this factual context straight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.841" offset="8691820">What happened was in 1982, when General Motors and Ford, apparently alone, took on this aggressive posture of trying to interpret the statutory amendments as other employers were not doing, including their competitor Chrysler, to say that this was retrospective as to people who were injured prior to 1981, the legislature responded with resolutions which said that it was never the intention of this legislation to deal retroactively as to these people who were previously injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.963" offset="8836329">And I do not recall the history that counsel recites that there was a failure in the legislature to enact new legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.606" offset="8858899">There was no reason for the legislature to enact new legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.169" offset="8873110">They enacted the resolutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.102" offset="8880842">Then, throughout the entire administrative process which followed, throughout the entire lower court judicial process that followed, the position of General Motors and Ford were consistently and universally rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.860" offset="8935908">It was not until the Michigan Supreme Court spoke in 1985 that General Motors prevailed and it prevailed again, on arguments diametrically opposed to the arguments which are being made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.079" offset="8992751">There was immediate revulsion, and I don't think that's an overstatement, to the decision that the court had reached because it was--</text>

            <text syncTime="2220.726" offset="9035383">--On the part, I think, of people generally, certainly on the part of the legislature, on the part of the former Governor who had sponsored the coordination proposition in the first place, the administrative officers who had administered it and had sponsored it as well, as far as the public generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.527" offset="9102569">And indeed, the author of the opinion in Chambers concluded within weeks, following on a motion for rehearing, that the methodology of the court was wrong and that she had erred and she acknowledged harsh and unforeseen circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.389" offset="9174040">This is part of the decision in the Chambers case in terms of what was then a denial of rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.304" offset="9197655">Now contrary to the suggestion that there is a 2-year period as I heard counsel say, what immediately happened was that it within weeks, there was legislation which was introduced into the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.421" offset="9246138">By January of 1986, within 4 or 5 weeks after the introduction of that legislation, it had passed the house of representatives in Michigan, which did exactly what the law ultimately enacted did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.337" offset="9289815">So... and what was involved there, counsel decries understandably the retroactivity, but what the legislature was seeking to correct was retroactivity, because this was the first time in some 75 years in the history of the Michigan statute that there ever had been a cutback in workers' benefits, whether retroactively or prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.794" offset="9387618">He errs, with all respect, when he says there has not been... there had not been, rather... retroactive legislation or amendments to the workers' comp act affecting employers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.782" offset="10115598">More pertinently to the present circumstances, the reason why the action was taken here and had in the legislative judgment, which I suggest is the dispositive fact, had to be taken here was that this was the first time in 75 years where the legislature, at least as construed in the opinion in the legislature, misconstrued by the Michigan Supreme Court, had reduced benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.940" offset="10224163">And the only way that could be dealt with if it was going to be rectified was responding to the particular action which had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.404" offset="10254047">What I was starting to say earlier, Justice Kennedy, was that section 831 of the act, which existed through all of this period, said that, quotes,</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.754" offset="10307441">"Neither the payment of compensation or the accepting of the same by the employee or his dependents shall be considered as a determination of the rights of the parties under this act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.129" offset="10344953">So that there could be no claim of reliance, the act expressly foreclosed that possibility because payment itself or the receipt of benefits was nondeterminative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.745" offset="10383405">If I may, I want to zero in on the extraordinary proposition that's urged by General Motors and Ford, under contract clause theory they say, that what the Michigan legislature has said not only is workers' compensation a contract when the Michigan law is quite to the contrary, but also it's a contract which accepts anything that occurs down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.012" offset="10480476">That I would suggest, reduces the contract clause claim to utter incoherence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.997" offset="10508480">The theory of... the original brief's theory was that there was a contract clause claim because it's supposed to incorporate all of this other external law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.234" offset="10553410">But that is the existing external law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.805" offset="10563650">One doesn't incorporate law that comes down later and make a contract claim theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.049" offset="10584653">Then in turn, when these injured workers ceased to be employees there is no employment contract into which to incorporate their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.016" offset="10624463">And if, then, the claim is that the contractual theory is that we accept anything that comes down later, that reduces us all to nonsense because ultimately what they are saying is, as phrased in your question, Justice Scalia, the last enactment is what the employer has promised long ago to abide by.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.890" offset="10715996">Well, that hardly is the notion or concept or purpose of the contract clause, which is supposed to, in petitioners' view and at least in the history, to give some confidence in terms of reliance and expectation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.340" offset="10769809">There is no expectation; these petitioners can hardly claim to be able to plan their affairs if they are going to be vulnerable to whatever the Michigan legislature does much later.</text>

            <text syncTime="3283.999" offset="13288431">So there could have been no claim of reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.300" offset="13297626">They knew as well that all of their competitors, that the rest of industry and others, interpret it differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.167" offset="13329077">So they... whatever view they were asserting was a controversial view and not based on any expression by the highest court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.122" offset="13360947">The decision to which Your Honor relates again, only came at the end of 1985, some 16 months before the new legislation was adopted and only a few weeks before the house spoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.920" offset="13416117">So there was never a period when General Motors and Ford had any legitimate reason to believe that this matter was final until the legislature indeed finally spoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.048" offset="13460630">Prior to December 1985, this was a matter that was highly contested, with every authority dealing with the matter rejecting their view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.943" offset="13500232">Afterward, the legislature in one house had spoken, the matter was in ferment, and finally the legislators... the legislature spoke, with the Michigan Supreme Court concluding that they had the authority to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.792" offset="13547565">This is, in the final analysis, a matter of State determination, the exercise of its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.528" offset="13578599">Counsel began by talking about whether the legislature originally had authority to reach this accommodation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.802" offset="13599601">Of course it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.930" offset="13604199">It could have concluded that there should be offset, it could have concluded, as it had for decades before, there should not be offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.829" offset="13639725">It made that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.867" offset="13643905">It made that judgment in the exercise of its police powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.902" offset="13660101">Counsel points to workers' comp, but under the theory of contract which they urge, they would have to, in quotes,</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.045" offset="13688627">"incorporate OSHA laws, EEO laws, labor laws, minimum wage laws, ordinary labor laws. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.983" offset="13728333">There is no law which effects the workplace which under their theory would not be incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.197" offset="13753201">And where does that lead?</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.746" offset="13759471">That, under a contract theory, under their theory, there is absolutely no distinction between contract and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.843" offset="13791863">That's not the law of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.313" offset="13797714">It's not the law of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.795" offset="13803670">It has not been the law anywhere, and there is no justification for that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.476" offset="13818298">For those reasons, unless the Court has questions, I would conclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.180" offset="13837211">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="3425.882" offset="13856019">Just a few things, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.454" offset="13866259">To begin with, Mr. Sachs claims that he is unaware of the fact that the legislature in 1982 defeated a bill that would have made the 1981 statute applicable only to people injured after 1982, but I would refer the Court to page 43-A to the appendix to the petition, footnote 24, where that... the defeat of that bill is mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.398" offset="13945985">Secondly, Mr. Sachs spent almost none of his time on the due process clause today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.910" offset="13964062">The Chief Justice asked him about the Forbes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.392" offset="13973988">What he said about the Forbes case is that this Court held that statute unconstitutional because it was not rational, but it was plainly rational to require people to pay for passage through a canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.058" offset="14012649">Why should they get... why should they go through a canal for free?</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.761" offset="14023516">The statute was struck down, not because it wasn't rational to charge people for going through a canal, but because the statute completely destroyed reliance interests of people who had gone through the canal thinking that it was toll free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.477" offset="14066357">That's why it was struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.528" offset="14070537">And the basic notion of due process is fundamental fairness and one of the basic notions of fundamental fairness is notice, and that's what we are arguing for here today.</text>
