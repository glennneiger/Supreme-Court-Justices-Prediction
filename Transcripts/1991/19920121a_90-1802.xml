            <text syncTime="94.263" offset="514687">Justice White, I know you have been here, because you were a member of the Court which decided United Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.479" offset="543526">This is a revisitation in an ERISA context of identical issues which have already been decided in favor of the position which both Nationwide and the Government assert today.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.407" offset="599219">The background of history is that Congress enacted both the National Labor Relations Act and the Social Security Act by making them applicable to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.906" offset="641224">And by using that word, standing alone, without more, as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.610" offset="664108">And in the forties, this Court, in Hearst and Silk and Bartels, decided that it would conceive a definition of the word employee different from that which Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.158" offset="722308">And Congress repudiated those three decisions and asserted what the Senate committee called the unbroken intention of Congress to insist upon the application of the common law of agency in determining who was and who was not a member of the class of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.152" offset="806214">After the confrontation between Congress and the Court was resolved, the litigation began anew.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.566" offset="843935">In 1962, the Court decided a Social Security case in Enochs, applied the principles of the common law of agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.063" offset="881864">And then in 1968, when Justice White was here, it decided United Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.067" offset="905897">And the writer of that decision, Justice Black, said these word, which I thought were profound, and I want to repeat the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.257" offset="958664">He said, in trying to determine who was a member of the class of employees in a Labor Act case, there is no doubt, he said, there is no doubt that we should apply the common law agency test here in distinguishing an employee from an independent contractor.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.293" offset="1370772">There is no case that I know of... and I've looked hard because I thought somebody would ask me... there is no case that I know of which has ever turned and been made distinct by applying the common law principles of agency, and then twisting it one ratchet to make it by considering the remedial goals of ERISA, or the Labor Act, or the Social Security Act, to make it come out different.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.202" offset="1486442">Only one court that I know of has gone through the exercise of considering it, and that was the district court in Harlow, cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.280" offset="1526775">Judge Kobrines went through the exercise, and when he got through he decided that it made no difference to the outcome of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.056" offset="1561884">My answer is that it cannot be demonstrated that a consideration of the remedial goals of the legislation will give a different result than that which is obtained by the application of the principles of the common law, and anyway--</text>

            <text syncTime="684.683" offset="2876366">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="693.578" offset="2911997">If I could first turn to Justice Kennedy's question, I would like to add a few more comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.164" offset="2942299">Employee is a very basic term in ERISA and it's used in a variety of contexts, and I can think of three where an employer would very much need to know from the start whether he's dealing with employees or independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.062" offset="3001858">First, the basic tax qualification rule provides that a plan may only obtain the tax benefits available under ERISA if it exists for the exclusive benefits of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.903" offset="3057237">Second, ERISA's nondiscrimination rules allow tax benefits for plans only if the plans do not discriminate against low-compensation employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.570" offset="3111886">Again, you need to know what... who is an employee, and who is an independent contractor in figuring out whether there's discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.006" offset="3145636">Third, whether or not a plan qualifies for tax benefits which are available under title II of ERISA, if the plan affects employees, then the employer must comply with the reporting and disclosure provisions in title I of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.960" offset="3221495">So it's critical from the start for an employer to know whether he's dealing with people covered by the statute or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.123" offset="3254096">And that is why both Labor and the IRS provide for employers to get opinion... opinion letters from them, revenue rulings, as they are called in the case of the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.913" offset="3305296">And I think it's obvious, for the reasons Mr. Ragsdale stated, that the Fourth Circuit's test, which turns on the subjective reliance factors of individuals, is simply not a practical test to use here.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.476" offset="3391500">On the remand after the Fourth Circuit's first decision, the district court determined that Darden is an employee largely because, although he had opened an individual retirement account and had taken out an annuity, he had only put about $18,000 in those accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.960" offset="3469450">If he had put more money in the account, the district court would have found that he wasn't relying on Nationwide's plan, and would have found him to be an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.888" offset="3517201">We don't think that the qualification of plans can turn on such subjective criteria.</text>

            <text syncTime="901.565" offset="3743944">This is this Court's test set forth in Rutherford Food, which I think is the most relevant case for this Court to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.429" offset="3775396">Rutherford Food was the 1946 case involving the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.422" offset="3795353">The definition of employee in the Fair Labor Standards Act is identical to the definition of employee in section 36 of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.069" offset="3833910">That is, it says an employee is any individual employed by an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.473" offset="3855539">Now this Court looked primarily to the common law factors in determining whether the butchers involved in that case were employees or independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.961" offset="3897440">But it also said that Congress' choice of such broad language, any individual employed by an employer, indicated that in some cases the test might depart from the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.416" offset="3947281">This Court said that, page 728 of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.430" offset="3959402">It also added that it was most appropriate to look at industry practice to see whether a label was being attached simply to circumvent the purposes of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.399" offset="4015200">In the Rutherford Food case, for instance, these boners were clearly a part of the whole process of turning cattle into retail products.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.367" offset="4251138">As you said earlier, there's some venerable confusion involving the common law test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.491" offset="4275588">The common law test has led to clear answers in some... in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.146" offset="4294188">And indeed, we think it's led to a very clear answer with respect to insurance agents like Darden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.060" offset="4317907">They are independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.231" offset="4326579">But debit agents, for instance, the sort of collection agent involved in the United Insurance case, the courts, the State courts are all over the lot in the auto accident cases as to whether debit agents are independent contractors or whether they're employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.794" offset="4404842">We think in a situation where the common law test does not clearly lead to one result or another, it would be proper to consider the remedial purposes of ERISA and conclude, just as this Court concluded in applying the common law test, that debit agents might properly be considered the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1088.198" offset="4490419">I mean, the remedial purposes of ERISA include limiting ERISA to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.922" offset="4509332">It seems to me real bootstrapping to say, well, since you consult the remedial purposes of ERISA, and those remedial purposes are limited to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.159" offset="4558233">And therefore, for some reason we should expand the meaning of employees?</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="1108.051" offset="4569832">I think that there are certain close cases where it's not so much an expansion as a rule of how to determine whether someone like debit agents are on one side or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.726" offset="4608493">Let me turn to a second difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.339" offset="4623017">So this is what the rule means: in a close case they are employees and are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.273" offset="4638690">Is that what the broad remedial purposes thing means?</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.186" offset="4654364">--Well, unfortunately, it's not always that easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.247" offset="4662619">Sometimes the remedial purposes of ERISA would point, as in the Professional and Executive Leasing case, to a finding that the people in question were not employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.154" offset="4702220">That is the case that involves the second difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.645" offset="4712251">One of the common law factors is the label attached to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.288" offset="4734821">And there is... there have been many cases involving what seemed to be clear attempts to circumvent ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.053" offset="4761884">For instance, in that case, that was the case where the professionals, in order to avoid the nondiscrimination rules and not cover their nurses and secretaries, made an agreement that they would be employees of a leasing company which purported to lease them back to their professional corporations to provide services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.547" offset="4843804">In that case, looking at the whole transaction, the IRS, and then later the tax court, agreed that the professionals were not employees of this leasing company, but were in fact employees of the professional corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.757" offset="4904617">So that if the professionals wanted to set up a tax-qualified pension plan, they would have to cover some of their employees as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.832" offset="4937009">There's a third difference between the way the IRS and Labor approach these cases and the way it often works in the common law test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.218" offset="4978491">And the common law test is often applied as in the auto accident cases in an intensely fact-specific way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.335" offset="5010988">With the debit agents, for instance, there have been cases from the same State where a debit agent who's on his way to make a collection, their primary job is found to be an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.410" offset="5051321">But if a debit agent happens to be on the way to sell insurance to someone, he is found to be an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.276" offset="5082772">Now for the reasons I started out with in speaking to Justice Kennedy, it seems clear to us that a more categorical approach has to be taken under ERISA, and persons... there has to be a treatment of insurance agents employed... for instance in this case, all insurance agents covered by the same agency agreement with Nationwide have to be placed on one side of the line or the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.395" offset="5255180">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.705" offset="5268450">I represent the respondent Robert Darden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.108" offset="5278064">I ask the Court to affirm the judgment in Mr. Darden's favor, allowing him to receive his retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.732" offset="5308575">I'd like to discuss for just a second the history of these events of the statutes... the way one could look at them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.720" offset="5348490">The three cases that held that a broad remedial social legislation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Social Security Act, should be construed in a manner to reflect the broad remedial purposes of the statute, not just use the common law test, all took place in the 1940's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.395" offset="5447232">Three... two of those decisions are the ones, Hearst and U.S. v. Silk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.188" offset="5470429">Hearst case affected the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.340" offset="5482968">U.S. v. Silk interpreted the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.363" offset="5499059">Congress, in about 1947 or '48 came back and amended the Social Security Act, and also amended the National Labor Relations Act to specify that the term employee in those acts was to be construed using the common law interpretation, the common law agency interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.853" offset="5565097">Now the Fair Labor Standards Act, which is interpreted in the Rutherford Food Corporation case in about 1947, '46, has never been amended as far as I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.272" offset="5606684">That definition, statutory definition, is exactly the same as the statutory definition of employee which is contained in ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.045" offset="5637822">So that if you look at the state of the law in 1974, and that Congress had before it when they adopted ERISA, they knew that if they wanted to restrict the term employee to a common law meaning, they could write it in there like they had done before in the National Labor Relations Act and the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.319" offset="5718906">They could do it if they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.471" offset="5723504">Maybe they never thought about it, but they didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.743" offset="5736565">They adopted the same interpretation as the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.845" offset="5752970">And they knew when they did that that the Rutherford Food Corporation was still the law of the land, and is somewhat vague and difficult to understand as it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.112" offset="5786093">One could reasonably assume they knew they were adopting the statute, like the Department of Labor says, was a broad, remedial social statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.124" offset="5814096">And they also must have known the same time that under the Rutherford Food Corporation, the courts... the courts would look to the purposes of ERISA in interpreting the term employee and they wouldn't be bound solely by the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.444" offset="5875432">So that our argument is that you are writing a slightly more open book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.598" offset="5892046">And I add one other... one other fact to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.790" offset="5904793">That in 1961, this Court, in Goldberg v. Whitaker, held in a case involving the Fair Labor Standards Act, that some people who did some work at home in the crocheting field were employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.440" offset="5963412">And in that case, the Court repeated the ruling of the prior holdings that they'd done in Rutherford Food and the Hearst case by saying that the Court was not bound by the technical concepts of the common law, but would look to the purposes of the statute and use a definition based on the economic realities of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.233" offset="6050557">That was in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.394" offset="6059229">So the Court did that in '61.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.758" offset="6068633">Congress would have had that opinion before then, in 1974, when they enacted ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.230" offset="6086606">It was not clear... I mean, I'm not contending that one can say exactly what Congress intended, but you've got to assume Congress... or recently--</text>

            <text syncTime="1734.745" offset="7076646">But the Court concluded they were (a) dependent on this company for their livelihood, and they were really part of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.198" offset="7102455">Now in this case, in Mr. Darden's case, about who owned the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.443" offset="7127428">He... anybody that goes into business... I mean, the reason you go into business for yourself is to build up some equity, something you can use when you get old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.228" offset="7158566">You can sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.778" offset="7160761">You can retire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.898" offset="7165254">You can give it to your children.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.243" offset="7186570">So Mr. Darden built... he couldn't build up his own equity, his own business because Nationwide owned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.057" offset="7209871">They owned the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.822" offset="7240904">He couldn't sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.538" offset="7223768">So were he to retire... he couldn't give it to his children were he to retire.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.805" offset="7264832">That's why when you focus on that factor, that's the main one, the main contentions I have, is the Court should focus on retirement benefits itself, not necessarily the furniture.</text>

            <text syncTime="2460.230" offset="9978537">It seems to me you're better off in my view looking straight at the statute and Mr. Darden's particular facts, the particular things about Mr. Darden, and writing about that and citing on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.048" offset="10025871">The narrow, the very narrow basis, as narrow as possible, you leave open other considerations out of the circuit courts or other courts to follow, other people to follow, to interpret the ERISA and not close it off by saying you just can use these 10 or 11 factors out of the restatement of agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.656" offset="10380300">In further responding to Justice O'Connor, let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.561" offset="10399840">I said that the Solicitor General discussed this other kind of test, but that he did not propose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.038" offset="10437770">I have to stand by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.219" offset="10446547">And here is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.460" offset="10451458">And I stand by this is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.952" offset="10461489">He said the district court's initial decision applied the proper test and reached the correct result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.305" offset="10490850">That is indistinguishable from the position now taken by Nationwide and by me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.099" offset="10514047">He said, in our view, the district court approached this case properly and reached the correct result in its initial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.225" offset="10550514">I stand shoulder to shoulder with the Solicitor General on that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.369" offset="10567128">He said, the construction of employee, also this construction... that is the common law construction... also conforms to congressional use of that term in other context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.067" offset="10613939">And he said: The result reached by Judge Boyle is also consistent with the purposes of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.259" offset="10642674">Whatever else he may have discussed, that is what he proposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.163" offset="10662318">It is identical to that which Nationwide now proposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.634" offset="10676215">Justice White has held up--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="2638.047" offset="10689799">He also said in his brief, and he said here, that while those courts have avoided the erroneous path taken by the court below, it is unclear whether they are giving appropriate weight to this Court's decisions involving remedial social legislation, such as Rutherford Food, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.828" offset="10752911">--I concede that he discussed it, as he should, but he does not propose it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.353" offset="10779033">Justice White has held up to the true light the problem created by this Rutherford Foods case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.267" offset="10810694">And that is, he has gone over an looked at the verb, not the noun employee, but he found the right answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.833" offset="10844966">And he found congressional history in the verb to employ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.517" offset="10863670">Because in that act, that verb had a different meaning than it does here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.780" offset="10888748">And it was to suffer or permit to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.734" offset="10900555">And he is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.863" offset="10905048">That was born of the Child Labor Laws, where in this country at that time, apparently many little children were either being made to work or permitted to work, and Congress wanted to see that (a) they weren't allowed to if they weren't supposed to, and (b) if they were, they had to be paid a fair wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.556" offset="10979863">And so there is congressional history wrapped in another word in the Fair Labor Standards Act cases and that is in part a justification for perhaps a different view and a different treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.985" offset="11037541">In addition, and I'm not defending this, and I don't want to get into certain quagmires, but in addition to that, there is more congressional history, which is that Senator Black is quoted of the floor of the Senate as having said that the word employee in the Fair Labor Standards Act should be, was meant to be, and would be accorded the broadest possible use of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.190" offset="11138374">Now, if that's legislative history, and I don't want to argue about it, it is not in ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.565" offset="11163869">There is nothing similar to that in ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.547" offset="11175781">There is no reason for the Court, finding itself here in ERISA, between the Labor Act and Social Security Act cases, which Congress has declared itself on, and the Fair Labor Standards Act cases over here, there is no reason for the Court to veer from its path and go with the Fair Labor Standards Act definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.863" offset="11265120">Now, Mr. Follin, my good friend Mr. Follin... he and I have labored in this case for 10 wonderful years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.527" offset="11295735">He's a fine, wonderful lawyer and a good friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.239" offset="11314544">But he urges this Court to do exactly what the plaintiff's lawyers in the Hearst case must have urged the Court to do.</text>
