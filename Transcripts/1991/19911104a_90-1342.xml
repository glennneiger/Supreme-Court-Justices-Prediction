            <text syncTime="14.382" offset="208610">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.574" offset="221358">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the respondent's fear that he would be kidnapped by guerrillas to serve in their military in Guatemala rendered him a refugee eligible for asylum in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.373" offset="288545">We request this Court to reverse that decision and to uphold the board's order of deportation for two reasons that I'd like to briefly outline.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.629" offset="329610">First, the court of appeals did not apply the correct legal definition of the term, persecution on account of political opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.798" offset="370256">That term... the precise language of that term... has been a part of the United States immigration laws for decades, and more than 20 years ago it was interpreted by the board to require a showing that the persecutor's motive would be to inflict injury for the specific purpose of punishing him for adherence to political views that are offensive, to single him out--</text>

            <text syncTime="87.238" offset="500032">The board... in the closing argument of the... in the proceeding before the immigration judge the counsel for the Service specifically said that the respondent had failed to satisfy his burden of showing that he had been singled out based upon his political opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.408" offset="564712">Similarly, in the court of appeals there was a reference to that argument, and I would submit that it wasn't more fully briefed simply because between the time of the decision of the board and the time of the court of appeals there had been some intervening Ninth Circuit decisions which made it pretty clear that they had rejected the definition of persecution on account of political opinion that the board had historically applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.107" offset="683517">The board has very express language in its opinion that there was no basis to infer.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.762" offset="702116">In fact, they say that it could hardly be inferred that the guerrillas approached the respondent because they found his political beliefs to be offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.906" offset="734717">It very definitely... and it referenced two other decisions of the board, the matter of Vigil and also matter of Maldonado-Cruz which had been reversed by the Ninth Circuit thereafter, which relied precisely on these grounds... the definition of persecution on account of political opinion... and there--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="163.688" offset="805874">Ms. Mahoney, isn't it possible under this statute, that the applicant can demonstrate that he had a well-founded fear of persecution, even though the actual motive of the persecutor may be something he can't prove?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maureen_e_mahoney" startTime="183.961" stopTime="252.416">
            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="183.961" offset="886958">--Your Honor, there is no question that the standard of proof is a well-founded fear, and yes, it is theoretically possible that a guerrilla could in fact have a motive that did not constitute an intent to persecute, but if the objective evidence would support a reasonable inference that that was the motive, then certainly an alien could prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.458" offset="984970">But what is important here is that I believe that the issue of the standard of proof and the legal definition have been collapsed, and that it's important to establish first what is the legal definition to determine whether or not the board's decision was correct under that definition, since the board and not the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has to draw the inference... inferences from the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.591" offset="1073472">In this case, Your Honor, I don't think it's necessary to... to really articulate precisely what the standard of proof is, because there's really no reasonable inference on this record that the purpose of the guerrillas in seeking out the respondent was to punish him for political beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.192" offset="1143899">None of the indicia of that kind of conduct are present on this record.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.430" offset="1184859">I had thought that the respondent's position was that he would be in jeopardy because of his having rejected their initial approach and what they might do to him in the future--</text>

            <text syncTime="279.294" offset="1268241">I'd like to clarify what this record shows about that issue, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.086" offset="1287468">The Ninth Circuit specifically found that the respondent had a well-founded fear that he would be kidnapped and forced to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.705" offset="1329890">They did not find that he had a well-founded fear that his mere refusal for having served would result in his ultimate execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.840" offset="1362491">He testified at the hearing that he had a fear that he would be forced to serve, and he also suggested he had a fear he might be killed, but there was no objective evidence of that whatsoever, and on appeal the Ninth Circuit, I believe, found that he had a well-founded fear that he might be kidnapped because there was some objective evidence to support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.242" offset="1444098">The State Department had submitted a report that indicated that forcible recruitment does occur in Guatemala, but that same report that the Ninth Circuit accepts in part found that that practice did not support a claim that... that he would be singled out on the basis of his political opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.056" offset="1519330">In other words--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="342.615" offset="1521525">Well, if he had a well-founded fear that he would be killed, I take it that would be sufficient?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maureen_e_mahoney" startTime="347.147" stopTime="513.955">
            <label>Ms. Maureen E. Mahoney</label>
            <text syncTime="347.147" offset="1539706">--No, Your Honor, I would not say that it would be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.250" offset="1552140">It would then be necessary to determine whether or not the purpose that the guerrillas would have for killing him in response to the refusal was to punish him for his political beliefs, or whether it still was just yet another measure to try to enlist more soldiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.260" offset="1616088">I would say, though, that that... the question of that inference becomes somewhat different than the one that's presented on this record, where the only question is what... is it reasonable to infer that the purpose of kidnapping him for refusal to serve is a... an intent to punish him for his political beliefs, or is it simply to compel compliance with the request that they made for him to join their military?</text>
            <text syncTime="390.285" offset="1712219">That's the situation that this record, as the Ninth Circuit has found it, presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.139" offset="1735624">I'd like to turn again to the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.413" offset="1752761">The... there is a suggestion by the parties that there is no requirement that motive be proven, or that it even is an element of the definition, that instead it is simply sufficient if the respondent had a political opinion that caused him to engage in the activity which now subjects him to harm, and that that is persecution on account of political opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.459" offset="1848891">As I referenced, that has never been the definition... the articulated definition of persecution on account of political opinion throughout the history of our immigration laws and, in particular, this Court, in Cardoza-Fonseca and in Stevic, found that a controlling principle of interpretation of the refugee definition and the withholding of deportation was its conclusion that Congress intended to incorporate the preexisting practice prior to 1980 with respect to the terms that were used in that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.102" offset="1995490">One of those terms was persecution on account of political opinion, and in 1973 the board, in a case called Matter of Dunar, specifically used this articulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.421" offset="2048780">The board said Congress sought generally to shield aliens from the actions of their own home governments in singling them out for punitive treatment, not because of their individual misconduct or demerits, but solely because they are members of dissident or unpopular minority groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.313" offset="2120356">Congress sought to establish a preference for a very special category of people, not just anyone who might be subject to injury in war-torn countries, but those who were more in the nature of martyrs, those who had either political beliefs or religious beliefs that were deeply held and that were not tolerated by the societies that they lived in.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.597" offset="2217427">The statute doesn't speak directly to it, but is there any limitation on who the persecutor must be?</text>
            <text syncTime="524.523" offset="2249192">Does it have to be an act of the sovereign or can a nongovernmental group meet the definition?</text>
