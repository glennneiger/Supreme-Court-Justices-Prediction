            <text syncTime="12.098" offset="184660">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.823" offset="203572">The question in this Chapter 7 bankruptcy case is whether section 522(1) of the code, which provides for the raising of challenges to exemptions, in combination with Bankruptcy Rule 4003, which generally requires that that objection be made within 30 days after the meeting of creditors, is an absolute bar as, the Third Circuit held in this case, to a challenge to the exemption raised at a later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.522" offset="330319">There is a conflict in the circuits on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.425" offset="349963">There are three different positions that the lower Federal courts have taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.780" offset="367308">One represented by the Third Circuit in this case, which held that the 30-day period is an absolute bar, a second line of cases that the court at a later time can reexamine the exemption de novo, and a third line of cases holding that after the 30-day period the exemption may be challenged if it lacks a good faith statutory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.523" offset="458319">We are urging in this case that the Court adopt this third position, which is represented by decisions of the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.678" offset="490919">In a bankruptcy case the first act is the filing of the petition by the debtor, and at the same time that the petition is filed the debtor will also file a schedule of assets and a list of claimed exemptions, and in this case when the petition was filed on October 24th, 1984, the debtor made a claim of exemption for a lawsuit which she had pending against TWA, and she characterized it in the schedules as a claim for lost wages with the value unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.892" offset="635847">At that time, the case had wound its way through the State system.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.247" offset="661238">She had been successful in convincing the commonwealth court to affirm a judgment in her favor, and the case had been briefed and argued before the Pennsylvania supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.436" offset="709930">Within the time allowed in the code, the trustee appointed by the court, the petitioner in this case, held a meeting of creditors as he was required to do and examined the debtor about her assets, and in particular about this claim, and noted at the time that this was a possible asset case, meaning there were possible assets here to satisfy the claims of creditors, that asset being the claim against TWA, and shortly after the meeting of creditors he wrote to counsel for the debtor and advised them that he considered this claim to be an asset of the estate, i.e., that he considered it to be nonexempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.116" offset="884741">The claim continued and ultimately was resolved by settlement in favor of the debtor, and she collected approximately $110,000, and the question now is, the case having remained open for this time for the express purpose of pursuing this claim, whether the trustee in bankruptcy can now go after these proceeds, which were allowed to him in the amount of $23,000 here by the bankruptcy court... can go after these proceeds to satisfy the claims of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.667" offset="1018906">Now, the contention is by the respondents and the holding of the Third Circuit is that that is not permissible because section 522(1) of the Bankruptcy Code says that if there's no objection filed within 30 days after the creditors meeting that the property claimed as exempt is exempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.719" offset="11531102">Now, they later went forward towards a trial on damages and the matter was, of course, eventually settled, but at that point in time, at the critical point in time, the filing of the bankruptcy petition, liability was not finally determined.</text>
