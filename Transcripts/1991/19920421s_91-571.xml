            <text syncTime="14.660" offset="149468">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.924" offset="178516">It started in 1984 when Emily Davis filed a bankruptcy petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.492" offset="200772">At that time, Davis was pursuing a lawsuit against her employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.321" offset="220103">On a schedule filed with the Bankruptcy Court, Davis claimed that the proceeds from this lawsuit would be exempt from distribution to creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.464" offset="256674">She listed the value of the proceeds as unknown because she did not know whether she would win or lose the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.475" offset="288648">The bankruptcy trustee did not object.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.768" offset="301918">Several months later, while the bankruptcy case still was pending, Davis won $110,000 judgment against her employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.969" offset="342669">The trustee asked the Bankruptcy Court to include this money in Davis' bankruptcy estate so that he could distribute it to the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.060" offset="387078">The Bankruptcy Court granted the trustee's request, and both the District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.629" offset="425321">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk's office, we now reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.584" offset="449145">Davis claimed the proceeds from the lawsuit as exempt property.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.150" offset="467430">The relevant bankruptcy rule gave the trustee only 30 days to object to this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.535" offset="496896">The trustee missed this deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.467" offset="508704">Although the trustee argues that Davis had no statutory basis for claiming the property as exempt, we have no authority to create an exception to the 30-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.227" offset="555724">The proceeds, therefore, are exempt for distribution to creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.563" offset="573069">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
