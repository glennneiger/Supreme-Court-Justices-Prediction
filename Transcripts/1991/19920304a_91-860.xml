            <text syncTime="866.629" offset="3599841">But our basic submission is this, that it is quite wrong to believe, as the three judge court in Montana did, the majority did, that this Court's articulation of the one person, one vote standard, which of course was articulated and applied in the in-state setting that was at issue in Wesberry and in Karcher against Daggett, is applicable in this setting when that standard or ideal of absolute equality cannot in fact be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.793" offset="3736514">I should hasten to add that these methods are extremely similar in terms of their results.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.037" offset="3761487">Each uses the population of the state as the numerator.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.810" offset="3780608">The divisor varies from method to method, and there are certain variations.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.335" offset="3802656">But all of the, the three principle, I should say, competing methods are extremely close in terms of the results.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.072" offset="3833585">We're therefore quite far removed from what this Court was concerned about in Wesberry, the problem of rotten boroughs, as it were, which was of concern at the founding in terms of the gross disparity in district sizes.</text>

            <text syncTime="999.247" offset="4130336">And that prompted both Webster on the one hand and Adams on the other to come forward with their method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.402" offset="4154995">Webster's was employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.774" offset="4160429">Again the Congress employed the Vinton or Hamilton method in the 1850 methods, and what Congress was seeking to do in this area is find the best possible choice that maximized various indicia of equity, of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.837" offset="4228661">And they thought that equal proportions did that, and it clearly does not violate quota.</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.363" offset="4250812">When we have gone back and taken the numbers back to 1792, equal proportions would never have done what Jefferson and Adams could do and in fact did do in 1830.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.319" offset="4290623">It seems to us, in short, that the basic error of the three judge court was to transplant to alien soil a standard that does not apply, and in the process grossly intruded into the province of Congress which quite clearly has carefully, elaborately considered which method is best and chose that method, and sought to achieve something that Joseph Story in his commentaries in the 1830's suggested was very important, and that was stability and predictability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.331" offset="4418623">Congress thought it achieved that in 1941, with the irony that Senator Hugo Black urged the adoption of equal proportions, the author of Wesberry against Sanders.</text>

            <text syncTime="1106.095" offset="4557699">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.378" offset="4570865">If I could first of all answer a couple of questions that were posited during the Solicitor's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.603" offset="4595733">First of all with Justice Kennedy, how large would the House have to be to accommodate if the standard proposed by the State of Montana were adopted, namely the Dean method, the accommodation would occur in terms of adding two members, and then all three states, Washington, Massachusetts, and Montana, would then at that point in time have the representatives that they have currently been notified that they would secure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.348" offset="4690714">In terms of your question, Mr. Chief Justice, concerning fractional remainders, that will always be a problem until such time as the constitutional maximum is reached, which would be 1 for every 30,000, and of course that would approach 8,600 representatives which is quite obviously not a palatable solution, I would suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.320" offset="4762603">And in reference to the Adams method, Justice Stevens, you requested why is it that it can in fact create something known as the Alabama paradox, and that is because it ignores all the fractional remainders, and as a consequence it ends up providing fewer seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.711" offset="4832194">You run out of seats before in fact all of them are ultimately presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.983" offset="4845255">The question in Montana's view is does the standard for population equality enunciated in Wesberry and Kirkpatrick and Karcher apply to Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.992" offset="4889350">Does it apply to their congressional reapportionment duties?</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.495" offset="4903351">Or put another way, should the same standard of fairness required of all other governmental bodies, including local government bodies, apply to Congress when they apportion?</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.063" offset="4945565">Contrary to the suggestions of the United States in their brief, this Court is not being asked to second guess experts in the field of mathematics or to direct and any way dissect the statistical underpinnings of the five historically recognized apportionment methods, nor be able to distinguish between all the very complicated mathematical concepts that are involved in all five of these various formulas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.210" offset="5050159">The Court in our judgment need only determine which of the methods, which all have a different measure of equity, and which one of those methods is designed to meet the constitutional goal that has been articulated by this Court in the intrastate setting concerning apportionment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1282.918" offset="5264990">I think that's sort of an extreme position to take when we're trying to interpret what the Constitution requires and when the practice has gone back so far in the Nation's history of permitting Congress to make this sort of a determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1300.281" offset="5334476">--Justice O'Connor, I think a close examination of the apportionment history of this country would find that there has been more accommodation than there has been any process sustained in principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.675" offset="5372092">And that in fact if one takes a look at the cases that have been put forth by this Court with the intrastate reapportionment processes that occur, one will find a very simple thread throughout all of them, and that is, number one, you determine an ideal population district, the district size, by taking the total amount of the population and dividing the number of seats that are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.219" offset="5458192">That determines an ideal district size, and then all the deviations are measured from that ideal district size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.975" offset="5485255">The only formula that is agreed by all of the parties that does that is the Dean method, which has never been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.108" offset="5513781">So in our judgment, although there have certainly been accommodations throughout our history, the Dean method has never been used, and as a consequence does not come to the point where it meets this Court's demands within the intrastate setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.817" offset="5564563">And the question then becomes, in our judgment, whether or not we are going to require of Congress the same expectations that we require of states and other local government entities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.749" offset="6748328">Your Honor, because there is a requirement that each state be provided at least one, there is some built in inequity, but in our judgment that doesn't justify allowing the process to become more unequal by the application of a formula that simply doesn't produce the most equitable results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.598" offset="6807782">We have then with the method of harmonic means, the method advocated by the State of Montana, a deviation of 52 percent from the ideal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.303" offset="6846548">So quite obviously there will always be some opportunity for deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.477" offset="6863266">So under the Hill method or the method of equal proportions, the statutory method presently there, there's a 61 percent deviation from the ideal, which is reduced to a 52 percent deviation from the ideal under the method of harmonic means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.867" offset="6916765">And under Karcher and in the context of the intrastate reapportionment cases, this Court has held that a deviation of less than 1 percent from the ideal was not constitutionally acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.742" offset="6960337">Quite obviously those are different cases in different settings, but nonetheless this Court has been very, very precise in its examinations of intrastate redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.591" offset="6995655">And although not precisely described in Wesberry, the way this Court has determined whether one person's vote is worth as much as another's is described with particularity in the Kirkpatrick case in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.357" offset="7046750">What happens in that case and in every subsequent case is this, the ideal population equality is determined by taking the total population, and in that case Missouri, dividing by the number of congressional seats that were allocated to give an ideal district size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.640" offset="7111952">Then the range of variation is examined from the ideal to determine if in fact the range is acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.151" offset="7137970">In that case it was 25,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.025" offset="7149464">There were 2,260 below the ideal district size, and 13,542 above the ideal district size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.740" offset="7184259">So the total range of deviation was 5.97 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.623" offset="7203799">More important, however, is the fact that in Kirkpatrick that is when this Court first with precision and particularity described a method that was going to be utilized in determining whether or not in fact the apportionment was capable of being accepted constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.045" offset="7265552">The Court then went on in 1973 to White v. Weiser, as I am certain you are all aware, and in that case disapproved plans that provided for a deviation in the range of 4.13 percent and one that also provided for a deviation, a total range of deviation of 0.284 percent in favor of one that provided a total deviation of 696 people, or a deviation, a total range of deviation of 0.149 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.362" offset="7374744">And then of course in Karcher we know precisely what occurred, that there was in fact an ideal district size determined, then the range was determined, and the Court affirmed the district court's order striking down that districting plan which had less than 1 percent in total deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.251" offset="7438378">Now lest anyone question whether or not in fact this has remained the principle and the method employed by this Court, I would refer the Court to the Board of Estimate of the City of New York v. Morris in 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.871" offset="7492817">And in that particular case the Court once again pointed out that the guarantee of 1 person, one vote extended to local government apportionment as well as to congressional and state districting plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.131" offset="7541823">And quoting Daniel Webster the Court pointed out that the right to choose a representative is every man's portion of sovereign power, and that the electoral system should strive to make each citizen equal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2232.408" offset="9062985">It may be entirely irrelevant, but to the extent we're talking about overall national fairness and so forth, is it at all relevant to consider the fact that Montana has two senators?</text>

            <text syncTime="2240.946" offset="9097154">No, sir, I don't believe so, because the system was set up that that was obviously the product of a great compromise, and the system was set up so that states, the corporate entities, would be represented, and then in the House where people would be represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.687" offset="9164132">And that's why this is so incredibly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.018" offset="9173431">I don't think that one can fairly and completely understand what it is like to be disadvantaged in this particular arena until such time as you personally experience it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.914" offset="9213033">And quite frankly, that at that point in time, as I believe Mr. Wilson pointed out at the convention, indicated that waters of bitterness flow from unequal representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.360" offset="9254829">And quite honestly in this case what we have is a river of equality that has been demanded by this Court, and the tributaries are the states and local government, but it is Congress that sits at the headwaters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.828" offset="9296625">And unless we require of Congress the same standard that we require of the states, how is it that we can expect the system to be equal?</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.823" offset="9328599">So if we're going to allow for the method presently there, and whatever happens in this courtroom and ultimately the decision of this Court is going to say something to Congress and to the members of this Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.661" offset="9371962">And if Montana's position is upheld and the district court judgment is affirmed it will say, I believe, that the same rules apply to Congress, they go from the school house to the court house to the state house to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.917" offset="9420968">And if it is reversed it will say that Congress can play by a different set of rules, that it does in fact, as the Solicitor has recommended, have unfettered discretion in spite of what's demanded of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.856" offset="9472794">So I believe painstaking precision in the drawing of congressional district boundaries by the states is going to be hollow indeed if apportionment at the national level is poisoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.244" offset="9518352">The Court has not tolerated of the states that they simply provide relatively equal amount of equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.858" offset="9544788">They require that they do that with precision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2370.514" offset="9615423">I would like to submit that point on the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.295" offset="9622528">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.696" offset="9632141">But with respect to the suggestion that equal proportions rides roughshod over concerns about absolute differences, I refer the Court to Footnote 38 in our brief, which I think goes a long way to suggesting that there is, with all respect to our colleagues from Montana, a certain artificiality about their argument, even accepting, as we urge the Court not to do, their basic proposition that Congress is bound by the Constitution to embrace a particular measure of equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.064" offset="9793578">But once we move beyond that area where we can achieve absolute equality in crossing state lines, we see in these rivers of inequality that have been referred to that under the Dean method there are very considerable inequalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.922" offset="9857003">Essentially what Montana wants, and it's quite understandable, is to go to the smallest state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.868" offset="9884798">It doesn't like being the largest single district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.601" offset="9899740">It wants, as it would be under its proposed method, the state that enjoys the smallest by far of the congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.736" offset="9940282">And when we look to those absolute deviations in population, I shouldn't use the term deviation, but absolute differences, what we see is that it is not at all curious that an equal proportions method designed to achieve goals of equity and fairness results in a state that has been over represented for some time, now being relatively under represented for a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.923" offset="10044981">And that it is curious in the extreme that the Constitution of the United States would require Washington, with a higher fractional remainder than that of Montana, to lose that representative and give it to Montana with its 1.404 in comparison to Washington state's 8.538.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.496" offset="10127319">With respect to the articulation of the standard, yes, it's quite true that the Constitution does not speak in words of equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.191" offset="10162114">This Court has inferred that, but it has inferred it from section 1, using the term the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.246" offset="10190326">And this Court in its decisions in Yarborough and Classic over the years has viewed that as endowing a personal interest on the part of each of our citizens in participating in the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.426" offset="10239018">Clause 3 speaks in terms of the states, a process in which Congress or the states are represented, are given their apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.001" offset="10273395">It is a process that speaks in terms of that which history tells us, that it has been a process entrusted to the political branches, but political branches that have been quite sensitive to the needs for basic fairness and equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.099" offset="10329715">And it is beyond dispute that the equal proportions method, among others, achieves those goals.</text>
