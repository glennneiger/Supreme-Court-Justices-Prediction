            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90853">No. 90-1074 Estelle against Mcguire.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.755" offset="113841">In this case respondent, Mark Mcguire and his wife arrived at a hospital in California with their six-month-old daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.406" offset="148427">The child suffered from numerous bruises and internal injuries, was bluish in color, and was not breathing.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.762" offset="177893">In spite of efforts to revive, the child died 45 minutes later.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.767" offset="197851">Mcguire was charged with a second degree murder of the infant.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.103" offset="215196">At trial, the prosecution introduced evidence that the child had been a victim of abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.672" offset="237452">In particular, the battered child testimony revealed evidence of rectal tearing which was at least six weeks old and evidence of partially healed rib fractures which were approximately seven weeks old.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.634" offset="289384">The prosecution also introduced evidence that Mcguire's wife had previously voiced her fear of Mcguire's dangerous nature and that she had expressed skepticism at Mcguire's explanation for the infant's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.434" offset="340584">The jury convicted Mcguire of second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.567" offset="357093">The California State Courts affirmed the conviction holding that the evidence of prior injuries was properly admitted under state law to establish what is called the battered child syndrome.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.224" offset="407666">Mcguire then sought federal habeas relief and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit set aside his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.179" offset="439535">It ruled that the prior injury evidence was erroneously admitted to establish the battered child syndrome and that the Trial Court's jury instruction on the use of prior act evidence allowed a finding of guilt based simply on the judgment that Mcguire had done bad things in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.563" offset="513096">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and hold that state law errors are not a basis for federal habeas relief, and conclude that neither the introduction of the challenged evidence nor the jury instructions as to its use deprive Mcguire of his federal constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.321" offset="600136">Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice Stevens has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.337" offset="628140">Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration of this case.</text>
