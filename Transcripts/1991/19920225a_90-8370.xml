            <label>Mr. Michael Pescetta</label>
            <text syncTime="401.385" offset="1747736">I think that suspicion might be rational, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.462" offset="1764036">But what I am contending, Your Honor, is that there is a line of cases, this Court's cases dealing with Government intrusion on fundamental rights and other criminal contexts, for instance... Lego v. Twomey, United States v. Matlock... where a preponderance burden is placed on the Government to get the defendant out from under a constitutional protection which he has brought himself within.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.265" offset="1859226">I submit that that is... that that same kind of analysis is apt here.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.872" offset="1877721">I submit that there are certainly cases applying the Mathews analysis, like Addington v. Texas where a higher standard of proof has been imposed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.039" offset="1926309">We are arguing here only that a preponderance standard to show competence to stand trial is constitutionally mandated, because in this very difficult area the risk of error can be shared no more by the defendant than by the State, and that that analysis leads to the result that showing competence by a preponderance will satisfy the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.278" offset="2031321">If the Court would like to go further, I would not object to that, but I think that disposes of this case, certainly, because in this case the evidence is very, very closely balanced and a finding that the Federal Constitution requires a showing at least by a preponderance, I submit, will result in a reversal of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.193" offset="2110942">To go back to the analytical structure for a moment, I think that we can think of the constitutional structure that is imposed by the Lego-Matlock line of cases in the following way.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.186" offset="2178965">Once the defendant has brought him or herself within the ambit of a constitutional protection, in a case like Nix v. Williams, for instance, has shown that there was a search, that there was no warrant, that something was actually seized that's going to be admitted into evidence, that once the defendant is underneath that constitutional umbrella that the burden then constitutionally, appropriately, shifts to the State to boot the defendant back out into the rain by showing, as in Nix v. Williams, that there is an inevitable discovery of that same evidence.</text>

New York, that there is a different analysis when the State has brought the defendant by proving the commission of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt within a constitutionally acceptable umbrella of culpability, that then the burden can appropriately and constitutionally be placed on the defendant to get him or herself back out from under that level of... that umbrella of culpability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.827" offset="5165492">And it makes a very substantial, in fact a fundamental outcome-determinative difference, in those cases in which, when the defendant has produced a draw, as Your Honor puts it, when we have to decide what is the worst damage that is done... trying that defendant when he is arguably incompetent, or committing him as incompetent when there is a chance that he is in fact competent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.473" offset="5400072">Now, if that individual is in fact competent there is an easy means by which the director of the facility to which the defendant is committed can return that defendant almost immediately to the Court he or she came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.187" offset="5458900">The evidence that we've supplied in the studies by Roesch and Golding, who are I think the leading authorities in this field, shows that an average stay in a commitment as incompetent is 43 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.681" offset="5512921">And just to put that in perspective, if I may, that's less than half of the time that this Court allows for petitioning for certiorari in a criminal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.490" offset="5860141">In either event, he would have been committed to a mental health facility, where, I think the studies show unanimously, the chances of a more accurate determination of whether Mr. Medina is or is not, in fact incompetent, can or cannot voluntarily cooperate with counsel, can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.920" offset="5937881">And I submit that the increase in the accuracy of the decision which is afforded by that commitment to a mental health facility is also a factor pushing in favor of saying that the consequences of an erroneous finding of incompetence are less serious than the consequences of an erroneous finding of competence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.341" offset="6895530">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.385" offset="6915697">California's allocation of the burden of proof to the moving party in a competency determination offends no principle of justice which is so rooted in our traditions and conscience to be ranked as fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.490" offset="6968150">Additionally, the California procedure is in accord with the Federal Government, which provides similarly in a statute which was amended in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.469" offset="7012036">Additionally, of the 14 legislatures of States which have specifically addressed the allocation of a burden of proof, 11 of the 14 comport with California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.027" offset="7058325">Moreover, the competency determination is unique in that it can be raised by the defense, by the prosecution, or sua sponte by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.008" offset="7098240">So accordingly it is important to recall that there may be defendants who are not resisting a competency determination but nevertheless are subject to the litigation which may ultimately lead to their confinement without any determination of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.156" offset="7166786">There may be defendants with strong defenses to criminal charges who are precluded from making those defenses because of an incompetency determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.401" offset="7223837">You're suggesting that a defendant may not always welcome a determination of incompetency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.774" offset="7245257">--Indeed, and that has been the case in some instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.179" offset="7262916">I would invite the Court's attention to United States v. Hemsi out of the Second Circuit, a 1990 case at 901 Fed 2d 293, which illustrates this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.470" offset="7312026">In that particular prosecution it was the Government who initiated the incompetent proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.203" offset="7335014">The defense counsel took the stand and testified in favor of a competency finding, and ultimately it was appealed to the Second Circuit, the incompetency determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.450" offset="7380049">So we cannot assume that each and every defendant is seeking the incompetency determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.439" offset="7631974">But I'd like to discuss the delay, because in reading petitioner's brief there are references to the majority being returned immediately and the rest being returned quickly, and there are studies referencing averages of 43 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.668" offset="7688921">And counsel this morning has indicated that the California Penal Code provides for a report within 15 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.025" offset="7718283">So he's talking days, and I don't think that's appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.773" offset="7733329">The Penal Code section counsel refers to section 1370, subsection (a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.082" offset="7758511">That provides for a report in 15 days to the trial court as to whether defendant will go to an outpatient program or be committed to a mental institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.095" offset="7798531">It's not a determination as to competency at 15 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.390" offset="7815772">The California law provides for a 90-day period for the initial diagnostic evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.277" offset="7843357">The Federal provision, which is the same, provides for a 4-month commitment to a mental institution, so we're not talking days.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.677" offset="7908872">Now, with respect to his 43-day figure, I have some problems with that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.081" offset="7926531">The one study which counsel cites relating to California relates to Atascadero, which is but one of California's mental hospitals, but that particular study references the majority of incompetent defendants being returned in a little over 3 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.840" offset="7997584">Now, that is just one study, and the California law provides for a full competency hearing again at 18 months in the event that someone is still committed and has not yet been certified mentally competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.942" offset="8061950">And the legislature selected 18 months for a reason, and in the Pacific Law Journal, Volume 6, at page 492, at footnote 67, they cite California Department of Health records relating to all commitments pursuant to Penal Code section 1370, and those records indicate that the majority of defendants are returned within 2 years, and this is a significant difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="2006.573" offset="8168529">Supposing in the institution the people in the institution think this fellow is malingering and he's really perfectly competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.022" offset="8194338">Is there any procedure by which they can bring that fact to the attention of the court?</text>

            <label>Ms. Holly D. Wilkens</label>
            <text syncTime="2018.910" offset="8217848">Absolutely not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.551" offset="8220356">If at any time at the mental health facility the experts arrive at an opinion that the individual is indeed competent, he is returned to court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.470" offset="8264033">But again it's important to note that the California procedures provide for expert evaluations prior to the hearing on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.746" offset="8301231">So if an individual is particularly adept at fooling the experts in that context, there's no reason to suggest that he will be returned immediately, based on the evaluations in the hospital setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2052.414" offset="8351804">No, but isn't there this different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.789" offset="8353372">Maybe I don't understand the procedure, but isn't it different that if he's been committed to an institution where he's under 24-hour-a-day custody and supervision by experts in mental health, they have one body of facts to work with, whereas if he has not had a hearing at all, isn't he in a normal jail, or he's not necessarily in a mental institution when the issue arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.328" offset="8427559">So you don't... the State has had a different amount of access to the relevant facts at the second hearing than it would have at the first hearing.</text>

          <turn speaker="holly_d_wilkens" startTime="2078.746" stopTime="2192.076">
            <label>Ms. Holly D. Wilkens</label>
            <text syncTime="2078.746" offset="8457234">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.371" offset="8459638">He may not even be in custody prior to the hearing on mental competency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.900" offset="8481790">So with respect to delay, there is a significant difference, however, and the State does have a concern with respect to malingering, because as the expert testimony below from petitioner's own expert indicates, avoiding the death penalty is a motivation for malingering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.533" offset="8556291">And counsel has indicated that there will be little litigation on the issue of mental competency, but I would suggest that it will come in the cases that California has the greatest interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.950" offset="8597982">That is, the more serious the offense the greater the motivation to malinger, and this is something that has been recognized historically since 1847 when Hale observed that it would be appropriate to empanel a jury to see if a claim of madness is real or fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.350" offset="8671648">So with respect to the State's interest, it is enhanced in the sense that the delay is putting these people back into the system at the initial point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.532" offset="8716369">It is in all probability the most serious of offenders and those of the greatest concern to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.139" offset="8738730">Additionally, as this case serves to illustrate, California has a strong interest in not having individuals in a hospital setting, other than those who are truly deserving of the evaluation, because as the experts again agreed in their testimony, there are individuals, career criminals, very serious, dangerous individuals, who will seek out a hospital setting because it is less secure and they are more likely to perfect an escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.877" offset="8857744">So there is attendant risk to the State both in delay to the strength of the prosecution's case and with respect to facilitating the incarceration of serious offenders in a hospital setting.</text>
