            <text syncTime="14.392" offset="205296">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.474" offset="217626">This case involves a challenge to a different type of state statute, namely a taxing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.346" offset="245211">It involves specifically how the State of Iowa taxes dividends received by parent companies doing business there from their foreign subsidiaries and perhaps domestic subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.976" offset="299651">Petitioner is a multi-state, multinational corporation engaged in business throughout this country and in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.692" offset="334550">Its domicile is in Illinois, it does business in Iowa, of course, and other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.415" offset="353463">During the year at issue it received approximately $10 million in dividends from foreign subsidiaries, each of which engaged in business only in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.491" offset="397767">Under Iowa's law it was required to include those dividends in its tax base and to compute its Iowa income tax with respect to those dividends by full inclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.820" offset="455027">Had it received any dividends from other subsidiaries during that year it would not have been required to include those dividends in its tax base under the Iowa law.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.449" offset="505600">The Iowa law adopts the Federal Internal Revenue Code as the basis for taxation, and under the Federal Internal Revenue Code only dividends from foreign subsidiaries doing business in foreign countries are required to be included in income and receive no offsetting deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.054" offset="592013">Petitioner challenged the Iowa statute as being facially discriminatory, singling out for inclusion in the tax base only the dividends from foreign subsidiaries doing business in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.954" offset="651572">The Iowa Court, Supreme Court, rejected petitioner's challenge, holding that the statute was constitutional because it could find no basis for a benefit resulting that was peculiar to Iowa with respect to application of the statute.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="145.665" offset="730462">Well, Mr. Libin, now I take it that under the Federal Income Tax Code that there is a foreign tax credit and these dividends, if taxed in the foreign country, then a credit is given on the Federal income tax, dollar for dollar.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.947" offset="859611">That would be impermissible, I think, and the footnote number 30 in Container, in the decision of this Court in Container indicates that a credit at the state level for foreign taxes paid would probably not be permissible because you already have received full credit at the Federal level.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.107" offset="928157">So why isn't it perfectly rational for the state to exclude, then, any recognition of the foreign, or go ahead and tax the foreign subsidiary dividend?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jerome B. Libin</label>
            <text syncTime="211.190" offset="992523">It certainly has the power to tax foreign subsidiary dividends without a credit, Justice O'Connor, but what we believe is clearly correct under this Court's decisions is that it does not have the power to single out those dividends for taxation vis-a-vis all other kinds of dividends, because they're, that is discrimination under the Foreign Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.372" offset="1073293">It singles out dividends generated in foreign commerce for taxation, it does not impose a tax on dividends generated in domestic commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.488" offset="1109760">And under Complete Auto in Japan line, the test for determining whether a statute infringes on and violates the Foreign Commerce Clause is whether it is non-discriminatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.474" offset="1153646">Well, the state just wants to piggy-back on the Federal income tax law, a perfectly reasonable desire on the part of the state, and many states do the same thing, don't they?</text>

            <text syncTime="263.433" offset="1201502">26 of the states that piggy-back off of the Federal tax law have eliminated this discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.516" offset="1225848">They have faced up to the problem and said it is not correct to tax only foreign subsidiary dividends, so we will either tax both or neither.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.082" offset="1260121">Mr. Libin, a minute ago you said you can't tax dividends from foreign commerce versus dividends from domestic commerce, but that's one... it isn't necessarily dividends from foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.312" offset="1312993">It could be a foreign subsidiary that does business in the United States, just as in other cases it could be a domestic subsidiary that does foreign commerce business.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.387" offset="1585293">You had the option under the Federal income tax law to deduct, to elect a deduction of these dividends, and if you had exercised that option you would have had the same deduction under Iowa law, correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="1166.696" offset="4814550">We're looking at the tax on dividends at the parent level, and whether the subsidiaries are taxed at all in the first instance ought to be irrelevant to how a state taxes dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.593" offset="4862198">The dividends are a separate item of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.954" offset="4875572">Container footnote 30 indicates earnings are income of the subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.708" offset="4894589">Dividends are income of the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.410" offset="4905456">And your own dissent in the Mobil case suggests dividends are not always paid out of earnings immediately, they may not mirror the earnings of any given year, they may be paid later or earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.335" offset="6357133">Kraft includes foreign dividends in its Iowa apportionable tax base because of the way it chooses to structure its business, and not because it engages in foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.394" offset="6405303">Obviously some methods or structures of operating will be more profitable than other methods, but Kraft's conclusion that the use of foreign subsidiaries is integral to doing foreign commerce is based on lots of factors unrelated to taxes and which may vary depending on the type of business you look at and the particular foreign country in which they do business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.120" offset="6612297">The parties did not stipulate that all foreign countries require that in order to do commerce in those countries you use a foreign subsidiary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.574" offset="7078113">And that reason is the same reason the Internal Revenue Code has, which is how the underlying earnings from which the dividends are paid get treated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1752.948" offset="7159615">The only time the foreign earnings get taxed in the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore also by Iowa, is if they are returned to the U.S. shareholder in the form of dividends, and then it's only that amount that gets returned as dividends that is taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.258" offset="7216771">But with the domestic subsidiary, whether it's doing business in the United States or doing business abroad, all of its earnings will be taxed by the United States and an apportioned share will be taxed in the states in which it does business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.641" offset="8406387">This is, however, a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, so this Court could also very easily go ahead and decide the constitutionality question at this level rather than remanding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.967" offset="8459677">There's no additional findings of fact that need to be made, and so forth, because it is a facial challenge to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.114" offset="8492278">The... as I was saying about the fact that Kraft could structure its business in such a way as to avoid having foreign dividends included in the tax base, in the Amerada Hess case where oil companies had claimed that a denial of a deduction for the Windfall Profits Tax discriminated against oil producers who also marketed their oil, in other words integrated oil companies, in favor of independent retailers who did not produce their oil but who could effectively deduct an equivalent to the Windfall Profits Tax as part of their cost of goods sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.905" offset="8675344">In that case operating an integrated oil company may have been more efficient and profitable than using separate corporations, as Kraft argues that using foreign subsidiaries is the more profitable way of doing foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.964" offset="8735634">But the Court stated that whatever different effect the statute had on the two groups was based solely from differences between the nature of their businesses and not from the location of their activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.763" offset="8782864">And that is definitely true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.573" offset="8790074">Two subsidiaries could both be doing business in the same geographical location and the dividends from a domestic subsidiary doing business in the foreign country would be deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.131" offset="8840333">The Commerce Clause protects the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.632" offset="8850260">It does not protect the particular structure or method of operating in that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.776" offset="8874919">And the anti-discrimination requirement promotes equal treatment of foreign commerce, but not identical treatment of all taxpayers that are engaged in such commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.723" offset="8918700">If the foreign government requires the use of foreign subsidiaries, then obviously it's that foreign government and not Iowa which is placing some restriction on the doing of foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.953" offset="8971572">And indeed Kraft could have set up a domestic holding company to receive the foreign income, and then would pass that income on to the parent company, Kraft, in the form of what would be deductible domestic dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.771" offset="9026847">Kraft argues that if we look at what happens if all states apply the same tax scheme as Iowa, then those foreign dividends will still be taxed by some state, and that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.640" offset="9070315">But what Kraft does not point out is that if all states applied Iowa's tax scheme, then the earnings of domestic subsidiaries, regardless of what state the domestic subsidiary does business in, will be taxed as well by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.530" offset="9129874">And the earnings of a domestic subsidiary are likely to be greater than dividends from a foreign subsidiary, assuming equal earnings, because the foreign subsidiary is not likely to pay out all of its earnings in the form of dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.637" offset="9186299">We believe that if you look at the entire unitary business, and we believe that is proper to do, that the subsidiaries are really an extension of Kraft's own business and you look at how the Iowa corporate income tax taxes that unitary business, that the state tax burden on a unitary business that operates through domestic subsidiaries will likely actually be greater than the state tax burden on a unitary business that does foreign commerce through foreign subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.580" offset="9322136">This is a facial challenge to the statute, as I mentioned, and therefore Kraft has the burden of showing that it, the statute is unconstitutional, and that burden is that it must establish that there is no set of circumstances which exist under which the statute would be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.075" offset="9404056">And the fact that a statute might operate unconstitutionally under some specified set of circumstances is insufficient to make the statute invalid on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.001" offset="9451807">And Kraft cannot show that this statute discourages or burdens foreign commerce or even doing foreign commerce through foreign subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.027" offset="9487856">With regard to the Equal Protection issue, Kraft characterizes the state's interest as being administrative convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.401" offset="9521398">Iowa sees it more as being a necessity, as being quite essential that we be able to piggy-back onto the Internal Revenue Code, and not just being merely convenient for the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.128" offset="11152274">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.044" offset="11179964">Looking at Iowa's entire scheme of taxation, as this Court's cases say we must, it becomes evident that by including foreign subsidiary dividends in its tax base Iowa does not discriminate against foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.452" offset="11237538">And this is for a very simple reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.883" offset="11247256">Both Iowa and the United States tax all of the domestic and foreign source income of domestic corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.230" offset="11280692">They also tax the domestic source income of foreign corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.953" offset="11299605">But they tax only that portion of the foreign income of foreign corporations that is distributed as dividends to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.460" offset="11337639">In short, Iowa's tax is less inclusive of foreign source income derived by a foreign subsidiary than it is either of domestic or foreign source income derived by a domestic subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.611" offset="11398243">For this simple reason it cannot be said that Iowa's tax facially discriminates either against foreign commerce or against foreign, subsidiaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.862" offset="11911184">And that leaves open the question that I need to address, which is Kraft's argument now is that even though they may have less of their income subject to a state tax, they want to complain about the fact that they may have a higher national level tax when they use a foreign subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.133" offset="11980356">This is because the foreign government may choose to tax both the earnings of the foreign subsidiary and the dividends as those dividends are distributed to a United States corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.924" offset="12027481">What we showed in our brief is that exactly the same result applies to a similarly situated domestic corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.246" offset="12056738">That is to say under the Internal Revenue Code the United States taxes both the earnings of a domestic corporation and it taxes the dividends of a domestic corporation when they are distributed abroad, when they are distributed to a foreign corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.347" offset="12117133">The result is thus precisely parallel treatment of foreign and domestic commerce, not discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.197" offset="12296542">In Container Corporation what this Court held was that the risk of additional burdens at the national level is mitigated by the credits allowed under the Internal Revenue Code for foreign taxes.</text>
