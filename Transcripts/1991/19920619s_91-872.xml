            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90847">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in United States versus Salerno, 91-872.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.610" offset="125224">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.235" offset="155735">A federal grand jury indicted Anthony Salerno and six other respondents on various charges including racketeering and fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.829" offset="190112">The indictment alleged that they have attempted to rig bids on construction projects in New York City by controlling the supply of cement.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.443" offset="236610">Two witnesses provided exculpatory testimony to the grand jury, but they pleaded the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.166" offset="271510">The respondents asked the Trial Court to admit transcripts of the grand jury testimony into evidence, but the court refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.778" offset="305887">The jury later convicted the respondents of various federal crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.214" offset="323650">The Court of Appeals reversed the respondent's conviction on ground that the Trial Court should have admitted the transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.829" offset="354161">In an opinion filed with the Clerk's office, we now reverse the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.120" offset="383314">Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b) authorizes admission of the formal testimony of unavailable witnesses but only when the opposing party had a similar motive to develop the testimony at the prior hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.165" offset="443500">In this case, the Court of Appeals did not decide whether the United States had a similar motive to develop the statements made by the two witnesses at the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.680" offset="485505">We remand the case so that the Court of Appeals may consider this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.493" offset="504731">Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
