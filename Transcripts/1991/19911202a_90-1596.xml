            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="55.135" offset="365094">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="58.003" offset="376588">This case brings before the Court a decision by the Spotted Owl Panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declaring unconstitutional a statute passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.660" offset="427161">That act embodied what is known popularly as the Northwest Timber Compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.083" offset="452866">That compromise was designed to resolve ongoing controversy over logging activities in various areas that serve as a habitat for the northern spotted owl.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.641" offset="503125">Specifically, section 318 of the Department of Interior Appropriations Act set forth in quite elaborate detail the terms of a compromise that was hard-fought over logging activity in the Pacific Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.083" offset="568850">It had divided not only industry and industrial groups; it had divided communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.756" offset="595599">There was a great sense of distress and a sense of urgency.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.625" offset="615034">Congress' response was section 318.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.195" offset="629349">In the Ninth Circuit's view, however, one critical part of that compromise... subsection (b)(6)(A)... was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.051" offset="672817">In the Ninth Circuit's view, that subsection stepped across the permissible constitutional line between the Congress repealing or amending a statute and going beyond and into the province of article III by directing the Federal courts how to decide, in this instance, two pending cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.452" offset="770410">In our view, the court of appeals erred, and in so doing violated one of the cardinal principles of constitutional adjudication by interpreting a statute needlessly so as to raise article III questions when there is an entirely plausible reading of the statute that avoids the article III controversy entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.375" offset="1026097">Now, Justice Stevens' question brings me to the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.262" offset="1045637">It took us 13 pages to set this out in the appendix to our brief, 12-1/2, to be precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.516" offset="1078655">It is complicated, but there are three basic aspects to this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.153" offset="1097150">First, it directs the Forest Service and the BLM to offer timber sales at specified levels at... during fiscal year 1990, and it says this shall be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.711" offset="1147410">It's quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.496" offset="1154515">Second, the statute sets forth a standard that is to guide the Federal agencies in the timber sales process.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.351" offset="1185966">It does something quite important from the environmentalists' standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.804" offset="1199759">It expands significantly the protected areas of habitat for the spotted owls.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.708" offset="1227449">It establishes a streamlined administrative process and provides, as the original version on which our colleagues on the other side seek to use, something that the earlier version did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.366" offset="1278022">It provides for judicial review of specific sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.420" offset="1298293">Third, and then critically for purposes of this case, we come to (b)(6)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="294.906" offset="1324206">That does two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.893" offset="1340193">I want to call the Court's attention first, lest I overlook it, to the second sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.195" offset="1361300">I think that's critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.047" offset="1368719">The Congress says in the second sentence of (b)(6)(A) that the standards that the guidelines adopted by law, by subsections (b)(3) and (b)(5), shall not be subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.057" offset="1432771">The first sentence... and of course, it was the first sentence that was held unconstitutional, and it says, in short, without--</text>

            <text syncTime="368.069" offset="1616882">Now, what does (b)(3) and (b)(5) do?</text>
            <text syncTime="370.186" offset="1625346">Primarily, what those two subsections do, which are insulated from judicial review, is to expand the areas of protected habit, the so-called SOHA's.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.329" offset="1681875">That's what this fight is all about.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.900" offset="1712177">Our colleagues on the other side believe we should have none of this activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.971" offset="1732448">Congress is saying, it is our business to step in and to resolve divisive controversies that raise important questions of public policy, and those questions were very emphatically discussed and debated on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.182" offset="1797336">In our petition for certiorari we set forth the quotation that we also allude to in our opening brief by Senator Adams of Washington, who said, we no longer have time to work this out at a leisurely pace.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.192" offset="1861388">The litigation has been enormously divisive and disruptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.577" offset="1878838">We need a solution, and here is our comprehensive solution for 1 year and 1 year alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="3357.828" offset="13575844">Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, the first point is, in our reply brief at page 12 we enumerate a number of statutes passed by Congress that specifically refer to pending litigation and deems the settlement that is approved by the Congress of the United States to have been made in accordance with the Constitution and all laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.296" offset="13677721">Secondly--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3383.930" offset="13680334">Are any of those deeming statutes appropriations measures?</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.048" offset="13692768">That was part of the ground for the decision below, that they didn't think this change could be made in an appropriations measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.600" offset="13714920">The Government has no problem with that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="3394.202" stopTime="3479.992">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="3394.202" offset="13721398">--These are claims against the United States as well as against States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.023" offset="13744699">But the answer is, with respect to appropriations act, I think the law is clear that Congress is at liberty to lay down a substantive rule of law in an appropriations act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.413" offset="13794228">We may not admire that as an orderly way of proceeding legislatively, but there's nothing that requires, in the Constitution at least, for Congress to be orderly and careful about the way it does its work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.773" offset="13847622">Secondly, the theory that we have just heard essentially amounts to a freezing theory, that the pendency of a lawsuit does, in fact, have an injunctive effect, as it were, against the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.100" offset="13908957">It no longer enjoys liberty to regulate the public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.485" offset="13926512">And thirdly and finally... I think this is very important... what the Ninth Circuit concluded, and what we've heard today, is that Congress violated the separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.692" offset="13967367">It directed courts how to decide a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.144" offset="13985130">Fair reading of this, including the language that hurts me the most, "determines and directs", isn't language that Congress uses in addresses the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.434" offset="14022329">It uses the word "directs" throughout this statute when it's talking to those of us who have to listen... the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.273" offset="14057646">It wasn't directing a decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3515.315" offset="14205813">But this Court has been troubled if there is an effort by Congress to actually step in and to direct: John Smith shall win this particular adjudication.</text>
