            <text syncTime="1255.104" offset="5172121">This Court has frequently looked to history and tradition in its interpretation of the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.212" offset="5204617">Indeed, it was Justice Brennan who said that our interpretation in this area must be guided by history, and by the understanding of the founding fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.143" offset="5252369">Rabbi Gutterman's invocation and benediction are a far cry from practices that the founding fathers meant to stop by means of the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.421" offset="5297404">To the contrary, the acknowledgement of God, the invocation of God's blessing, the expression of thanks of the Nation to God, are practices that are as old and enduring as the republic itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3270.718" offset="13234658">Your Honor, under either analysis, I think that the primary purpose and effect in this case, of the school department's practice, is to advance religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.416" offset="13273424">There is nothing in the agreed statement of facts that was submitted to the court below that suggests the Government's purpose in including prayer in part of the school's commencement exercises, and not including them in other of the school's commencement exercises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.521" offset="13333819">The Government makes the argument that by including prayer they are merely acknowledging religious tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.502" offset="13361717">However, this Court has always recognized the fact that prayer is the... is inherently religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.235" offset="13392646">It's not simply a passive acknowledgement, as the display of a nativity scene, or the display or a menorah may, in some circumstances, be passive acknowledgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.417" offset="13433397">It is active.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.243" offset="13436741">It is worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.322" offset="13441025">To say that any vocal prayer is merely an acknowledgement of religious traditions is to diminish the value of that prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.460" offset="13477597">Furthermore, I don't think that it is possible to devise a nonsectarian prayer that covers all people and all religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.783" offset="13514900">This country has become so much more diverse than it was when it was founded in terms of the religious beliefs of its citizens that it is virtually impossible to devise a prayer which encompasses the beliefs of all of those citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.479" offset="13577698">With regard to the effect of including a prayer, as I stated earlier, the message that must be given by public school teachers who have chosen a particular clergyperson and have brought him into a public school function to deliver a prayer is that the public school is... at the very least... saying that prayer is a preferred practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.860" offset="13663171">And by doing so, they are giving a message to nonadherents and nonbelievers that their religious beliefs are not as important, that they are outsiders, and that the public school system does not belong to them in the same way that it belongs to believers.</text>
