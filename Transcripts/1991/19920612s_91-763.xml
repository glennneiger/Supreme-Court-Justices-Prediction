            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91126">The second case I have to announce is No. 91-763, Republic of Argentina versus Weltover.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.238" offset="128011">That case is here on petitioner for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.163" offset="155701">As part of a plan to stabilize its currency the petitioner, Republic of Argentina, issued bonds called "Bonods" which provided for repayment in United States dollars through transfer on the market in several cities including New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.225" offset="219962">At the time the Bonods began to mature, Argentina lack sufficient foreign exchange to retire them and it, therefore, unilaterally extended the time for repayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.784" offset="262176">Respondent, bond holders, two Panamanian corporations, and a Swiss bank declined to accept the rescheduling of the debt and insisted on immediate repayment in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.667" offset="305748">When Argentina refused, respondents brought this breach of contract action in the District Court which denied Argentina's motion to dismiss on grounds of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.310" offset="344305">The Court of Appeals affirmed ruling that the District Court had jurisdiction under the commercial exception of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 which subjects foreign states to suit in United States courts for actions taken "in connection with a commercial activity" if such acts "have a direct affect in the United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="86.459" offset="436883">In an opinion filed today, we affirm that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.851" offset="450466">In light of the established meaning of the term, commercial, under the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity which the statute codifies, we conclude that when a foreign government acts not as regulator of the market, but in the manner of a private player within the market, its actions are commercial within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.387" offset="524654">Moreover, because the statute provides that the commercial character of an Act is to be determined by reference to its nature rather than its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.838" offset="562375">The precise question is whether the government's particular actions, whatever the motive behind it might have been, are the type of actions by which a private party engages in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.255" offset="600096">Here, the Bonods are, in almost all respects, garden-variety debt instruments and even when they are considered in full context, there is nothing about their issuance that is not analogous to a private commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.553" offset="645235">Accordingly, we conclude that the issuance of the Bonods was a commercial activity within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.269" offset="668119">As to whether that commercial activity had a direct effect in the United States as the statute requires, since New York was the place of performance for Argentina?s contractual obligations, the rescheduling of those obligations necessarily had a direct effect in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.573" offset="729350">Money that was supposed to have been delivered to a New York bank was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.881" offset="746590">We reject the argument that the direct effect requirement cannot be satisfied where the plaintiffs are all foreign corporations with no other connections to this country, and we also reject the argument that the direct effect must be substantial as opposed to merely more than de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.657" offset="805732">These limitations simply do not appear in the text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.220" offset="819942">For these reasons, there was jurisdiction over respondent's suit and we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.846" offset="838437">The decision is unanimous.</text>
