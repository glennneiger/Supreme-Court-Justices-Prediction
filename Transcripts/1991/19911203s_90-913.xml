            <text syncTime="12.691" offset="141574">These two cases come to us on cross-petitions for certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.959" offset="174697">They arise out of two separate administrative proceedings brought by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System against a Bank Holding Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.710" offset="209701">In No. 90-913, there is a challenge to the Court of Appeals holding that the Bankruptcy Court had jurisdiction to enjoin proceedings challenging the Board's so-called source of strength regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.217" offset="267693">And the cross-petition challenges that court's holding that the Bankruptcy Court did not have jurisdiction to enjoin an administrative proceeding alleging a violation of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.312" offset="316072">I am sure all of this is perfectly clear to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.614" offset="325267">Based on our interpretation of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act in the relevant precedents, we hold that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin either proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.658" offset="369466">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in one case and affirmed in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.403" offset="392454">Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
