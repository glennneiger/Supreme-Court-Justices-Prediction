            <text syncTime="49.064" offset="343347">This case presents the question, under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, whether a county must submit for preclearance a transfer of power away from an individual county commissioner to either a white majority county commission or an official appointed by that county commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.077" offset="427357">We contend that these changes must be submitted, because they affect the power of voters to elect commissioners who can respond to citizens' wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.452" offset="472914">In Etowah County, this transfer occurred immediately after the election of Lawrence Presley, the first black county commissioner in the county's history, and therefore diminished the power of that black county commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.378" offset="532578">This, in turn, affected the power of the black voters in his district to control roadwork in their particular district.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.150" offset="563611">In the South, roads have traditionally been the main concern of county commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.804" offset="586286">The road commissioner's responsiveness to his constituents is judged by how well he handles their complaints and concerns about the roadwork.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.061" offset="7207282">It was a rule which specifically focused on what happens to somebody who runs for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.529" offset="7225149">Justice Powell in his dissent there indicated he thought it wasn't a change in election laws because it was a rule that was passed through a personnel aspect of a school board, but since it was a rule that said, here's what happens to you when you run for office, it's certainly consistent with the line I've drawn to say Dougherty County affects voting, but transfers of authority don't affect voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.426" offset="7308741">Transfers of authority instead, we believe, should be governed not by section 5 with its particular standards and procedures but by the conventional remedies for other kinds of discrimination, if they are discriminatory, which is suits under the Fourteenth Amendment, in the Civil Rights Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.910" offset="7414694">Now, in section 5, what Congress created was a unique form of Federal administrative review of State and local laws with an unusually stringent substantive test, and I think it's this test that's kind of gotten lost in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.300" offset="7468297">It certainly isn't addressed by any of the parties on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.037" offset="7483239">That test is an effects test which says that any retrogressive impact caused by a change... impact on the position of minorities in the community and their political power... is enough to invalidate the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.595" offset="7533394">Now, that's pretty strong medicine when we have Federal administrators applying a test of that sort, but what Congress says is we're going to have this kind of mechanism, but it's going to apply only to a particular discrete category of changes... changes in the way elections are conducted, things that happen on election day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.557" offset="7605283">That, after all, is what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.009" offset="7615105">It says, standards, practices and procedures with respect to voting, it doesn't say, anything that affects power in the Government, and this limitation is perfectly sensible if you look back at what it was that led Congress to single out a minority of political jurisdictions in this country and subject them to special regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.554" offset="7689293">These were jurisdictions which back in the '60's had large numbers of minority residents who weren't registered to vote, so the problem that existed was one with respect to the conduct of elections and voting, and Congress addressed that problem in two ways in the Voting Rights Act in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.766" offset="7762122">First, for these specific jurisdictions it suspended all literacy tests and other devices that were preventing people from registering to vote, and then in section 5 what it did is it essentially froze in place the balance of the electoral system that those jurisdictions had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.477" offset="7828996">It said, you... we're going to take away your literacy tests and other devices, and the rest of the stuff has to stay the same, with one proviso, which was if the jurisdiction could come forward and affirmatively prove that there... that a change would be at least neutral in its impact on the political influence of minorities, then that change could go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.522" offset="7905169">Now, nothing in that sequence of events, and nothing in the actual legislative record, not one word cited by anybody here, suggests that Congress intended this... this freezing effect and this drastic kind of Federal administrative review to extend beyond things that directly relate to what happens in elections.</text>

            <text syncTime="2482.889" offset="10078661">--Well, let me return for a moment, if I might, to how this would get decided under the substantive standard in section 5, which is a point that I think is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.143" offset="10107605">This effects test does not limit Federal interference to situations of actual, intentional discrimination, which may have been the case in that Hardy v. Wallace example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.398" offset="10144699">What it does if you apply it to transfers of power is, it prevents power from being transferred for whatever reason from an official who is subject to greater minority influence and control to an official with less minority influence and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.158" offset="10199660">The only way that I can imagine that being applied is... is to have a rule that says, if you've got an official over here with a nigh percentage of minority constituents and an official over here with fewer, you simply cannot move power, under that effects test, from the one official to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.418" offset="10256712">That is, in fact, what you would have to do if you tried to apply that kind of substantive standard, which was designed for election procedures, in this much broader context of transfers of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.391" offset="10300597">So, for example, just to give an example, if a State had an existing arrangement under which total control over the creation of school curricula was delegated to local school districts and the State then, for its own good and legitimate reasons, decided to take back a chunk of that power and say... tell all the school districts they have to teach science in all 4 years of high school, or just set a State curriculum in the science area, that would be the transfer of a chunk of authority over school curricula from local officials subject to local control to the State level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.030" offset="10439151">The appellant's theory is not only that that would have to be precleared... indeed, every time the State changed whatever curricula requirements it has it would have to be precleared... it would not only have to be precleared, but in every case where the local school district has more black residents than the State as a whole, it would be prohibited from making that change, because it would have the effect of transferring influence over that policy decision from a smaller group of people where blacks may predominate to a larger group of people... the population of the whole State... where blacks don't predominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.584" offset="10565375">So unless you're going to ignore the substantive test that Congress set out in section 5, you're going to end up with... with results which are just so far beyond what Congress could have imagined it was doing that they call into question the entire statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.777" offset="10630158">Going back just for a moment to the issue of the frequency with which this happens, the school example, I think, makes it clear that you're going to have a huge number of cases in which State government will transfer authority back and forth between the State level and the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.691" offset="10709779">Any time a State law addresses local government, what they're doing is, they're saying you should zone in this way, don't zone in this way, run your schools this way, you're allowed to have cable television in your county or you're not... those kinds of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.351" offset="10760457">All of that is a transfer of decision making authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.302" offset="10772264">It all may be phrased in different ways, but ultimately if you're going to have a principle like this you're going to have a huge number of laws like that, and of course, at the local level the number of times that a city council may tell the mayor what to do, or the county commissioners may divide up their delegated executive functions in Etowah County or Russell County are going to... are going to be nearly infinite, and all of those things would then be subject to this effects test and to a preclearance process which is going to change the way government is really conducted in these jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.822" offset="10890338">You're going to have to prepare this package of stuff, send it in and wait 60 days for almost every law that gets passed in order to be... be confident that you're not going to be subject to legal challenge at some later date.</text>

            <text syncTime="2738.918" offset="11102766">I do think that the constitutional claim and perhaps the title VI claim may be open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.670" offset="11117708">I don't think the section 2 claim is open, and I... and I think it's pretty likely that the Fifteenth Amendment claim doesn't work, but there is a Fourteenth Amendment claim for sure, and that was pleaded from the beginning, and the Court left that open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.126" offset="11155533">Let me just make... make one final point about this question of how many things would be subject to legal challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.180" offset="11179775">There is no statute of limitations in section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.333" offset="11192418">If something is done that should have been precleared and isn't, then it can be challenged at any time thereafter, and if we look at how many things might be viewed as involving some kind of transfer of authority... and we have appellants here saying every budget that's ever passed could be viewed in that way and should be precleared... then we have to think about how many things have been done in these jurisdictions since 1965 that now would be called into legal jeopardy if appellants' and the Government's interpretation of the statute were accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.687" offset="11309760">Essentially, you'd have utter chaos in these nine States and part of seven others that have been operating under this statute for these years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.674" offset="11341734">Whole departments of State government have been created since 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.292" offset="11356258">Money has been shifted and power has been shifted in innumerable ways as government has evolved, naturally, over that period of time, and no one would have any idea what the law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.683" offset="11397845">You... you'd spend years sorting all that out in court as people tried to figure out, does this particular law in some way represent a redistribution of authority different from that in effect on November 1, 1964?</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.491" offset="11449045">So it's not just a question of prospectively how much would have to be reviewed and whether the Justice Department could really do any good, looking at this mountain of tens of thousands of things they would receive every day, but going backwards you would basically have the settled expectations of everybody in those jurisdictions upset for a considerable period of years to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.987" offset="11526994">Now, in view of all this, it seems clear to us that Congress, whatever its concern about voting rights in 1965, couldn't have intended to transform the Justice Department into an administrative overseer of whole chunks of substantive legislation and other things that in some way could be viewed as affecting the authority of officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.901" offset="11610691">As Justice Powell pointed out in that dissent in Dougherty that we discussed, Justice... I was discussing with Justice Blackmun, there is an enormous intrusion here on State government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.507" offset="11657084">Whenever you have a Federal review, administrative review of State statutes, but at least the section 5 intrusion is tempered by the fact that it's limited to a discrete area of law, voting laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.863" offset="11702537">At this point, that whole limitation would be basically lost, and you would have the Federal Government looking at almost everything the State's doing and telling it whether it can go ahead or has to file a lawsuit to get permission to go ahead, and as I suggested before, I think that it's... it's very unlikely that the Justice Department would find that needle in a haystack if there was one, it would be able to say look, here out of this 20,000 we got today, these two don't look too good to us, because maybe they're doing it for racist motives and we're going... we're going to tell them not to do those two.</text>
