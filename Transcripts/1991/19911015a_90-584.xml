            <text syncTime="11.222" offset="190308">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.776" offset="208489">This case presents the issue whether land-based maritime employees, specifically included in the coverage of the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act, nonetheless are entitled to go to a jury trial to determine their alleged status as Jones Act seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.619" offset="271915">The facts of this case are very straightforward, as it comes to this Court after reversal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals of a summary judgment issued by the District Court of the Southern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.927" offset="317159">The respondent, Bryon Gizoni, is a rigger and rigger foreman for petitioner, our client, Southwest Marine.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.016" offset="349446">One day while working on a floating platform, a platform commonly used for ship repair work and devoid of navigational qualities, Gizoni was injured when his foot went through a hole in the platform.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.941" offset="405244">Typical of any ship repair person, Gizoni filed for an obtained Longshore Act benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.512" offset="431471">In fact, he obtained in excess of &lt;eighteen thousand dollars &gt; [ = $ 18,000] worth of benefits, which he then used as he went out forward, not only to take care of his medical needs, but we assume, to bring a Jones Act claim, seeking to get an even bigger recovery by ignoring the administrative process and invoking the full processes of the Federal court system, including the use of a jury to determine his alleged seaman status and his Jones Act claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.913" offset="541080">What makes Gizoni's Jones Act claim peculiar and bizarre is that he is land based.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.602" offset="571800">He works strictly in San Diego Harbor and, by stipulation, is a ship repairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.291" offset="606595">Yet with the conviction that just about any ship repairman can also make out a Jones Act claim, regardless of congressional intent--</text>

            <text syncTime="146.738" offset="732401">However, the problem is that the right to have the offset is judicially created.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.309" offset="750687">It is not provided in the Jones Act, and as a result, unfortunately, of what has occurred over the years with regard to the ambiguity as to whether or not one is in fact a Jones Act seaperson.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.915" offset="789139">In fact, there is language in the Longshore Act, which is specifically section 3(e), which provides for a credit in the event one mistakenly gets payments under the Jones Act or some other State compensation form of coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.340" offset="854759">Essentially what has happened here, Justice Stevens and members of the Court is this: in 1927, when the Longshore Act was passed, this was the first time in which Congress had an opportunity to deal with the void which had been created in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.302" offset="926648">That is to say, to deal with the stevedores and longshoring people.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.753" offset="944411">And over the years what happened unfortunately was that there was a recognition through the situs test, as opposed to the status test which was developed in 1972, that essentially what would happen is that a person could walk in or out of coverage under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.965" offset="1013270">In fact, this Court stretched to the ultimate before the passage of the Longshore Act to try and bring stevedores within the Jones Act, simply to avoid this problem of coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.587" offset="1051826">But what happened was the Congress took the baton and started roll... running with it, if you will, and determined essentially, that it would set forth a law in which it could provide coverage for those who were injured upon navigational waters who were nonsea people and additionally, by the passage of the 1972 amendments, in essence, were able to cover those who were on the adjoining areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.852" offset="1148793">--Well, Mr. Tichy, the plain language of the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act excludes from coverage any repairman who is a member of a crew of any vessel, and it seems to me that your position just reads that right out of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.302" offset="1242625">You know, I wrestled with the arguments that were raised by the Solicitor, as well as by Mr. Gizoni's counsel, and I guess the way that you have to deal with the issue that you raise is you have to go back to the statute and you look at the language which Congress used.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.394" offset="1306991">Congress divided those who were maritime employees into two types, and the unique language they used was shall be included, and shall not be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.071" offset="1361743">We are talking about fundamental Aristotelian logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.554" offset="1371670">They didn't use words other than nonincluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.523" offset="1383477">They said, included are A, B, C, and D... which by the way, in this case includes harbor workers, which are a specifically designed category of maritime employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.698" offset="1436244">And then Congress went one step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.984" offset="1445335">Congress said, look, we are not simply covering harbor workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.869" offset="1464875">We are going to specifically cover those who are ship repair persons, and so they specifically included that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.630" offset="6935960">And it says, tolling provision: where recovery is denied to any person in a suit brought at law or an admiralty... and the Jones Act is law and maintenance and cure are admiralty... to recover damages in respect of injury or death on the ground that such person was an employee and that the defendant was an employer within the meaning of this act, and that such employer had secured compensation to such employee under this act, the limitation of time prescribed in subdivision (a) shall begin to run only from the date of termination of such suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1978.673" offset="8060166">I would say that in one way Wilander liberalized the situation, and in another way it restricted the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.410" offset="8091095">It restricted it by making it a combined issue of fact and law rather than just fact; but it, by getting rid of the aid to navigation test, that probably swung open the biggest door that has ever been swung open since the courts have been defining seaman status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.323" offset="8166746">So I think Wilander ultimately makes it a lot easier to prove seaman status, because you had so many cases where people were performing functions on vessels and the vessel had no transportation function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.381" offset="8218991">The vessel was a dredge or used to pump waste oil or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.083" offset="8233724">So I think that Wilander opened it up quite a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.785" offset="8252532">There is also an interesting sentence in Wilander that directly addresses the issue that is raised for review in this case, and that's, should people's status be determined by their occupation, or should their remedy be determined by their occupation?</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.346" offset="8322853">And in Wilander it says it is not the employee's particular job that is determinative, but the employee's connection to a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.618" offset="8355872">And that's Mr. Gizoni's position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.839" offset="8372800">As far as making seaman status a factual issue, Wilander creates some bounds for it, but it still, I think, leaves it pretty wide open because it says, if reasonable persons, applying the proper legal standard could differ as to whether the employee was a member of the crew, it was a question for the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2160.120" offset="8785952">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.337" offset="8786788">There is another situation where the law has determined vessel status, and that is, if you are using a barge to move things around in a shipyard or some other location, the barge will probably qualify as a vessel in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.963" offset="8837257">Some shipyards and maritime employers take barges and they fasten them all to the dock and they tie up vessels against the outboard side of the barge and they use the barge as a dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.806" offset="8896607">And the courts have held that if you are using a barge for a dock, then the barge does not become a vessel in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.876" offset="8920953">So there are certain scenarios where the court has said, this is just not a vessel in navigation for Jones Act purposes, and I'm not saying that those should be thrown to the jury every time and let the jury overturn these legal decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.720" offset="8984274">But I agree with the language in Wilander that when reasonable minds can differ, then it's a question that should go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.492" offset="9015412">I want to point out something else about how ridiculous this occupation test is if you want to read it literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.431" offset="9055118">And that is, the Longshore Act is extended to the outer continental shelf by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and the occupations enumerated in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act are workers involved in exploring, developing, removing, or transporting natural resources of the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.380" offset="9150935">So if we are going to devise a statutory occupational test, then I guess every member of a crew boat that takes workers offshore, every kind of vessel used in this offshore oil drilling and exploration and transportation would fall under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.591" offset="9223764">Even some of the oil companies have proposed removing oil from fixed platforms with oil tankers and shipping the oil away from the platform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.149" offset="9262008">So if we are going to be literal on the occupation, then all those tanker crews that are pumping oil off the outer continental shelf are going to have to first submit themselves to the Department of Labor for a finding of seaman status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.874" offset="9312894">That's why the occupational test is too unreasonable to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.842" offset="9332747">The Court has made a similar ruling or a ruling in a case similar to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.980" offset="9353332">It is a footnote in Gray v. Herb's Welding which dealt with longshore jurisdiction versus State workers' compensation jurisdiction for the first 3 miles offshore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.953" offset="9401293">And there is a footnote by the Supreme Court that says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.405" offset="9411010">"Floating structures have been treated as vessels by lower courts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.624" offset="9423967">"Workers on them, unlike workers on fixed platforms, enjoy the same remedies as workers on ships. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.011" offset="9449462">So I think there is some precedent that says that there is no Longshore Act exclusion from people in those occupations seeking seaman status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.652" offset="9500035">Something that's an interesting comparison that has come into my own mind with regard to your Wilander case is virtually every shipyard has a paint barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.745" offset="9560431">That's a barge that has scaffolding permanently mounted on it that is moved all around the shipyard to paint the offshore side of each vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.517" offset="9595539">And I would think it unusual to have a system where an individual painting a fixed oil rig from a boat could have seaman status, but a man painting a vessel from a floating barge that moves around the shipyard could not seek seaman status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.460" offset="9663249">In a lot of these cases that were decided by the Supreme Court in the fifties, the individuals very arguably had harbor worker status rather than Jones Act, but they were still given the right to have these issues determined by the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.725" offset="9748303">The barge is a vessel in navigation for purposes of the Jones Act, and that's stated in the Norton v. Warner case and it's stated in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.664" offset="9784039">It is defined as any contrivance capable of transportation on water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.866" offset="9800862">The Longshore Act provides some immunity to shipyards that I am going to concede them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.673" offset="9844120">If the person is not a member of the vessel crew, the '84 amendments did away with the dual-capacity doctrine, where the shipyard has a dual capacity as vessel owner in addition to its capacity as the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.849" offset="9904829">So when vessels are in the yard for repair, the shipyard repairman cannot claim that the shipyard is owner pro hac vice of the vessel being repaired and then sue the shipyard in a second capacity as owner pro hac vice of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.609" offset="9967836">But for the shipyard to get that immunity, there has to be a showing that the worker is covered by the Longshore Act and not a member of the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.481" offset="10007333">I have heard the term "land based" bantered around a lot in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.308" offset="10058638">Whether a person is land based or not I don't think determines the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.926" offset="10077133">There are many people that are land... that don't sleep on the vessel, that are land based: ferry boat operators, tour boat operators, tugboat operators in a harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.984" offset="10125407">Shipyards want to force Jones Act employees into the Longshore Act, and the test they want to use is, workers that are arguably covered by the Longshore Act should have to go to the Department of Labor first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.445" offset="10195206">And that raises a real interesting question as to who makes this determination as to who is arguably covered by the Longshore Act, who then has to go to the Department of Labor, because according to the shipyards, the tugboat operators and captains are arguably covered by the Longshore Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2543.833" offset="10320803">Let me begin by saying a word about this primary jurisdiction point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.904" offset="10341074">We see no basis in the Longshore Act, including its 1972 amendments or the Jones Act for concluding that Congress intended to remit the determination of seaman status to the special expertise of the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.330" offset="10410769">Juries have been making that determination under the Jones Act since 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.668" offset="10432084">Federal courts sitting in admiralty have been making that determination since long before that, and in fact, we think a provision of the Longshore Act refutes the primary jurisdiction argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.243" offset="10486419">Section 13(d), 33 U.S.C. 913(d) tolls the statute of limitations under the Longshore Act, in the event that a suit is brought at law or in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.920" offset="10545142">We think if the Secretary were meant to have primary jurisdiction, there would be no reason to have a tolling provision, certainly not a perfectly general tolling provision such as 13(d).</text>

            <text syncTime="2803.095" offset="11357760">We think it is quite clear from the structure of the statute that Section 2(3) defines a very broad category of maritime employee and then cuts out various subcategories, including a master or member of a vessel.</text>
