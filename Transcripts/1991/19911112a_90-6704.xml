            <label>Mr. Bernard J. O'Donnell</label>
            <text syncTime="9.272" offset="189113">Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.891" offset="199667">This case presents a very narrow issue; may States equate speech or association entitled to protection under the First Amendment with character evidence, and thereby enhance a criminal sentence, particularly so as to impose a sentence of death, when those beliefs are unrelated to the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.019" offset="276153">As Delaware concedes in its brief, the petitioner, David Dawson, invokes two traditional First Amendment precepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.375" offset="309590">First, that criminal penalties can never be imposed nor aggravated because of an individual's beliefs; and secondly, that Government, here in the form of the sentencing jury, must always remain value or content neutral within the realm of a person's beliefs or views.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.968" offset="371971">Delaware concedes that while it could not have made constitutionally protected belief a statutory aggravating circumstance, it instead argues the radical proposition that the traditional First Amendment constraints against governmental-viewpoint punishment are not applicable to the highly-discretionary, weighing stage of a death penalty proceeding in order to determine whether a particular... particular defendant should live or die.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.535" offset="474162">This Court, however, has made it clear that States, in inflicting punishment... particularly in inflicting the penalty of death... may not attach the aggravating label to factors that are constitutionally impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.062" offset="536333">Delaware has done just that in this case.</text>

AA... now, I guess if you say that a person can't be sentenced on the basis of his membership, I guess you would logically have to say he shouldn't be sentenced because of his nonmembership either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.359" offset="13977482">But doesn't that happen every time somebody who doesn't belong to AA is sentenced?</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.645" offset="13994619">I mean your client can come in and say I'm a member of AA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.763" offset="14007157">And this other fellow is being punished because he's a nonmember of AA.</text>
