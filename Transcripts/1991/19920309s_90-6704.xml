            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90845">I have the dispositions of the Court to announce in two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.656" offset="109444">The first one is Dawson against Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.558" offset="125013">After escaping with three other inmates from the Delaware Correctional Center, the petitioner here, David Dawson, murdered Mrs. Madeline Kisner at her home.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.186" offset="167541">Police officers apprehended him early the next morning while performing a house-to-house search.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.045" offset="190946">A jury convicted him of first degree murder and other related crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.327" offset="208083">The Trial Court then conducted a penalty hearing before the jury to determine whether Dawson should be sentenced to death for the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.755" offset="245803">At the penalty hearing, the prosecution introduced evidence that Dawson had tattooed the words Aryan Brotherhood on his hand and also read to the jury the following stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.308" offset="296063">The Aryan Brotherhood refers to a white racist prison gang that began in the 1960s in California in response to other gangs of racial minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.806" offset="338068">Separate gangs calling themselves the Aryan Brotherhood now exists in many state prisons including Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.153" offset="367429">At the conclusion of the hearing, the jury found that the aggravating evidence against Dawson outweighed the mitigating evidence and made a binding recommendation that Dawson be sentenced to death, and the Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed the conviction and the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.133" offset="439318">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that the admission of the evidence regarding Dawson's membership in the Aryan Brotherhood violated his rights under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.604" offset="481219">Although the Constitution does not erect any automatic barrier to the admission at sentencing of evidence concerning one's beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.832" offset="514133">We have concluded that the narrowness of the stipulation used in this case left the Aryan Brotherhood evidence totally without relevance to Dawson's sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.708" offset="553630">As a result of its reliance on the narrow stipulation, the prosecution failed to prove anything more than Dawson's abstract racist beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.568" offset="593023">We leave for the Supreme Court of Delaware the question of whether the First Amendment violation in this case was harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.333" offset="620086">Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion and Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
