            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="154288">We'll hear argument next in No. 90-1745, United States v. Richard Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.122" offset="190755">You may proceed, Ms. Wax.</text>

          <turn speaker="amy_l_wax" startTime="60.222" stopTime="191.875">
            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text syncTime="60.222" offset="395137">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.240" offset="407153">Under the sentencing credit statute codified at 18 U.S.C. 3585, which Congress enacted as part of the Sentencing Reform Act, a defendant is entitled to credit against a Federal sentence for certain periods he has spent in official detention before he begins to serve his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.737" offset="485207">The question in this case is whether the task of determining the amount of credit that is due against a defendant's sentence, that is the technical calculation of the precise number of days the defendant has left to serve on his sentence, is to be performed by the district court at sentencing or by the Attorney General through the Bureau of Prisons once the sentence begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.500" offset="572247">Here the district court refused to award respondent credit against his 8-year Federal sentence for approximately 14 months that he spent in State custody before his sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.839" offset="613625">The Sixth Circuit reversed that decision, holding that the award of sentencing credit under the 1984 statute is the exclusive province of the sentencing court, which is to assign the credit at sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.564" offset="660541">Although respondent received credit for virtually the same period against a subsequent State sentence after he was sentenced in Federal court, the court of appeals nonetheless directed the district court to give him credit for that period against his Federal sentence as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.193" offset="723026">In effect, the court ruled that not only must the sentencing court decide what sentence to give the offender, but it must also take on what is essentially an administrative ministerial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.933" offset="769942">That is the arithmetical task of figuring out the exact date an offender will finish serving his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.820" offset="797527">In the Government's view, the Sixth Circuit was wrong to conclude that the statute makes this task part of sentencing, that is a function to be performed exclusively by the sentencing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.628" offset="840786">It is the Bureau of Prisons, and not the sentencing court, that has exclusive authority to calculate sentencing credit, a function that BOP has carried out for 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.318" offset="883522">There is no reason to believe that Congress decided to change the status quo and to discard the preexisting administrative framework in the Sentencing Reform Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.875" offset="921766">It did change... delete the language, saying that the Attorney General would determine the credit, though, didn't they?</text>

            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>

            <text syncTime="199.512" offset="952277">And the reason why it did is something of a mystery.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.831" offset="965547">We think the common sense explanation is that the BOP's role in this regard was so well-entrenched, they'd been doing it for so long, that Congress did not advert to the question of who is to perform the function, they just assumed that BOP would.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="219.293" offset="1031375">Well, I think the most logical reading of a change in the statute like that, where it used to say the Attorney General will determine it and now it doesn't say that is that Congress no longer meant for the Attorney General to determine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.000" offset="1082262">That's not to say it's the only reading, but certainly, that's the first inference one would draw.</text>

            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text syncTime="237.920" offset="1105877">Your Honor, this Court has stated that a change in language is just some evidence of a change in meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.974" offset="1130118">It is not dispositive of an intent to change meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.676" offset="1144956">And this Court most recently noted in McElroy v. United States, where it found that a change in language did not betoken a change in meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.199" offset="1179019">It said the inference from a change in language to a change in intent is only a workable rule of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.520" offset="1204306">It is not an infallible guide to legislative intent, and it cannot overcome more persuasive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.506" offset="1228234">And the Government's point in this case is that there is more persuasive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.660" offset="1244848">There is an abundance of evidence in the language, the history, the purposes of the sentencing credit provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.581" offset="1272538">In particular, in the Sentence Reform Act as a whole, the Congress did not intend to alter the status quo that it did not transfer authority from BOP to the sentencing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.889" offset="1317782">And just to begin, there are three specific features of section 3585 itself that support our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.895" offset="1349860">And just to summarize them, first of all, the statute uses the past tense in a way that indicates that the award of sentencing credit is to take place some time after sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.785" offset="1401374">The second aspect of the statute is--</text>

            <text syncTime="342.052" offset="1522477">--Your Honor, we think that our view has support from the history of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.122" offset="1538673">The predecessor provision, section 3568, that's where this language, this phrasing, is borrowed from.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.943" offset="1566050">It's lifted right from 3568.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.895" offset="1573782">Now under 3568, that statute explicitly said that the Attorney General awards credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.799" offset="1597397">And therefore, we take the parallel language to essentially have the same significance as it had under the predecessor, which is that there's sentencing, and then when the person begins to serve his sentence, there's an assignment of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.690" offset="1652985">We think the parallelism is what's appropriate.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="376.309" offset="1659464">But the difference is you don't identify the person in the present statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.761" offset="1673256">What's wrong with reading the statute this way?</text>
            <text syncTime="382.213" offset="1683078">The statute requires that somebody make this calculation, that at the sentencing time, the judge just says, is there going to be any fight about the credit time.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.651" offset="1712858">And if everybody says no, it's all, you've just got so much time in jail, then he could say to the attorney, well, you go ahead and compute it, then, and we'll enter the sentence plus whatever time you... couldn't he delegate that authority in cases when there's no dispute under your opponent's reading of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="404.328" offset="1771581">And then just say, if there is a dispute, I ought to resolve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.363" offset="1783702">It shouldn't be resolved... while lawyers are here to write it out, it shouldn't be resolved in the prison setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="546.768" offset="2341259">He was arrested some time later by State authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.388" offset="2355784">His appeal bond was revoked, a detainer was filed by Federal authorities, but he remained in State custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.892" offset="2381801">In fact, he remained and wasn't sent out on bail because there was a detainer, for a number of months... I think 4 or 5 months... before the State charges were finally dropped and he was turned over to the Federal authorities, and his sentencing clock began to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.219" offset="2443137">Now under the statute, he would be entitled, under BOP's interpretation, to credit for the number of months that he spent in State custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.415" offset="2931940">Our argument... what you're talking about here is essentially a system of shared jurisdiction over sentencing, because in effect the court can calculate to a date certain the amount of credit due for anything that goes before sentencing, but it can't do anything like that for a period that comes after sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.828" offset="3005501">In effect, it has to designate the Attorney General to do that for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.145" offset="3110827">They completely restructured the system, and they didn't give us one iota of guidance as to how the system was actually going to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.607" offset="3184701">If you look at some of the State statutes, interestingly enough, and there are a number of States that do allocate responsibility for presentence time to the court, sentencing credit, and postsentence time to the correctional authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.700" offset="3241021">A lot... this is spelled out in explicit detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.485" offset="3256172">I mean this is... it's nothing like this statute which just uses the passive voice, doesn't give us a hint that there are to be two entities instead of one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.103" offset="5654631">But interestingly, the legislative history says a lot about section 3585 and the other changes that were introduced into section 3585.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.459" offset="5692038">The change, for example... the expansion of the scope of the custody for which credit was available, for example, that was remarked upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.398" offset="5727878">The change in the day that the sentence commences, that was also spoken about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.386" offset="5747731">The fact that they added this double credit language which hadn't previously appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.990" offset="5770197">Congress commented on that, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.342" offset="5779601">And in the Sentencing Reform Act legislative history as a whole, Congress goes on and on about the shortcomings of the previous way of doing sentencing and all of the ways in which those shortcomings are to be remedied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.334" offset="5835607">And we have nothing about shortcomings at all here, no indication that there was a problem to be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.321" offset="5867477">Now, respondent has several arguments against our position, and all of them are easily answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.760" offset="5897256">The main thrust of his argument appears to be that in sentencing reform, Congress somehow wanted to place all decisions bearing on the length of the sentence, including the release date, in the hands of the court in order to achieve uniformity and consistency in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.555" offset="5976459">Now, the problem with this argument is that it confuses control over the total length of the sentence with control over the actual release date of an individual offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.648" offset="6028809">That argument, it essentially confuses passing sentence with deciding how much of the sentence is left to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.587" offset="6068619">It's important to realize that having the sentencing court fix the actual release date in fact subverts rather than serves the goals of uniformity and consistency in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.596" offset="6120655">Now the reason for that is that if the release date is fixed at sentencing, we necessarily have to ignore any periods of detention for which an individual would be eligible for credit under 3585 that come after sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.023" offset="6178334">Because if we take those periods into account, by definition we're going to be moving the release date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.027" offset="6206337">Now if we don't take them into account, it means that similar offenders will in fact spend different periods of time in jail depending on whether their Federal sentence starts right away or it starts after a period of detention or at some later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.084" offset="6262552">And it means that the court will not be able to control the amount of time an individual spends behind bars for the very same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.356" offset="6291705">Some individuals will spend an intervening period of detention that won't have any effect on their release date and other individuals won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.027" offset="6322321">So the bottom line is that it's impossible for a court to fix both the duration of the sentence, if we take section 3585 and sentencing credit seriously, and the release date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.568" offset="6368505">Congress certainly, I think, from a reading of the legislative history, didn't care about the release date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.406" offset="6391911">It cared about how long an individual was going to be behind bars for that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.559" offset="6416466">And that means that we have to change the release date to account for intervening detention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.789" offset="7113413">I'm sure Ms. Wax and I both will be more than happy to provide supplemental briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.443" offset="7135983">The... our position, the position of the court of appeals was that Congress in reforming sentencing in Federal courts intended for the district courts to make a determination on jail credit for a sentenced individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.516" offset="7192303">It's our position that that approach is not only more logical and workable than the approach presented by the Attorney General, but it is more consistent with congressional intent as expressed in the legislative history and in the enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.943" offset="7249981">I think in order to understand how it's more logical and sensical, it might be helpful if I can relay to the Court how I would envision this operating under our proposal and then how I would envision this operating under the Government's proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.453" offset="7312048">The process would start out the same in either event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.922" offset="7321975">An individual would commit an offense, there would be an arrest by somebody, either Federal or State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.540" offset="7340365">There would be a determination as to detention or release pretrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.258" offset="7355307">At some point there would come a determination appeal to... either by a guilty plea or by condition by at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.114" offset="7390729">And at that point the two systems would begin to diverge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.299" offset="7403477">Under the proposal that we have, the next thing that would occur would be a presentence investigation and report prepared by a probation officer under the direction of the court with the assistance and involvement of both parties, both the defendant and the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.226" offset="7463140">That presentence report would include the prior record of the individual, including any pending charges, any pending sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.749" offset="7489263">It would include a report to the court as to any prior incarceration or confinement of the defendant, whether or not he was in custody for any or all the portion of the time of the charge until disposition of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.739" offset="7545165">It would also include a calculation of the appropriate guideline sentence, a recommendation of what the guideline sentence should be, a recommendation as to whether or not there are any grounds for departure above or below the applicable guideline range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.566" offset="7596469">And under our proposal, the recommendation also as to what amount of jail credit the person is entitled to, and if there are other sentences pending or imposed unserved, a recommendation as to whether or not the current sentence should be concurrent or consecutive to any prior sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.444" offset="7668045">At that point, then, this presentence report would be distributed to the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.895" offset="7685808">If there was any objection about any of those matters in the presentence report, both the attorney for the defendant and the attorney for the Government would have an opportunity to notify the court and each other of those objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.537" offset="7728335">Any that remained contested at the time of the sentencing hearing would be subjected before the court to factfinding to the presentation of witnesses or documents, if necessary, by argument of counsel, and ultimately by determination by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.361" offset="7783715">The court would then determine what the applicable guideline range is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.332" offset="7799597">Based upon that guideline range, whether or not a sentence of probation or incarceration was appropriate, whether or not there were any circumstances indicated a departure above or below the guidelines was appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1932.828" offset="7885592">The next thing the court would do would then turn the sentence and make a decision, under our proposal, whether or not the defendant had any prior jail credit that should come off of that sentence and also decide whether it is concurrent or consecutive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.403" offset="7931881">That issue then, addressed by both parties, would be part of the case that could go up on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.505" offset="7948286">So there would be a final determination at that time as to any contested issues, entitlement to jail credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.992" offset="7974200">Once that matter was resolved once and for all, the person would go off and serve his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.544" offset="7992381">Under the Attorney General's proposal what would happen is the district court at the time of sentencing would determine all of these issues except for jail credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.217" offset="8019130">There may be 5 days of jail credit at stake, or may, as in this case, be 429 days of jail credit at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.870" offset="8045671">The district court under the Bureau of Prisons' approach, and the Government's approach would not make any determination officially as to what impact that jail credit would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.976" offset="8078167">It would decide only what the length of the sentence would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.059" offset="8086422">The person would then go off to the Bureau of Prisons if it's an incarceration sentence for a determination at some point in time later by the Bureau of Prisons as to the entitlement to jail credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.367" offset="8127695">And there are two or three things about the way that would happen that I think make it clear that Congress would not have wanted this to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.854" offset="8153609">It's going to occur at the first place, let's say, in some remote facility from the district of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.858" offset="8177641">In Mr. Wilson's case, he's incarcerated at Marianna Prison in Florida, which is a different district and different circuit from the district and circuit of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.780" offset="8213377">It would also occur at a time... at a place and in a point remote in time from the sentencing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.017" offset="8238350">He would have gone... when he arrived at Federal custody, he would have initially been held by the marshals for some period of time, awaiting transportation, would have then been in transit from anywhere from weeks to months before he arrived at the institution designated by the Bureau of Prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.759" offset="8289237">At some point in time after his arrival there, he would have a meeting with a staff member of the prison who would make an initial informal decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.531" offset="8320375">If he was unsatisfied with that, it would then go to... he would then submit a written complaint, which would then be responded to by the warden of the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.454" offset="8352035">If he were unsatisfied with that determination, he would then go to the regional director of the Bureau of Prisons, in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.755" offset="8373246">He would get a response to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.306" offset="8379411">If he were dissatisfied with that response, he would then go to the general counsel of the Bureau of Prisons, in writing, for a response.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.360" offset="8403653">If he were dissatisfied at that point... and by now we're probably months, if not a year from his arrival in Federal custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.949" offset="8434059">At that point, he would then initiate litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.167" offset="8442941">And I agree with Ms. Wax that the most likely form of that litigation would be an action under 2241, a habeas corpus action challenging the execution of his sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.256" offset="8991304">I think that I would agree on that point with Ms. Wax, that Congress may have been an little inelegant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.810" offset="9017426">In the legislative history for that rather than referring to commencement, they referred to imposition of sentence, where any time accrued prior to imposition of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.915" offset="9049922">Now I think Congress at that point was making no distinction between imposition of sentence and commencement of sentence because, in fact, as I said before, the vast majority of cases, those are the same date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.223" offset="9091091">For the few rare cases where those are not the same date, I think there are two reasons that our proposal is still the more workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.877" offset="9121707">One is in those cases where the difference, the gap in those dates works to the potential detriment of a defendant who might accrue some additional entitlement to jail credit after imposition of sentence, 2255 is still available, or 2241, whichever is the appropriate remedy, to restore that credit to the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="2423.742" offset="9849165">What is a little more likely is what happened here, and that's where a person is in State custody, either serving a sentence or pending disposition of another case is borrowed by the Federal Government under a writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.113" offset="9894722">There's some disposition, and then is returned to State custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.501" offset="9908201">In those cases there's potential either way, either for the potential loss of otherwise entitled credit, or for what the Government refers to as double credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.940" offset="9953968">I think that there are a number of things that keep those really from being a concern that Congress would have had felt to justify, keeping this in the Bureau of Prisons as opposed to placing in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.117" offset="10002660">One thing, in both situations, where the person is in State custody where there are parallel prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.585" offset="10020528">If he's arrested by the State first, prosecuted there, not yet to disposition, also prosecuted in Federal court... which we're seeing also in growing numbers in drug cases and sometimes in gun cases... what happens in those situations most of the time is that the State parallel prosecution is dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.280" offset="10091372">The person is turned over for Federal prosecution and usually for Federal custody after... usually before disposition of the Federal case, and so at that point, the State case either has, or is about to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.771" offset="10141318">So there's not going to be a question of credit attributed to another State sentence and the district court will be in a position, then to measure and evaluate any prior jail credit and award it or not award it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.729" offset="10181129">There also are going to be cases where the person already adjudicated and serving a State sentence is borrowed under a writ by the Federal Government for the purpose of the prosecution of the Federal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.667" offset="10220939">In those cases, under the statute he's not entitled to that credit because it's already been attributed to the State sentence that he's now serving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.238" offset="10247166">The much less frequent possibility is... is actually what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.225" offset="10271095">I mean, this is the only case that I can find in the cases since 3585 where this has actually occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.229" offset="10291157">And that is where the person is released by the State to the Federal Government... both charges still pending... is adjudicated first in Federal court, sentenced, then is sentenced by the State court after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.104" offset="10334624">So at the point when Federal sentence is imposed, State sentence has not been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.239" offset="10351238">There's no credit yet for the time in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.023" offset="10362314">But at some point in time after that there is adjudication in State court and credit is either awarded or denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.994" offset="10386242">So there's a potential under that scenario, under this scenario, for a double credit, which Congress did intend to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.767" offset="10417276">However, there are adequate protections for that not to happen unless the State wants it to happen, which the State has a right for it to happen, that congressional intent will not be subverted by the district court making this determination for all the reasons that we think the district court should be making the determination anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.408" offset="10475895">The State court at the time... in this case, at the time Mr. Wilson came into the State court for adjudication and for sentencing, the State court knew what the Federal sentence was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.966" offset="10514138">These were parallel and related prosecutions, joint investigations, mutual cooperation between the law enforcement authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.136" offset="10542768">The State court knew what the disposition of Mr. Wilson's sentence was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.571" offset="10556561">At that time what they knew was that the district court had denied credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.475" offset="10576100">They awarded credit, they sentenced him to a sentence that would run concurrent with the Federal sentence, and that under State law would be consumed by the Federal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.664" offset="10608910">So their intent as reflected in the sentence that was imposed on him in State court, was that he get double credit, not just for time in custody prior to trial, but for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.604" offset="10648616">In other words, by giving him a concurrent sentence--</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.020" offset="11990265">I think that all of the language talking about parole, about good-time credits, where Congress says that these result in a prisoner not knowing until the date that he or she is released what that release date is going to be is contrary to the purposes of sentencing as we see them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.837" offset="13449570">Just a couple of quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.037" offset="13454376">First of all, it's very important to realize that the sentence does not begin in the Federal system at sentencing and a delay between sentencing and the advent of sentence is very, very common.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.977" offset="13502128">Individuals are given time to put their affairs in order, or they're put out on appeal bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.346" offset="13515607">They're on a State detainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.731" offset="13529191">They were in State custody before they went over to the Federal side, as this respondent was.</text>

            <text syncTime="3359.593" offset="13592616">As a numerical matter, yes, most sentencing credit issues are routine issues involving presentencing credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.680" offset="13616962">But the number of instances in which there is postsentencing detention for which an individual could get credit, those instances are considerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.770" offset="13653325">Sometimes individuals are held on the State side, the charges are dropped, the individual's given probation, so his State presentence time doesn't count towards anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.625" offset="13688747">His State conviction is overturned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3410.607" offset="13796685">My second point, of course, is that respondent does concede that some double credit awards simply will not be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.761" offset="13825315">There will be windfalls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.111" offset="13830644">Individuals, who through an accident of timing, get a second award of credit by the State after sentencing will get to keep it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.265" offset="13855304">The individuals who get the award against a State sentence before their Federal sentencing will not get to have a second award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.519" offset="13880277">That's a completely arbitrary result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.585" offset="13888531">Congress could not have intended that result, which goes against all of the goals of the Sentencing Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.107" offset="13914654">And my third point is respondent makes a lot out of the possibility of putting all the information bearing on sentencing credit in the presentence report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.630" offset="13956763">If you read the sections of the Sentencing Reform Act that govern what goes into a presentencing report, Rule 32 section 3552, not a word is said about you need to find these facts and put in this information so that the court can make a credit determination.</text>
