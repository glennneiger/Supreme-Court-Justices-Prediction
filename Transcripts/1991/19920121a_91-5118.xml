            <text syncTime="38.157" offset="290705">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="40.829" offset="301363">The issue in this case is whether, in a capital case, a defendant's right to an impartial jury requires a trial court to inquire of potential jurors whether, if the defendant is convicted of murder, they would automatically impose a sentence of death at a subsequent sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.218" offset="366983">The issue in this case arose at Mr. Morgan's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.972" offset="382029">The defendant asked the trial court to ask the jurors, would you impose... if you convict Derrick Morgan of murder, would you impose a sentence of death no matter what the facts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.126" offset="422571">The trial court declined, giving an explanation that he had asked that question in substantially similar form at some earlier time, but he had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.324" offset="455381">At the State's request, the trial court did ask the potential jurors whether they could never impose the death penalty upon Mr. Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.009" offset="490176">Following those questions, approximately 17 jurors were excused because they could not sentence Mr. Morgan to death, or they said they could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.955" offset="525912">Mr. Morgan was convicted by the jury of murder, and he was subsequently sentenced to death by that jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.917" offset="553810">The Illinois supreme court affirmed both the conviction and the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.011" offset="570111">On this issue, it ruled that there was no requirement to reverse Witherspoon in the jury, in other words, to ask whether the jurors would always impose death.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.497" offset="604070">It also held that because Mr. Morgan could not demonstrate that any of the jurors were prejudiced against him, that he was not entitled to any relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.193" offset="638865">This Court granted certiorari to review that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.735" offset="653076">Now, the Sixth Amendment and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee a defendant an impartial sentencing hearing in a death penalty proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.512" offset="688184">Automatic death penalty jurors, people who would automatically impose death, cannot serve because they cannot be impartial.</text>
