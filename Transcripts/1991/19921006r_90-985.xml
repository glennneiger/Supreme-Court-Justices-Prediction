            <label>Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow</label>
            <text syncTime="12.909" offset="197828">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.741" offset="209113">Through the misapplication of section 2 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia now monitors State trespass action.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.379" offset="251640">It has been our position from the outset of this litigation that this case should not be in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.202" offset="270971">The Fourth Circuit holding rests on two faulty legal premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.286" offset="287271">First, an opposition to abortion constitutes invidious discrimination against women, and secondly, the district court further compounded its error by misapplying this Court's jurisprudence with regard to the constitutional right to interstate travel by finding that petitioners' conduct would have an effect on interstate travel and thereby purposely violating the right to interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.903" offset="377759">The Fourth Circuit's position goes a long way in making 1985(3) the general Federal tort law that this Court has long counseled against.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.930" offset="417883">There is redress available, and that is in the Virginia Commonwealth courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.092" offset="438572">In fact, the circuit court in Norfolk, Virginia has issued injunctions which prohibits blockades and prohibit trespass activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.939" offset="469919">The law does offer redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.079" offset="478488">This is not a case where redress is unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.232" offset="487056">It is.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.161" offset="490817">State court injunctions whose provisions mirror those of the Federal court here in significant areas have been upheld in numerous State courts on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.239" offset="531150">This is a case of statutory construction and statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.754" offset="549123">The question presented is, does section 2 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 cover the petitioners' activities?</text>
            <text syncTime="108.409" offset="579843">Our position is that it does not, and the Fourth Circuit is wrong and should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.992" offset="598128">In order for there to be a violation of section 2 of the act, there must be established, as this Court held in Griffin, a class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators' actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.651" offset="648806">Here, the class has been defined as women seeking abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.943" offset="661972">Simply put, women seeking abortion is not a valid class.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.305" offset="679421">A class should be defined by who people are, not something they would like to do or an activity they would like to engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.220" offset="707007">Respondents' class theory converts any group seeking to engage in any activity or conduct into a class, again creating a general Federal tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.135" offset="742742">Both the district court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals entered over a dozen specific findings of facts dealing with the motivation or purpose of the petitioners' activities; yet despite these specific factual findings, the lower court came to the illogical conclusion of law that opposition to abortion constitutes invidious class-based discrimination against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.492" offset="832081">That proposition has already been rejected by this Court in finding that classifications based on pregnancies do not constitute, per se, violations of equal protection and do not constitute invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.820" offset="881400">That was in Geduldig.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.701" offset="884953">This is especially so here, since the record establishes clearly what motivates the petitioners' conduct, and that is their opposition to the activity of abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.219" offset="927062">This is not a case where the petitioners are using their opposition of abortion as a pretext to some type of gender discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.073" offset="958409">The petitioners did not engage in their conduct, or nor would have they engaged in their conduct because of its effect on women.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.059" offset="986412">It is because of their opposition to abortion that these petitioners are motivated.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.251" offset="1007206">Petitioners simply do not engage in the type of activity and do not conduct their activities with the invidious discriminatory animus required by section 2 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.430" offset="1059869">As I said, there's redress available.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.743" offset="1069168">This is not a case where redress has been unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.934" offset="1077946">Petitioners have been the subject of State court injunctions in other parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.858" offset="1101560">There's also an issue I think that's equally important here, and that is the scope of the protections under section 1985(3), which is section 2 of the act... of the Ku Klux Klan Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.896" offset="1141789">There was a limiting amendment drafted by Representative Willard.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.810" offset="1153387">The purpose of it was to mark a boundary with regard to the overall scope of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.084" offset="1174494">Concerned over possible creations of a general Federal tort law, the drafters of the limiting amendment required that there not just be a deprivation of a right, but there be a deprivation of equality, of equal privileges and immunities, or equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.957" offset="1233949">Thus, for a denial to be actionable pursuant to the act, to be a conspiratorial objective, the conspirators must seek to permit to some what they deny to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.854" offset="1273550">Here, there's been no denial of equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.234" offset="1283059">The scope of the petitioners' protest affects all involved in the abortion process.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.929" offset="1301867">As this Court recognized in Novotny, section 2 of the Ku Klux Klan Act itself is a remedial provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.363" offset="1327572">It provides a remedy in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.844" offset="1337498">The rights, privileges, and immunities that it protects are to be found elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.208" offset="1359023">Here, the respondents have asserted that petitioners violated their constitutional right to interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.763" offset="1385250">They base this assertion on the theory that by simply being engaged in interstate travel and having that right affected by petitioners' conduct, that the petitioners thereby purposely violated the respondents' constitutional right to interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.303" offset="1447421">That theory of the respondents would turn any potential automobile accident involving an out-of-State driver into an interstate travel claim, because it would have an effect on interstate travel, and I would point out that the Fourth Circuit in its findings of fact held that petitioners' activities, if they were to have been engaged in, would have had an effect on interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.208" offset="1538954">They did not ever find under a finding of fact that there was a purposeful violation of interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.902" offset="1561733">Our position is that the Fourth Circuit and the district court greatly expanded this Court's jurisprudence with regard to interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.595" offset="1592558">First, this is not a case where the petitioners discriminated against in-State residence versus out-of-State residence concerning access to the abortion clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.981" offset="1630070">Respondents conceded this during the previous argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.944" offset="1637906">Secondly, this Court's cases in the plain language of the statute itself require that for there to be an interstate travel violation there has to be a purposeful deprivation of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.912" offset="1677821">The purpose, as found by the district court and affirmed by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals here was that the petitioners engaged in their activities in order to express their opposition to abortion, not... no findings of fact that there was purposeful deprivations of the right to interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.885" offset="1753681">In fact, as I said, the trial court itself only held that petitioners, if they were to have engaged in their activities, would have had only an effect on interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.759" offset="1785237">There is no finding that here there was a purposeful action taken in deprivation of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.205" offset="1815017">It is important to note again that in drafting the legislation the 42nd Congress made the determination in the concept of the limiting amendment that they were going to look at the issue through the lens of motivation and not impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.574" offset="1868411">As I said, the language of itself, the statute itself requires that there must be a purposeful violation of the interstate travel right.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.230" offset="1907072">The question in one sense would be, did the petitioners conduct their activities for the purpose of depriving respondents of their right to travel?</text>
            <text syncTime="448.867" offset="1941658">The record below supports that they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.178" offset="1950853">The trial court's detailed findings of fact establishes what the animus and motivation of Jayne Bray and the other petitioners... yes, Justice Stevens.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.833" offset="1985439">You said that there was no district court finding with regard to intent to interfere with travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.908" offset="2005815">I have before me the finding that petitioners engaged in this conspiracy for the purpose, either directly or indirectly, of depriving women seeking abortions and related medical and counseling services of the right to travel.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.440" offset="2063911">The finding of fact here states... and it's on page 22(a) of the joint... the petition's appendix... states, rescue demonstrations... paragraph 28 specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.880" offset="2117723">Rescue demonstrations, by blocking access to clinics, therefore have the effect of obstructing and interfering with interstate travel of these women.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.146" offset="2154713">The test, however, is that there must be purposeful activity, that their aim must have been not a mere consequence of it, which is what the... where the illogical conclusion of law took place here.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.378" offset="2279683">1985(3), section 2 of the Ku Klux Klan Act, requires that there be a purposeful deprivation of the right, not an impact, and that's what the motivation... the view of what the motivation has to be on.</text>

            <text syncTime="598.309" offset="2539444">If a group of conspirators assault someone carrying a picket sign because they don't believe there should be a First Amendment right to picket, they certainly are guilty of a tort and they interfere with that individual's exercise of constitutionally protected rights, but in no sense do they deprive him of equal protection or equal privileges and immunities simply because they assault him and not everyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.496" offset="2632127">But if the conspirators come upon a picketer and assault him because he's black and they don't believe that blacks should have equal First Amendment rights, then they satisfy the class-based invidiously discriminatory animus requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.794" offset="2685312">That is not what is going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.065" offset="2694403">Petitioners do not interfere with respondents' rights because respondents are women.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.320" offset="2715405">Petitioners do what they do because they're opposed to an activity, the activity of abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.904" offset="2737766">They target their conspirators not because of who they are, but because of what they are doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.276" offset="2759291">Respondents now seem to recognize this.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.269" offset="2771203">In their brief on reargument they say that this is, quote, unlike the usual section 1985(3) case, end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.143" offset="2802759">But it is not a section 1985(3) case at all, and the reason is that section 1985(3) is not concerned simply with the deprivation of Federal rights, however fundamental, however important.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.731" offset="2857093">It is concerned with the discriminatory deprivation of Federal rights, and petitioners are perfectly nondiscriminatory, nondiscriminating, in their opposition to abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.969" offset="2898053">Respondents' answer to this argument is that only women can exercise the right to an abortion, and therefore petitioners' antiabortion activities have a discriminatory impact on women.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.088" offset="2950507">People intend the natural consequences of their acts, and therefore respondents argue, you can infer from the discriminatory impact that petitioners have a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.604" offset="2992617">A few examples will show that the logic of that doesn't hold up.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.758" offset="3009230">Consider, for example, an Indian tribe with exclusive fishing rights in a particular river.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.361" offset="3031591">A group of ecologists get together who are opposed to fishing in the river, because they think it disturbs the ecology.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.806" offset="3057400">They interfere with the Indians' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.378" offset="3063670">The impact of their conspiracy is on a particular Indian group, but it would be quite illogical to infer from that they have any animus against Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.726" offset="3105048">They're opposed to fishing in the river, not Indians, even though only Indians can fish in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.099" offset="3126572">Petitioners are opposed to abortion, not women, even though only women can exercise the right to an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.874" offset="3153635">Another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.547" offset="3160323">Suppose a group of men and women get together who are opposed to the draft and they interfere with registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.574" offset="3184460">The direct impact of their conspiracy will be felt only by men, since only men are eligible for the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.588" offset="3208492">But, again, it would be quite wrong to infer from that impact that the conspirators have any animus against men.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.933" offset="3233883">They're opposed to the draft, not men, even though only men are eligible for the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.847" offset="3253528">This Court has, in fact, already rejected respondents' logic in the Geduldig case.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.330" offset="3275470">There Justice Stewart, writing for the Court 3 years after he wrote for the Court in Griffin, explained that classifications based on pregnancy are not the same as gender discrimination, even though only women can become pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.091" offset="3330537">Accepting respondents' argument that activities in opposition to abortion are the same as gender discrimination, because only women can have abortions, would require overruling the rationale of Geduldig.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.040" offset="3382363">The decision below should be reversed for an independent reason, the reason that petitioners did not act with the purpose of interfering with respondents' right to interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.587" offset="3432519">This is respondents' logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.987" offset="3442132">One, petitioners' purpose is to block access to abortion clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.242" offset="3463134">Two, some of those seeking access to the abortion clinics come from out of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.997" offset="3486122">Three, petitioners know this.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.247" offset="3495108">And four, therefore petitioners' purpose is to interfere with people from out of State getting access to the abortion clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.234" offset="3531052">That confuses purpose, which is what the statute requires in plain terms, with incidental effect, which is insufficient under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.520" offset="3568251">For example, under respondents' logic, consider a typical picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.453" offset="3587999">The union's purpose is to keep the customers out of a particular establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.796" offset="3605345">Some of the customers are black.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.568" offset="3616421">The union knows this.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.178" offset="3622899">Under respondents' logic, you would say that the union's purpose is to keep out black customers, but that's an inaccurate statement of their purpose, just as it is an inaccurate statement of petitioners' purpose to say that they keep people from... they want to keep people from out of State from gaining access to the abortion clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.012" offset="3698236">Last year respondents' counsel said it would be silly... his word, silly... to argue that the petitioners care whether the people come from out of State or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.247" offset="3739196">But if the people don't... if the petitioners don't care whether the people are from out of State or not, you cannot say that their purpose is to keep out of Staters from obtaining access to the abortion clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.054" offset="3786426">This Court's decisions on the right to travel recognize this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.778" offset="3805234">The Court has found that right implicated only when there has been discrimination between residents, on the one hand and nonresidents or newcomers on the other, as in Shapiro against Thompson, or Dunn v. Blumstein.</text>

            <text syncTime="956.154" offset="3970746">So it may be that they would have made a discrimination claim in that case... in that case, making it to be like the Guest case, where the specific allegation was that there was a right to interfere with interstate travel as such.</text>

Casey that that right is necessary in order for that class to be equal citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.644" offset="5108744">In this case, the two elements of the conspiracy... of section 1985(3) are not at issue, the conspiracy and the act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.874" offset="5161616">Although there's no dispute about those elements, I would like to note that the mob characteristics of this case are particularly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.278" offset="5191291">Congress enacted section 1985(3), called the Ku Klux Klan Act, because it understood that mobs could deprive individuals of rights in a way that single... single individuals cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.667" offset="5244790">The petitioners here, who operate systematically in large groups nationwide, are a much closer analog to the Ku Klux Klan than the two conspirators that this Court recognized could violate section 1985(3) in Griffin, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.645" offset="5304767">Because there's no dispute about the conspiracy in the act, I will focus on the other two elements, that the conspiracy be motivated by class-based animus, and here, that the independent right, the right to travel, be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.255" offset="5363177">To begin with class-based animus, we must first show that women are a protected class, and indeed, neither the petitioners nor the Solicitor General dispute that women are a class under 1985(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.474" offset="5408003">The broad text and legislative history of section 1985(3) dictate that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.648" offset="5432767">Instead, petitioners and the Government argue that here only a subset of women are affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.501" offset="5460143">That subset distinction is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.713" offset="5472995">Discrimination usually occurs against the subset of a class that is exercising its rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.539" offset="5500267">For example, those who blocked African-American citizens from entering integrated schools targeted only some citizens but demonstrated invidious racial animus against an entire class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.637" offset="5556692">The requirement of class-based animus was created by this Court in Griffin v. Breckenridge in order to prevent section 1985(3) from becoming a Federal tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.974" offset="5602040">Animus should not be confused with personal malice or hostility, especially because much of discrimination against women throughout history has been benign.</text>

            <text syncTime="1742.012" offset="7114217">The facts here track the unanimous decision of Griffin in three important ways, and in one way this case is much stronger than Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.667" offset="7152878">First, in both cases the defendants physically obstructed travel, although not at a State border.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.733" offset="7181090">Here, in Griffin, there was a single episode of obstruction of travel on a public highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.898" offset="7205750">Here, there was a pattern of blockades at a clinic in Falls Church, Virginia, less than 10 miles from the D.C. and Maryland borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.244" offset="7243157">The court below found that petitioners engaged in the conspiracy, as Justice Stevens noted before, for the purpose, either directly or indirectly, of depriving women of the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.440" offset="7287879">Second, in Griffin the Court remanded to determine if there had been actual or intended interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.036" offset="7322256">And here there was a factual finding by the Court that a substantial number of respondents, in fact, engaged in interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.251" offset="7355170">As the Griffin case came to this Court, there was very little evidence of interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.374" offset="7379621">In fact, the Solicitor General's brief in that case, which was filed on behalf of those people who had been deprived of their rights, noted in footnote 6 that they believed there had been no allegations of interference with interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.814" offset="7433433">That is why this Court, in Griffin, allowed the plaintiffs on remand to elect... to prove some connection with interstate travel in a variety of ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.569" offset="7528414">And they said in that case that equal protection of the laws should be interpreted broadly to... even if interstate travel wasn't violated, that because the plaintiffs there had been beaten up, their equal protection of the laws had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.489" offset="7596123">Third, in both Griffin and this case, the defendants blocked the travel, not because they cared about the travel per se, as we had said last time, but because they wanted to stop the activities the plaintiffs were traveling for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.081" offset="7666445">In Griffin it was civil rights activities, and here it was to exercise the right to privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.957" offset="7694030">So this case tracks Griffin in the three ways of physical obstruction, actual interstate travel, and the fact that in both cases the people were traveling in order to exercise other constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.957" offset="7754008">Significantly, however, this case is stronger than Griffin because in Griffin there were only two conspirators, and here there was a mob.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.523" offset="7792251">And as I've mentioned before, Congress was particularly concerned, in enacting section 1985(3), about the fact that mobs could deprive individuals of equal protection of the law in a way that a sole person cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.125" offset="7850661">Nonetheless, the Solicitor General insists that respondents are opening a Pandora's box because, he argues, there's no showing that petitioners purposefully interfered with respondents' right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.102" offset="7902592">Well here, of course, petitioners did physically block respondents' right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.476" offset="7928088">There can be no more blatant obstruction of the right of travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.100" offset="7942507">In this Court's... in most of this Court's other travel cases, such as Shapiro v. Thompson, there is no direct interference with the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.856" offset="7985557">Only in Griffin and in this case was there physical obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.009" offset="8002171">The petitioners... the Solicitor General's argument can be accepted only if this Court takes an unnaturally narrow view of the right to travel under section 1985(3) so that it is only violated when the defendants block only interstate travelers, and when they block them with the sole purpose to prevent crossing straight... State lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.655" offset="8096734">That was not the case in the unanimous decision of Griffin v. Breckenridge, and yet this Court held the right to travel could be violated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.800" offset="11357338">Briefly, first, reliance on Kush v. Rutledge with regard to the hindrance claim is misplaced because the legislation requires, under the prevent and hinder clause, the same word equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.896" offset="11409792">The amendment process required equal to be added.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.269" offset="11419196">The word equal, in the statute, was where the animus language derived from, and that clearly has to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.962" offset="11446050">I understand they're now trying to pull away from their previous admission on that point, but Kush v. Rutledge certainly doesn't point to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.717" offset="11473008">In fact, Justice Stevens, in finding the claim could proceed under 1985(2) there noted that, specifically, the same language in 85(2) was not present in 85(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.785" offset="11513341">Secondly, the defendants or the petitioners' hearts were read, if you will, by the district court here, what their purpose was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.488" offset="11544061">The court stated... the district court found it is undisputable that all defendants share a deep commitment to the goals of stopping the practice of abortion and reversing its legalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.076" offset="11582514">There is no animus against the class of women; it is an opposition to a specific activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.480" offset="11608114">Secondly, to view animus in the way respondents have would be... using an example, if, in fact, there was a disagreement or an opposition to affirmative action by a particular group, and that would... if their view were to carry the day, would have an effect on affirmative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.654" offset="11692750">But to translate that effect into an invidious discriminatory animus, that that now means that the group that was gaining the benefit of the affirmative action project is now the target of their animus, would be incorrect unless it was some type of pretext for the objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.374" offset="11759624">For instance, in the school example that was given if, in fact, desegregation... the integration of the school took place... in the situation that was referred to in Little Rock there, it was clear that the objection... the opposition was not to children going to school, it was the opposition of children going to school with black children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.897" offset="11833707">The modus... the motive, the animus in that case clearly was the opposition to blacks going to the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.754" offset="11865159">I'd also state that our position is that Satty certainly does not support the position on discriminatory... invidious discrimination, because Satty was a title 7 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.451" offset="11911970">This Court has required invidious discriminatory animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.332" offset="11923464">Clearly here the animus, as I said, is to the opposition of abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.875" offset="11941645">The fact that it has an effect on women seriously mischaracterizes the nature of the dispute, and also, I think, mischaracterizes the nature of the issue presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.422" offset="11979888">This Court, in Casey, did not state that the right to abortion was essential to equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.936" offset="12005906">I think that's important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.609" offset="12012594">The fact that the... this Court's jurisprudence with regard to reproductive freedom has had an effect on women's ability to participate equally in the Nation, in the social life of the country, does not become the legal equivalent of there now being an invidious discriminatory animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.059" offset="12078422">And I think Casey, to the contrary, clearly does not support the proposition that opposition to abortion constitutes invidious discrimination against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.924" offset="12113844">First, throughout its abortion jurisprudence this Court has not found the right to exist under the equal protection clause, which would be the normal place to find restrictions being reviewed as invidiously discriminatory under the equal protection analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.436" offset="12175911">That's not what this Court has chose to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.316" offset="12183434">Secondly, I think significantly, that the Court's opinion in Casey points to the issue that opposition to an activity does not constitute invidious discrimination against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.554" offset="12228365">Specifically in the joint opinion it is stated:</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.547" offset="12240381">Men and women of good conscience can disagree, and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy even in its earliest stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.525" offset="12280297">Some of us, referring to members of the Court, as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.240" offset="12307150">If men and women of good conscience can sincerely disagree over this issue, then how can opposition to abortion constitute per se invidious discrimination against women?</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.557" offset="12352394">It cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.509" offset="12356156">The Court also recognized in Casey, specifically, that abortion is a unique act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.352" offset="12379562">And it said it is fraught with consequences for others, and included in those others was the life or potential life of the unborn child, the woman who undergoes the procedures, her family, and her spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.218" offset="12423030">The Court further went on in Casey to recognize that there is, and I'm going to quote again:</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.333" offset="12443510">As with abortion, reasonable people have differences of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.406" offset="12455735">One view is based on such reverence... excuse me... for the wonder of creation that any pregnancy ought to be welcome and carried to full term, no matter how difficult it will be to provide for the child and ensure its well-being.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.782" offset="12505263">Another is that the inability to provide for the nurture and care of the infant is cruelty to the child and anguish to the parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.017" offset="12530236">These are intimate views with intimate, infinite variations, and they are deep personal in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.890" offset="12553746">That... those statements from the joint opinion in Casey clearly, unequivocally, do not support the proposition that opposition to abortion is the legal equivalent, per se, invidious discrimination against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.980" offset="12614037">And I think, clearly, it cuts the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.982" offset="12626053">What this Court recognized in Casey is that the issue of abortion is one of profound national debate.</text>
