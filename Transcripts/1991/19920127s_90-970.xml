            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90927">The opinion of the Court in No. 90-970, Lechmere versus National Labor Relations Board will be announced by Justice Thomas.</text>

            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="13.377" offset="144426">This is a case here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.750" offset="173892">Petitioner, Lechmere, owns and operate a retails store located in a shopping plaza in Newington, Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.953" offset="206702">Lechmere is also a part owner of the parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.038" offset="227077">As part of a campaign to organize Lechmere's employees, non-employee organizers entered the parking lot and placed handbills on the windshields of cars parked in the employee section of the lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.534" offset="289040">Lechmere's manager asked them to leave explaining that the store had a strict policy against handbill distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.713" offset="325716">They left but came back on several subsequent occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.365" offset="344315">Each time, Lechmere personnel asked them to leave and remove the handbills.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.523" offset="368974">The Union organizers then relocated to a strip of public property adjoining the parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.579" offset="401157">From there, they passed out handbills and picketed Lechmere.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.590" offset="421219">The Union also contacted a substantial percentage of Lechmere's employees directly by tracing their license plate numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.375" offset="460403">The Union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that Lechmere had violated the National Labor Relations Act by barring the organizers from its property.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.246" offset="519858">The Board ruled in the Union's favor and issued a cease and desist order requiring Lechmere to allow the organizers onto its parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.143" offset="563430">The Court of Appeals agreed to enforce the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.578" offset="581193">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.957" offset="606689">This case is controlled by the 1956 decision of this Court, NLRB versus Babcock &amp; Wilcox.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.909" offset="642529">In that case, we made it clear that the NLRA does not protect the trespasses of non-employee union organizers except in the rare case where the employees are inaccessible and there is no reasonable means short of trespass for the Union to communicate with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.048" offset="727061">We have explained that a union seeking to show that employees are inaccessible bears a heavy burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.892" offset="758408">Here, the Union failed to carry that burden by failing to establish the existence of any obstacles rendering Lechmere's employees inaccessible.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.581" offset="801249">The Board's order, therefore, cannot be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.706" offset="817654">Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Blackmun has joined; Justice Stevens has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
