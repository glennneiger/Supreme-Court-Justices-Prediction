            <text syncTime="141.773" offset="709033">It was delivered by the Central Bank as one of two alternative instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.880" offset="733484">They had a Bonod and a promissory note in 1982 when the Central Bank's obligation had matured under a program that it had implemented in 1981 to provide foreign exchange at a fixed exchange rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.982" offset="805895">This was part of the Central Bank's primary functions because when we talk about the Argentine Central Bank we are talking about a classic central bank in the sense that it's explicitly prohibited from participating in commercial enterprises, and one of its primary responsibilities is the issuance, regulating the foreign exchange markets, determining how foreign exchange should be allocated, establishing foreign exchange rates and policies, and providing counsel in those areas to the Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.336" offset="947270">In 1981 the government, the Central Bank created a program where for new and renewed loans it fixed through a... use of a specified formula the exchange rate that would be used when these various debts matured.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.728" offset="1020831">It did this to provide a cut off of credit to, foreign credit to Argentina because of the rapid and unpredictable devaluation of the Argentine currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.839" offset="1077255">When the Central Bank's obligation under this 1981 program matured and it was obligated to provide dollars to, as the foreign exchange in connection with its functioning as the government's responsible agent for foreign exchange, it didn't have the necessary reserves and thus what the Central Bank did is it issued two types of instruments, the promissory note and the issue, the instrument at issue in this case, the Bonod.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.478" offset="1199822">In considering the first issue, therefore, whether the Central Bank's issuance of the Bonod was commercial or sovereign, we have an instrument with the following characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.948" offset="1245693">One, it was issued by the Central Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.767" offset="1256978">It did not finance the acquisition of any goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.921" offset="1269621">It in of itself raised no money.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.833" offset="1285294">It financed, as I said before, the Central Bank's own obligation under the 1981 foreign exchange rate program.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.928" offset="1321657">And unlike the promissory note which I referred to as the other instrument that was issued roughly contemporaneously with the Bonod, it contained no language purporting to submit to jurisdiction anyplace.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.633" offset="1572432">Not, not anything, but I do think that a kind of program that goes to where the courts have, in looking at foreign exchange have recognized that the regulation of foreign exchange markets are one of the core official responsibilities that... and if you look at this transaction, what it was doing is it was obligated to, as one of its responsibilities, to provide foreign exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.780" offset="1680997">It came the time to provide the foreign exchange, it lacked the necessary reserves, and what it did is it just substituted the Bonod for the foreign exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.297" offset="1719136">We would say if the government had issued the foreign exchange that would be doing what the government does, issuing the foreign exchange, provide the foreign exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.566" offset="1764171">It couldn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.686" offset="1768664">It issued the Bonod.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.369" offset="1775351">We think that the nature of that activity is still the same.</text>

            <label>Justice Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="411.461" offset="1787786">But it had issued the Bonod because in effect it was trying to find a means, or it had originally been trying to find a means of standing behind, as it were, the private trading entities of the country, and therefore it was, it had a rather more specific purpose in a more specific temporal period of the market than merely creating a foreign exchange structure in the general sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.728" offset="1888827">Well, no, I think it was, Justice Souter, creating a foreign exchange structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.112" offset="1906382">It wasn't, as a private party might do, picking and choosing transactions, evaluating transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.367" offset="1931355">It was in a sense in 1981 created an entitlement, if loans met certain criteria you would get this future, this exchange rate at a promised rate in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.235" offset="1974823">So I think it's that kind of program which is really more what a sovereign would do than what a private party would do.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.441" offset="2003662">Mr. Davis, it seems to me that all you're saying is that its purpose was a governmental purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.806" offset="2029157">You're describing the reason it was doing it and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.319" offset="2043159">But the statute explicitly says that the character of the activity under the act, whether it is commercial or not, will not be determined by reference to its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.524" offset="2080044">It seems to me you have a commercial instrument here and we don't care what purpose it was issued for.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard J. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="488.858" offset="2097389">Well, we think that the reason we think we are looking at the nature is because what we're saying is that when the statute, as you point out, says you should look at the nature of the activity, it's not saying that you should look at the nature of some abstract activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.050" offset="2166143">It's saying you should look at the nature of the specific activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.282" offset="2178996">For us that doesn't mean that the beginning and the end of the inquiry where you say it's debt and therefore all debt is by nature commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.270" offset="2219015">This debt was issued in terms of without receiving any money in return.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.744" offset="2244929">It was issued, you know, not for raising money.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.896" offset="2257467">It was issued without financing goods, and it was issued for purpose of financing the own obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.151" offset="2330506">If I come in for whatever motive, for the government and I want my businesses to flourish, I come in and act as a guarantor in a commercial transaction, that is not a commercial act?</text>

            <text syncTime="560.861" offset="2385363">Under this program it was not guaranteeing, because the normal credit responsibility remained upon the private sector borrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.027" offset="2422039">What I mean by that is the private sector borrower was still required to provide the pesos.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.118" offset="2610434">I think there are two other things that are relevant in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.560" offset="2624122">One is that there's a lot of reference in the various briefs and some of the cases is that the criteria is whether a private party could do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.078" offset="2666231">And when you read some of the cases in the other briefs, if it could do something it is automatically considered commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.793" offset="2693085">If you actually go back to the legislative history that is cited, however, is what it says is if a private party might do something, then it could be considered commercial, not would automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.302" offset="2739165">I think the language in the legislative history in the House report would say in that circumstances it could be, not automatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.029" offset="2769990">The other reference that is often used in terms of the legislative history is borrowing money would be an example of a commercial activity, and what we would say is that the commercial activity, excuse me, that here that's why we look not to some broad based rule, because we understand that in the overwhelming percentage of the cases the issuance of debt is going to be a commercial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.955" offset="2857761">We also understand that in a gray area you're going to have a circumstance where parties can and do secure waivers of sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.824" offset="2909170">What we're saying, however, is where you have an instrument in which the Central Bank through the issuance of the Bonods raised no money, financed no goods, no acquisition of goods, and at the same time was financing its own obligation to provide foreign exchange, that the nature of that is a sovereign act and not a commercial act.</text>

            <text syncTime="800.920" offset="3345624">And they just don't look at the last act, they look to see what the real nature is.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.003" offset="3361925">And we think that that's also the position the Government took not in this case, the U.S. Government took not in this case but took in the Izvestia case in the Ninth Circuit in which it argued that you had to look beyond the fact that Izvestia was a newspaper and look to that its nature as the official organ.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.995" offset="3433918">But the second leg is also important in this dispute because in enacting the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act it is also clear that the Congress didn't want to convert our courts into international courts of claims and allow disputes to be heard here by people with no... where the plaintiffs had no meaningful connection with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.604" offset="3536318">It did this by creating the direct effect nexus requirement which required some direct effect in the United States from the sovereign's commercial act even if it is determined to be commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.114" offset="3590339">Now, the Government, the U.S. Government and the respondents urge a test essentially which says that anytime place of payment is in the United States and it's a dollar transaction, that is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.896" offset="3661497">They essentially urge a test which would say that if an Algerian state enterprise purchased machinery from a private Tunisian company next door, that, and they happened to have dollar payment, therefore it provided for a promissory note to be paid in the United States, that U.S. courts should hear that dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.988" offset="3749895">We believe that you need go no further than the language of the statute which requires that the direct effect be in the United States in order to determine that this proposition is erroneous and that the proper approach would require that the place of payment be in the United States and that the plaintiff be a U.S. person.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.015" offset="3837980">Because where there's a great weight attributed by the amicus and the respondents to this sole connection which is the place of payment, and while they have built it, tried to build it up in their briefs by talking in terms of that you actually paid there, I think that is the attributes of a place of payment is that you do pay there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1056.259" offset="4366907">In other words this isn't merely a kind of incidental side issue in these transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.165" offset="4498565">In one you talked about the means of enforcing a right, and I think those are two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.109" offset="4522388">That they're... yes, place of payment is one provision and that is considered important, and I think that that is done for the convenience of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.525" offset="4552063">I think when parties focus on the means of enforcement they focus on provisions that are very common in international instruments, that is actual submissions to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.861" offset="4589366">And indeed in this case you had two different instruments that were issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.925" offset="4609637">One is the promissory note which is not the instrument which is, which these parties held.</text>

            <text syncTime="1127.074" offset="4650179">You have on the other hand the Bonod which contained no such provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.758" offset="4672958">So I think that when the parties in international lending transactions do want to focus on how to enforce their rights and enforce their remedies, they focus on choice of law provisions, which is not present in this instrument, they focus on submissions to jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard W. Cutler</label>
            <text syncTime="1506.975" offset="6169774">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.051" offset="6202166">Our argument is the plain meaning of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.486" offset="6223900">The statute says that a commercial activity is to be judged by its nature, not its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.188" offset="6250649">In this case the petitioners issued negotiable certificates of debt, and there is nothing uniquely sovereign about going into debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.306" offset="6291191">Private corporations do it all the time, private parties do it all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.339" offset="6307283">In this case the petitioners decided, for whatever reason, to take the step into the commercial marketplace and they gave up some of their sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.517" offset="6352005">The petitioners' argument on that does raise some rather troubling points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.641" offset="6376455">The first is, of course, that it violates the plain language of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.724" offset="6388785">The second is that petitioners talk about the context of the Bonods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.220" offset="6410832">That is their word, that is not mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.391" offset="6415430">The context is really just a code word for purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.323" offset="6435178">And one of the difficulties is that it wholly obliterates the idea of restrictive sovereign immunity because every sovereign is going to find some public purpose ultimately to justify whatever acts it takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.576" offset="6504246">There is another possibility that is even more disturbing, and that is once purpose becomes an issue the petitioners' position is essentially mandating that U.S. courts become evaluators of the authenticity and the efficacy of foreign sovereigns' internal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.672" offset="6588569">The act says don't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.851" offset="6597347">Just look at the nature of the activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.314" offset="6611139">The nature of the, this activity was just like anybody else issuing a promissory note, if you will, or any kind of certificate of debt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.518" offset="6739975">The distinction I was trying to make was that the certificate of debt that Argentina and its Central Bank were issuing here was just like an ordinary commercial certificate of debt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.482" offset="6819805">--Oh, yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.153" offset="6822522">Our argument has never been that because it is a contract it is commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.149" offset="6846555">Our argument has been that it's a contract for the repayment of borrowed money which can be held by any private individual, and since it's negotiable the only restriction Argentina put on it, that it would be that it wasn't held by an Argentine citizen or by someone living in Argentina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.160" offset="6922519">The question of direct effect, Your Honor, is simply a matter of the same analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.287" offset="6967031">What did the petitioners do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.600" offset="6976331">Well, here they promised to pay in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.013" offset="6990019">And if I may assist the Chief Justice in the interest payments that the petitioners did make before they defaulted on the bonds, they did wire funds to a New York bank who then deposited them in the accounts of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.189" offset="7070685">In at least one payment each of the respondents was paid in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.161" offset="7090538">In this case payment, of course, was not just a part of performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.544" offset="7116138">It was all of performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.536" offset="7124080">It was 100 percent of the executory performance of the instruments, as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.560" offset="7144142">And the suggestion that somehow our people have to get a waiver before there is a connection with the United States again is simply an idea that goes beyond restrictive foreign sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.572" offset="7216240">The idea of sovereign immunity is that a sovereign may be brought to U.S. court against its will because of the nature of the instrument it issues, because of its conduct, and of course because of the direct effect in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.252" offset="7278934">The direct effect, we have said right from the beginning, Your Honor, right from the district court on up to here, was that there was a expectation of payment in the United States, in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.511" offset="7327939">The petitioners promised that they'd do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.393" offset="7339538">They didn't do it, and the effect was felt right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.557" offset="7356151">The example I believe that we gave in our brief was that of a shipment of grain that had to be delivered to New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.573" offset="7392200">In this case the cargo was dollars, and the respondent... and the petitioners just didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.176" offset="7418636">That effect in New York, I would make very clear to the Court, was not a fortuitous effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.140" offset="7442460">The petitioners were the ones who named New York as a potential place of payment at the option of the particular bond holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.747" offset="7480912">The petitioners keep reminding the Court in the brief that the Bonods were not negotiated, that is the terms of the Bonods were not negotiated, so that the designation of New York as a place of payment was petitioners' unilateral choice to make those Bonods look as if they were worth something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.021" offset="7565967">The effect was certainly foreseeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.973" offset="7577774">In this case the effect was exactly the petitioners' act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.509" offset="7599926">The petitioners didn't want to pay the respondents in New York and they didn't, and that's exactly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.414" offset="7631587">The respondents didn't get their money in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.336" offset="7639214">The effect and the act are virtually identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.230" offset="7654783">And if there be any reason to have to repeat it once more, the idea of the act to the effect, that line is as straight as an arrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.117" offset="7702431">And as far as we can see, Your Honor, that's subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.898" offset="7717477">I would--</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.554" offset="7800129">It doesn't seem to me that... there's a whole line of conflict of law cases that involve jurisdiction based upon the effect in another state, and it usually means something more than what you're describing, it seems to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="1929.474" offset="7859792">I must respectfully disagree, because in this case again it's not as if Argentina just picked New York out of the blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.941" offset="7893647">There was a real purpose to New York, and there was a real purpose to making the Bonods an acceptable method of going on with debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.489" offset="7935861">The purpose of naming New York, as Justice O'Connor mentioned earlier, had to do in great part I am sure with the act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.355" offset="7971387">Nobody was going to give up the control of that debt to Argentina so that any kind of currency regulation or any kind of exchange regulation could make the bonds worthless with one stroke of the pen.</text>

            <text syncTime="2103.679" offset="8556635">We submit that Argentina is subject to suit based on its failure to honor debt instruments that it issued to private creditors and that are payable in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.525" offset="8592057">The initial question here is whether Argentina has engaged in a commercial activity, and we think there is little room to dispute that Argentina's issuance of Bonods is just such an activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.552" offset="8632076">As Argentina acknowledges, a Bonod is a debt instrument issued to private creditors that entitles the holder to repayment of principal with interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.737" offset="8664886">It does not differ in its essential terms from a bond or debt instrument that a business corporation might issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.193" offset="8690695">When Argentina issued its Bonods it borrowed money in the international debt market and it thereby engaged in a commercial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.736" offset="8720893">That conclusion is especially compelling here where Argentina issued its Bonods as substitutes for payment of preexisting private commercial obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.291" offset="8755061">At bottom Argentina really does not challenge the commercial character of the debt instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.707" offset="8776795">Rather it simply argues that it had a public purpose in issuing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.761" offset="8792991">As the lower courts correctly pointed out, however, the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act instructs that the commercial character of an activity must be judged on the basis of its nature rather than its purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2415.150" offset="9802467">There are actually three types of connections that would subject a commercial activity to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.006" offset="9825977">One, if it takes place in the United States, two, if an act in connection with the activity takes place in the United States, or three, if there is an act outside the territory of the United States that has a direct effect in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.057" offset="9890134">Now in this case the way that the respondents have structured their complaint, and they are masters of their complaint in this context, is that the commercial activity is the issuance of the Bonods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.277" offset="9943005">The act outside the territory of the United States is the rescheduling of the debt payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.531" offset="9968083">The direct effect in the United States is the breach of the obligation to pay here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.905" offset="9985533">Now, as the Justices alluded to earlier, this could also conceivably fit into the second clause of the provision, particularly if you're willing to look to the legislative history and the House report that notes that an omission can be treated as an act for purposes of the second clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.297" offset="10059094">But in any event it's true that these three clauses do overlap to some extent, and that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.673" offset="10088560">But we think that this case fits squarely in the third clause, without regard to whether it fits in the first or second clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.418" offset="10115623">Now... and I think the reason for this should be quite clear, that creditors lend money in the expectation that they're going to be repaid, and the choice of the place of payment is central to their expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.815" offset="10161180">And simply put it is the place of performance of the debtor's contractual obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.489" offset="10179884">Now, when a debtor breaches its repayment obligation it has a direct effect at the designated place of performance because that is where the breach of the contract takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.105" offset="10214365">Thus it is proper to conclude that Argentina's breach of its obligation or of the Bonods has a direct effect here in the United States, which was designated by Argentina as the place of performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.282" offset="10259087">Now this is also consistent with conflict of law principles if one were to look to the second restatement or the first restatement of conflicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.208" offset="10290747">Both of those cases indicate that the applicable law would be determined on the basis of the place of performance in the case of a debt transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.615" offset="10324393">That would be section 195 of the second restatement, and section 370 of the first restatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.340" offset="10347276">So it's hardly odd to suggest that the place of performance shouldn't also not be the significant legal effect for purposes of the FSIA and for purposes of determining jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.735" offset="10388863">Moreover, this conclusion reflects the realities of the international debt market where the party's choice of place of payment determines the value and marketability of the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.813" offset="10437138">An international debt has increased risk and diminished value if it is payable at a location where there is political upheaval, currency exchange restrictions, or inadequate resources or mechanisms for settling the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.790" offset="10481023">In that case of the example that Mr. Davis gave of a transaction between a Tunisian and Algerian businessmen, they might well decide that the place of payment should be in New York rather than in Tunis, Algiers, or perhaps Tripoli, because that is the one place where they can be certain that the rule of law would govern their transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.933" offset="10557614">And that we think is central to the United States' interest in this case, the fact that the rule of law does apply to commercial transactions carried out in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.018" offset="10593977">Now, when a foreign state makes its debt instruments payable in the United States, United States currency, it is purposely availing itself of the stability of the United States as a commercial forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.517" offset="10635982">It should therefore be subject to the forum's legal rules which preserve that stability and the value of the debts that are payable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2680.267" offset="10862934">I would... no, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.077" offset="10870248">I would not phrase it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.140" offset="10878503">But I would say that Congress here was concerned that, in the fact that the rule of law would apply to commercial transactions that have a substantial connection with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.029" offset="10926045">And in the case of a transaction of a debt that is payable in the United States that is a substantial connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.334" offset="10947257">It is a direct effect in the United States when such a transaction is breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.055" offset="10962094">Now Argentina's approach, which would require a court to ascertain the effect of a foreign state's breach by examining where the creditor suffers its economic loss, would produce an unpredictable and we think unworkable standard for resolving the jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.786" offset="11017056">That is particularly true in the case of negotiable instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.179" offset="11030640">Under Argentina's approach a foreign state would be unable to assess its own immunity or its own amenability to suits in this country at the time that it issued its debt instrument and thereafter, after it is exchanged to other persons hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.886" offset="11085497">In sum, we submit this case provides an opportunity to state a clear rule applicable to a broad category of cases, and the rule should be this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.313" offset="11123218">A foreign state is not immune from suits in the courts of this country if it breaches a contractual obligation to repay a debt instrument that can be held by a private creditor and is payable in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.392" offset="11171492">That rule is not only consistent with the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, but it would also provide definitive guidance to foreign states in structuring their debt offerings and determining their amenability to suit in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="2779.100" offset="11258323">I think in terms of the direct effect test that the position that has been articulated here in terms of the, by the U.S. amicus, really confuses jurisdiction with choice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.378" offset="11307433">This Court in a number of opinions has, when it considered whether there would be jurisdiction, has made a distinction and said that the fact that the operation of the center of gravity or other tests would produce a particular choice of law does not mean that there would be jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2807.627" offset="11372426">Well, I think the Government's point is sort of an a fortiori point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.640" offset="11388517">It's very rare that you would have enough contact with the transaction to impose your law upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.624" offset="11412445">That is to have legislative jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.317" offset="11419133">But not have enough contact is simply have adjudicated jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2823.741" offset="11436896">Well, I think that, Justice Scalia, if you look though at the way the courts have dealt with place of payment cases, the general jurisdictional rule under the long arm statutes and that Congress did reference that it intended essentially to be treating sovereigns similar to the way they would be treated under long arm statutes under this provision, would be the place of payment would not be sufficient to reach somebody under a long arm statute for jurisdictional purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.290" offset="11547028">And I think that in the various decisions of this Court when it looked at the choice of law issue it really said the choice of law question becomes significant when the party, and this I think was referenced in the Burger King decision, when the party agrees in the contract to a choice of law, that's something that is when it is more significant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.719" offset="11888814">The fact is, at least when we're dealing with a question of jurisdiction as between two domestic states, we can assume that there is in fact going to be a court somewhere that can deal with the issue, and in a way which we will assume would be commercially effective although you may have to travel to get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.994" offset="11973869">And it seems to me that the point of this transaction indicates that that is an assumption that is not necessarily to be made when we're dealing with... in international transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2969.190" offset="12018695">Well, I think that in the international context I would think it actually, Justice Souter, would go the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.575" offset="12044191">Indeed in the majority opinion of this Court in Asahi, in a constitutional context when it felt there was a close case, the fact that it was a foreign national, albeit not a government, that would be brought into the United States was considered a factor against jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.518" offset="12112005">And the fact that it was a foreign plaintiff, while maybe not decisive, was also referenced specifically in that opinion as being a factor against jurisdiction in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.606" offset="12220360">But if, it certainly we would say is not a direct effect within the contemplation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.202" offset="12242721">And I think there's an opinion that was originally written by Judge Weinfeld in the Verlinden case when he, at the district court level, which I really think very effectively presented that position in much more articulate terms than I can.</text>
