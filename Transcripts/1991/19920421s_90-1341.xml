            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="11.582" offset="137158">Each of these cases comes to us on writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.115" offset="163280">The cases grew out of Ohio suit alleging that in operating a nuclear fuel processing plant located in Ohio, the Department of Energy had violated the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as well as state environmental laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.564" offset="233080">The United States concedes that when and if it is found liable under either of those federal statutes, it is liable for coercive fines imposed prospectively to induce it to comply with the orders directing it to refrain from statutory violations in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.579" offset="309148">Now, the issue before us, however, is whether either of the federal statutes also waves the Federal Government's sovereign immunity from liability for punitive fines penalizing past failures to comply with federal and state environmental laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.493" offset="364841">The Sixth Circuit held that both statutes waive federal immunity from such punitive fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.213" offset="387620">In an opinion filed today, we reverse and hold that neither the Clean Water Act nor the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act waives federal sovereign immunity from liability for such punitive fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.549" offset="441014">The arguments that the statutes do waive the government's sovereign immunity from those fines are directed to two sections in each statute, its provision for citizen suits and its section dealing specifically with federal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.948" offset="494618">The citizen suit sections of both the Clean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or RCRA authorize suits against the United States and empower courts to impose civil penalties in accordance with the civil penalty sections of the respective statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.171" offset="567551">Because however, those civil penalty sections do not provide for any fines against the United States, the citizen suit sections which incorporate them do not waive federal sovereign immunity from punitive fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.184" offset="615512">The section of the Clean Water Act requiring federal facilities to comply with federal and state water pollution likewise fails to waive the government's immunity from punitive fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.574" offset="657099">In light of our rule, construing such waivers narrowly, that section's provision subjecting the United States to "process and sanctions" is too uncertain to permit the conclusion that it waived federal immunity from punitive as well as coercive fines and textual indicators suggest that the Congress did not intend a waiver broad enough to cover the punitive fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.535" offset="756991">The analogous section in RCRA also fails to provide the waiver Ohio seeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.514" offset="776845">Like its counterpart in the Clean Water Act, this section waives federal immunity from sanctions but the context of the waiver makes it clear that it is not intended to extend the punitive fines designed to punish past noncompliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.176" offset="839538">Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens have joined.</text>
