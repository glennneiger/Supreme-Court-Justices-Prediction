            <text syncTime="19.194" offset="76696">Ms. Kolbert.</text>

          <turn speaker="kathryn_kolbert" startTime="22.545" stopTime="491.100">
            <label>Ms. Kathryn Kolbert</label>
            <text syncTime="22.545" offset="90175">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="28.011" offset="112013">Whether our Constitution endows Government with the power to force a woman to continue or to end a pregnancy against her will is the central question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.338" offset="153287">Since this Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, a generation of American women have come of age secure in the knowledge that the Constitution provides the highest level of protection for their child-bearing decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.066" offset="204173">This landmark decision, which necessarily and logically flows from a century of this Court's jurisprudence, not only protects rights of bodily integrity and autonomy, but has enabled millions of women to participate fully and equally in society.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.670" offset="270629">The genius of Roe and the Constitution is that it fully protects rights of fundamental importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.194" offset="300722">Government may not chip away at fundamental rights, nor make them selectively available only to the most privileged women.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.778" offset="331024">If the right to choose abortion remains fundamental as established in Roe v. Wade, the strict scrutiny standard is applicable, and as this Court found in Akron and in Thornburgh, Pennsylvania's onerous restrictions must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.773" offset="391001">Should this Court abandon strict scrutiny, as urged by the Commonwealth and the Solicitor, not only might Pennsylvania's egregious intrusions on privacy stand and a century of this Court's privacy decisions may also be dismantled.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.492" offset="457874">Equally disturbing, should this Court remove fundamental protection for the abortion right, women might again be forced to the back alleys for their medical care with grave consequences for their lives and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.567" offset="514194">The Commonwealth argues that this Court may overrule Akron and Thornburgh and abandon strict scrutiny and nevertheless preserve Roe's central meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.357" offset="557349">While politically expedient, this view is certainly not based upon this Court's privacy jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.683" offset="582635">Every other brief filed in this case agrees that the protection offered by Roe's heightened scrutiny lies at the core of this important decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.987" offset="619938">To abandon heightened review is to overrule Roe.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.743" offset="634880">This Court has repeatedly held that the doctrine of stare decisis is of fundamental importance to the rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.709" offset="670824">Fidelity to precedent ensures that our law will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion, and that our guiding rules are founded in law rather than in the proclivities of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.904" offset="719517">Accordingly, this Court has established that departure from precedent must be supported by some special justification, but no special justification exists here.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.288" offset="765074">Only 9 years ago in Akron, this Court invoked the doctrine of stare decisis and expressly reaffirmed Roe v. Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.473" offset="797884">Only 3 years later, in Thornburgh, a case that is virtually identical to that before this Court today, this Court again found especially compelling reasons to reaffirm Roe and to find Pennsylvania law unconstitutional under the standard of strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.231" offset="872908">Nothing has changed since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.921" offset="883670">Indeed, millions of women continue to rely on the fundamental rights guaranteed in Roe v. Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.398" offset="909584">The medical conditions that led this Court to create and establish these fundamental rights remain the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.054" offset="948140">This case, the statute, the parties, are nearly identical to those in Thornburgh.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.924" offset="971651">Never before has this Court bestowed and taken back a fundamental right that has been part of the settled rights and expectations of literally millions of Americans for nearly two decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.220" offset="1024836">To regress now by permitting States suddenly to impose burdensome regulations, or to criminalize conduct, would be incompatible with any notion of principled constitutional decision-making.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.557" offset="1078126">Roe is both soundly based in the Constitution and sets forth a fair and workable standard of adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.672" offset="1118668">From as early as 1891, this Court has recognized that the rights of autonomy, bodily integrity, and equality are central to our notions of ordered liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.984" offset="1163912">Roe lies at the heart of those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.885" offset="1175510">While pregnancy may be a blessed act when planned or wanted, forced pregnancy, like any forced bodily invasion, is anathema to American values and traditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.768" offset="1218978">In the same way that it would be unacceptable for Government to force a man or a woman to donate bone marrow, or to compel the contribution of a kidney to another, or to compel women to undergo abortion or forced sterilization, our Constitution protects women against forced pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.626" offset="1298495">If anything, because forced pregnancy will jeopardize a woman's life or health, the constitutional protections ought to be greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.686" offset="1334648">The Solicitor tries to draw a distinction between constitutional protection against forced abortion, which he agrees is fundamental, and constitutional protection against forced pregnancy, which he maligns, but once this Court removes fundamental status from the abortion right, there is no logical stopping point.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.204" offset="1428793">Fundamental status for all reproductive rights, decisions about birth control, pregnancy, sterilization, even high technology around reproduction, may also be jeopardized.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.146" offset="1476545">Particularly where there is no bright line between abortion and some methods of birth control, the fundamental right both to prevent pregnancy and to end pregnancy may be at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.407" offset="1525551">Our Nation's history and tradition also respects the autonomy of individuals to make life choices consistent with their own moral and conscientious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.229" offset="1572885">Our Constitution has long recognized an individual's right to make private and intimate decisions about marriage and family life, the upbringing of children, the ability to use contraception.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.230" offset="1628891">The decision to terminate a pregnancy or to carry it to term is no different in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.888" offset="1655536">Both the Solicitor and some Commonwealth amici argue that the Constitution only protects private decision-making within families.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.874" offset="1691481">It is true that the rights of privacy have been recognized in the familial context.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.605" offset="1714364">For example, in Griswold the Court found unconstitutional the Connecticut statute that prohibited married persons from using birth control and in Loving this Court found invalid a Virginia statute that prohibited the marriage of interracial couples.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.305" offset="1781133">Nevertheless, this Court has never limited the notions of privacy recognized in these cases as only arising or belonging to married couples.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.631" offset="1822511">Indeed, in Eisenstadt and in Carey this Court specifically rejected this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.323" offset="1849260">Nor can this Court alter its historic recognition of privacy and deny women fundamental freedoms because, as the Solicitor argues, the woman is not isolated in her privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.505" offset="1905998">Surely if the Government cannot require individuals to sacrifice their lives or health for others or for other compelling purposes, it cannot require women to sacrifice their lives and health to further the State's interest in potential life.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.100" offset="1964304">Ms. Kolbert, you're arguing the case as though all we have before us is whether to apply stare decisis and preserve Roe v. Wade in all its aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.620" offset="2018429">Nevertheless, we granted certiorari on some specific questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.330" offset="2041313">Do you plan to address any of those in your argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="514.086" offset="2056255">Your Honor, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.112" offset="2060434">However, the central question in the case is what is the standard that this Court uses to evaluate the restrictions that are at issue, and therefore one cannot--</text>

            <text syncTime="527.212" offset="2108813">Well, the standard may affect the outcome or it may not, but at bottom we still have to deal with specific issues, and I wondered if you were going to address them.</text>

          <turn speaker="kathryn_kolbert" startTime="537.255" stopTime="697.258">
            <label>Ms. Kathryn Kolbert</label>
            <text syncTime="537.255" offset="2148937">--Yes, I am, Your Honor, and I would like in particular to address the husband notification provisions, but the standard that this Court applies will well establish the outcome in this case for a variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.876" offset="2207451">This Court has already found that under the principles of Roe v. Wade the bulk of the Pennsylvania statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.730" offset="2238903">There is no question that this Court struck down as unconstitutional under strict scrutiny the bias counseling provisions and the 24-hour mandatory delay both in Thornburgh and in Akron, the case in 1983, and therefore this Court must examine first the question of what's the appropriate standard before determining the constitutionality of those other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.430" offset="2333675">The Court cannot alter its historic recognition of privacy and deny women fundamental freedoms, as I was speaking, because as the Solicitor argues, there is the presence of the fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.481" offset="2413923">Surely, if the Government cannot require individuals to sacrifice their lives or health for human beings who are born for other compelling purposes, they cannot do so for purposes of protecting potential fetal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.137" offset="2476513">And if this Court is to reduce the presence of a constitutional right merely because of the presence of the fetus, other childbearing decisions, whether they be the right to carry the pregnancy to term or make other childbearing decisions will be particularly affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.229" offset="2556865">Particularly here, as this Court noted in Roe where there is widespread disagreement in both a philosophical and a religious sense about when life begins, this Court cannot sanction one view to the detriment of women's lives and health; nor can the state of the law in 1868 define or determine constitutional rights for all future generations.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.899" offset="2667520">This Court must look generally to whether a right is reflected in our Nation's history and traditions rather than at whether the activity was illegal at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.988" offset="2715899">Relying exclusively on what 50 States have legislated in determining the scope of liberty would imperil numerous freedoms such as rights recognized by this Court in Brown, Bolling, Griswold and Loving.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.086" offset="2772323">This Court has also recognized as--</text>

            <text syncTime="736.790" offset="2947135">--Well, this Court is... if the Court was only to look at whether abortion was illegal in 1868, that is at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it would be placed in a very difficult situation because at the time of the founding of the Nation, at the time that the Constitution was adopted, abortion was legal.</text>

            <text syncTime="761.952" offset="3047758">Well, we think that the Court ought to look generally at the principles that this decision protects.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.336" offset="3073254">That while it is important to look... and I would not urge you to ignore the state of the law at different periods of our history, it is only one factor in a variety of factors that this Court has to look to in determining whether or not something is fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.596" offset="3150367">And fundamental status in this instance derives from a history of this Court's acknowledgement and acceptance that private, autonomous decisions made by women in the privacy of their families ought to be respected and accorded fundamental status.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.108" offset="3220376">Certainly, the anomalous posture of the fact that abortion was legal at the time of the founding of the Constitution and then illegal at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment would place this Court in a very difficult position, that is, rights may be guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment and not the Fourteenth, merely because only the exact state of the law in 1868 is the factor that the Court accepts.</text>

            <text syncTime="838.436" offset="3353704">I think you would have said the mere fact that most States disfavor abortion is no justification for this Court's saying that it is not therefore included within it.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.406" offset="3413577">I would, and that is the argument that this Court has made in many instances in rejecting exactly the state of the law prior to the granting of fundamental status.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.530" offset="3462060">That is, this Court, if we were only to look at whether State legislatures prohibited activity in determining whether or not an activity is fundamental, many of the most precious rights that we now have: rights to travel, rights to vote, rights to be free from racial segregation would not be accorded status because in fact, State legislators have acted to inhibit those rights at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.756" offset="3642932">The debate centers on what is the meaning of that term liberty, and we think that the precedence of this Court that began at the end of the 19th Century and have proceeded from this Court to the very present, would logically and necessarily include fundamental rights to decide whether to carry a pregnancy to term or to terminate that pregnancy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.160" offset="4712594">That is, potential fetal life is a recognized value, is a recognized State interest after the point of viability; but when in conflict, when the woman's health interest is in conflict with those State interests and potential life, those women's interest, the women's interest in health take precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.253" offset="4792947">Now admittedly, the question of viability and the viability line is not as present in this case as it has been in many of the other cases that this Court has seen before here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.820" offset="4851252">That is, all of the restrictions that are issue in Pennsylvania attach in pregnancy at the very beginning of pregnancy, and therefore, the State's interest in protection of fetal life really does not come into play.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.828" offset="4959295">And frankly, this Court need only look to the record, that is, need only look to the findings of the district court to determine that this statute in no way furthers women's health interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.348" offset="5013316">That in fact, what this statute does is cause a detriment to women's health, submit her to increased dangers as a result of delay, as a result of interference with the doctor/patient relationship, as a result of permitting third parties who would injure individuals who are required to give husband notification, that those interests in health are not furthered in any respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.561" offset="5222191">For the woman who has become pregnant as a result of marital rape, obtaining information from her doctor that her husband may be liable for child support is both cruel and oppressive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.324" offset="5273287">To find these restrictions reasonable, this Court would have to ignore the facts placed in evidence in this case which demonstrate that the restrictions were not enacted to improve women's decision making or health care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.929" offset="5327621">After listening to the testimony of ten witnesses, including those proffered by the Commonwealth, the district court made 387 findings of fact and repeatedly concluded that the Pennsylvania restrictions will interfere with the ability of physicians to provide quality medical care and will delay and discourage the performance of abortion to further no legitimate State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.068" offset="5428245">In particular, the lower court found that the mandatory husband notification provisions will have dangerous and potentially deadly consequences for battered women, likening force notification in a battering situation to providing the husband with a hammer with which to beat his wife.</text>

            <text syncTime="1413.558" offset="5654152">Nor can there be, for under rule 52 the district court's findings are not clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.409" offset="5681633">Nor did the fact that this is a facial challenge require petitioners to prove that the statute cannot be constitutionally applied to any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.088" offset="5720294">This Court had repeatedly found statutes facially invalid after looking at facts like those present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.271" offset="5749029">For example in Hodgson, this Court relied extensively on district court findings to strike down Minnesota's two parent notification statute with no bypass, despite the fact that that statute had never yet been in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.496" offset="5805976">The extensive record here demonstrates that the harms are not speculative nor remote, nor is this a worst case scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.109" offset="5840353">The Court should not demand an unwanted child or a woman maimed by an illegal abortion as proof that strict scrutiny is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.777" offset="5879014">Pennsylvania women should not be the guinea pigs in the State's experiment with constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.148" offset="5904509">To find otherwise would totally eviscerate the strict scrutiny standard of review, and would prevent Federal courts from scrutinizing legislative findings, a central role in the process of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.836" offset="5955291">Let me turn now to... specifically to the husband notification provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.970" offset="5979847">There is little doubt that these provisions violate the fundamental right of privacy, marital integrity and equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.456" offset="6017776">Beginning as early as Danforth, this Court recognized that a husband cannot arbitrarily veto the childbearing decisions of his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.471" offset="6049855">Like the Missouri law at issue in Danforth, State mandated communication between husbands and wives violates the autonomy of married women to make personal and private decisions, particularly here where a married woman is often the survivor of martial rape and where the penalty for transgressing her husband is likely to be physical violence against her or her family members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.179" offset="6144627">Government has the obligation to respect her private decisions, not to involve her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.879" offset="6167510">The solicitor dismisses the import of the State-imposed harm and believes or claims that the Constitution is not intended to remedy them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.793" offset="6211082">But this approach seriously ignores that women will be seriously maimed and that harms will be invoked, and it is a callous disregard for their lives and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.972" offset="6263850">While it may be desireable for husbands and wives to share intimacies in their daily life, the concepts of this Court developed in the principles of marital integrity ensure that the Government cannot decree for those couples how that communication should occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.598" offset="6334380">To decree and direct family life is more destructive of family integrity than permitting families to resolve their differences on their own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.202" offset="6372728">The husband notification provisions also violate principles of equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.739" offset="6390909">These are provisions that apply to women and women alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.146" offset="6408568">Imposed notification is... gives a benefit only to men, and as such they violate the dictates of the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.066" offset="6456216">The legislative scheme that assumes that husbands are capable and authorized to make all independent decisions but wives are not, reflect an outmoded common law view that women, once married, lost their legal identities to their husbands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.369" offset="6521417">In the days before Roe, thousands of women lost their lives and more were subjected to physical and emotional scars from back alley and self-induced abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.860" offset="6563422">Recognizing that, this Court established Roe and established fundamental protection for women's childbearing decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.640" offset="6594560">We urge this Court to reaffirm those principles today, to adopt the rulings of this Court in Akron and Thornburgh that used the Roe strict scrutiny standard, and affirm in part and reverse in part, the judgment of the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.929" offset="6655687">I would like to reserve 3 minutes for rebuttal, if there's no further questions from the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.327" offset="11533270">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.979" offset="11563886">In view of what has been discussed, let me address very briefly three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.769" offset="11595024">The first is the standard of review which has been the subject of considerable discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.690" offset="11618743">In a number of its cases over the last 20 years in the abortion area, the Court has articulated the governing standard of review in different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.534" offset="11666077">And as a result, there is confusion in the law as to how legislatures, if they choose, can legislate, and how judges are to judge in this extraordinarily sensitive and divisive area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.337" offset="11729293">In our view, the correct articulation of that standard is to be found in the Webster plurality opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.294" offset="11769104">That standard has deep roots.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.921" offset="11783628">It finds its roots in a long line of due process cases that do not involve liberty interests which, by virtue of the nation's history and its legal traditions, rise to the level of fundamental rights to a free people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.085" offset="11856248">This is the process of analysis that is quite familiar to the Court, very lengthily laid out by Justice Harlan in his dissent in Poe versus Ullman, and then adumbrated in his concurring opinion in Griswold against Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.153" offset="11932526">Second, and relatedly, with all respect, we do not believe that stare decisis considerations weigh against the Court providing that needed clarification as to the standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3515.548" offset="14062132">Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to address two points very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.259" offset="14101002">The first is in response to this last dialogue with General Starr.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.520" offset="14134021">Recognition of a State's interest in fetal life as compelling throughout pregnancy would denigrate and restrict the ability of women at all stages of pregnancy to have an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.716" offset="14210821">And certainly in the only exception that the Mr. Starr and the Solicitor General has laid out for this Court, is in the very rare instance where only the life of the woman would be excluded from a ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.294" offset="14273097">Bans of second trimester abortions, bans of certain classes of women having abortions, bans that would prevent women who have serious and long lasting health needs to have abortions, would be significantly approved by this Court if the rational basis standard were adopted, precisely because of a formulation that the State's interest is compelling throughout pregnancy and sufficient to override any liberty interests, any interests of the woman to choose or not choose a pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.702" offset="14430772">And, in fact, that is why this Court must go back to the hallmark of Roe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.756" offset="14458984">That is again reaffirm that the right to choose abortion is fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.510" offset="14481972">And only when the Government can show a compelling purpose... as recognized in Roe that is, a compelling purpose after the point of viability... should it be able to sustain a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.112" offset="14532441">The second point I wanted to raise goes to the question of the rights by numbers approach articulated by the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.341" offset="14565355">It is our view that the husband notification statute applies to every single married woman in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.855" offset="14599419">That the rights of autonomy, the rights of communication within the family, are infringed because those communications are subject to criminal prosecution, and subject to independent district attorneys subpoenaing women and probing the communications between husband and wife.</text>
