            <text syncTime="10.669" offset="187678">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.527" offset="199067">This case involves the constitutional right to a speedy trial in a situation where the defendant, the petitioner herein, had absolutely no knowledge of the existence of an indictment for a period of 8-1/2 years prior to being arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.660" offset="259671">For the last 6 years of that 8-1/2 years, it was clear that Mr. Doggett was available to the push of a button, running a credit check, to determine his whereabouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.266" offset="310035">Eight-and-a-half years after his indictment the United States Marshals Service, in conducting an operation entitled WANT II, which commenced on September 1 of 1988, pushed a button on a credit bureau computer in the Savannah office of the Marshal's Office and within 5 minutes found that Marc Doggett resided in Reston, Virginia, where he had been residing openly, freely, and above-board for the last 6 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.923" offset="444723">The Government's efforts immediately after the indictment of Mr. Doggett demonstrates bad faith which constitutes prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.514" offset="483070">Shortly after Mr. Doggett's indictment, two State officials, at the request of the Jacksonville, Florida, DEA, went to his parents' home in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.196" offset="529777">Mr. Doggett's mother is a Colombian national who's been married to an American citizen for many years and has three children.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.225" offset="557885">These two State officials, at the request of the Federal Government, dropped by her house one time in 8-1/2 years to determine where Mr. Doggett was.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.141" offset="597591">Mrs. Doggett immediately notified these officers that he had left for Colombia, and indeed gave him the flight number of his airplane in Miami, Florida, and the fact that he was updating his passport on his way.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.135" offset="665510">The record is absolutely clear, and both the magistrate, the district court, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, found that Mr. Doggett had no knowledge of his indictment through his mother or anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.099" offset="713366">Indeed, the United States in the plea agreement entered into with Mr. Doggett stated that Mr. Doggett had no knowledge of the indictment and indeed the two co-defendants, who were apprehended and tried in 1980, had had no contact with Mr. Doggett.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.966" offset="784837">So the record is without question that Mr. Doggett had absolutely no knowledge of this indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.619" offset="839485">The reason I do not accept that is that probably a year-and-a-half after Mr. Doggett was indicted he was arrested in the country of Panama and he was incarcerated there for 8 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.940" offset="880759">During that 8-month period, the DEA knew that he was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.159" offset="897582">The State Department visited Mr. Doggett on periodic basis during that 8-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.547" offset="919211">Unfortunately, the State Department and the DEA didn't communicate with each other, and no one, including the State Department officials that visited him on numerous occasions, gave him notice of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.058" offset="961216">Thereafter, he was released in 1982 and returned to this country after a couple of months visiting family in Colombia.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.585" offset="1003325">As long as 2 years... 32 months, 38 months, the DEA agent in Jacksonville, based on information that he had received in 1981, fabricated three DEA 6 reports stating that Marc Doggett was still incarcerated in the country of Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.951" offset="1092768">These fabricated reports caused the United States to exert no further effort to obtain the apprehension of Mr. Doggett, to his detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.963" offset="1136863">Mr. Doggett returned to the United States, using his own name, through JFK Airport in New York City and returned to North Carolina for a brief period of time living with a grandmother, and then became married, obtained an AA degree, has had numerous jobs, had many credit cards, bought two houses, paid United States income tax, and made no effort to conceal his identity, which is--</text>

            <text syncTime="278.044" offset="1257131">Mr. Sheppard, cases from this Court dealing with the speedy trial clause have identified two concerns that are behind the provisions of the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.364" offset="1330483">One is the anxiety factor of someone who is aware of the indictment, and nothing has happened, and secondly the loss of liberty pending trial if someone's incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.029" offset="1397147">Now, we don't have either of those things at play here.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.329" offset="1550329">--Indeed, the courts below did not find actual prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.561" offset="1567257">However, we submit that that was an erroneous analysis of this record, and I'd like to communicate why Mr. Doggett was prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.759" offset="1611978">Number one, there were 17 tapes made in the 1979, '80 time period when this case was investigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.100" offset="1641444">Mr. Doggett was involved in... very peripherally in a large... what turned out to be a large cocaine transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.221" offset="1677911">The Government in their brief, and I suspect in their argument, will attempt to lead you to believe that he was involved in a 40-kilogram cocaine transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.749" offset="1711975">That would belie the record if one reviews the record closely.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.169" offset="1725663">He pled... entered a conditional plea involving 5.7 grams of cocaine, and the Eleventh Circuit opinion affirming the conviction of the two co-defendants in 1982 explicitly indicated that there was no involvement by Mr. Doggett.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.241" offset="1785954">Now, the prejudice that Mr. Doggett suffered was, number one, there were 17 tapes that were missing, and 8-1/2 years later it's hard to say (1) were the tapes totally blank, (2) whose voices were on the tape, (3) did the content of the tapes... would they have exonerated Mr. Doggett?</text>
            <text syncTime="429.657" offset="1863590">Another factor was that the moving force in this investigation was a confidential informant named Ivan Cifuentes.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.260" offset="1909983">Ivan Cifuentes at the time of the hearing on the motion to dismiss in this case had not been communicated with by the DEA for a 1-1/2 year period, and as DEA Agent Driver stated, he, along with the tapes, was, quote, "missing in action", end quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.942" offset="1980723">The court... the Eleventh Circuit found that that witness was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.267" offset="1998068">If the Eleventh Circuit reviewed the record closely, as was their obligation, they would have not made that finding, because he was not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.248" offset="2041954">He had entered the witness protection program, had voluntarily withdrawn, and Agent Driver had not communicated with him or had any information of his whereabouts for at least a year-and-a-half period.</text>
