            <text syncTime="11.027" offset="134953">These two suits under Section 5 of the Voting Ranks Act were commenced in a three-judge District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, and the consolidated cases are now here on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.719" offset="181660">Each suit concerns a county road commission in rural Alabama, one in Etowah County and the other in Russell County.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.704" offset="213634">The Commission members are elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.415" offset="220425">In each of these counties, there was litigation to change the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.342" offset="240174">And as a result, the first black members in modern times were elected to the road commissions in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.662" offset="265460">Those electoral changes are not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.571" offset="277059">Instead, the suits challenge changes in the decision making authority and the decision structure of the commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.417" offset="304435">The black commission members who brought these suits claim that these changes had the effect of diminishing the rule and the real power of the elected members.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.672" offset="341529">In Etowah County, the Commission altered its prior practice of delegating to each member of the Commission the authority to determine how funds allocated to his particular road district should be spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.077" offset="383116">And under the new system, decisions of this sort are made by the Commission as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.170" offset="399521">In Russell County, the Commission altered its earlier practice of granting the Commissioner's individual authority for road and bridge repair and construction within their separate residency districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.795" offset="441944">Under the new system in Russell County, these responsibilities were transferred to the County Engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.607" offset="461274">He was an official appointed by the Commission and responsible to it, but he made all of the routine decisions respecting construction and road repair countywide.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.349" offset="508190">The plaintiffs sued the County Commissions to enjoin these changes on the basis that they were covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.939" offset="550613">The Act provides, in covered jurisdictions, that any change with respect to voting must be submitted to the United States Attorney General for approval before it may be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.361" offset="588229">These changes had not been submitted to the Attorney General and the District Court held that the County Commissions could implement the changes because they were not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.641" offset="625323">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we now affirm the judgment of the District Court though we adapt a different rationale to determine the question, what constitutes a change with respect to voting as that term is used in the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="146.340" offset="676210">The commissioners who sue argue that these changes in decision making structure reduced their net authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.827" offset="698153">It follows, they contend, that a vote cast for individual commissioners was made less valuable and so there was a change with respect to voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.231" offset="731694">The United States as amicus curiae agrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.130" offset="743292">It asks us to adapt a rule embracing the routine actions of state and local governments at all levels so that this case has significance well beyond these two County Commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.436" offset="784566">We reject the position of the appellants and of the United States because it has no basis in the statute and provides no workable standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.344" offset="812151">Were we to accept the appellant's reading of Section 5, we would work an unconstrained expansion of the statutory coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.101" offset="839214">Innumerable state and local enactments having nothing to do with voting, affects the power of elected officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.379" offset="864291">The appellants and the United States failed to provide a workable distinction between changes in rules governing voting and changes in the routine organization and functioning of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.821" offset="906087">Some standard is necessary for in a real sense, every decision taken by a democratic government implicates voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.567" offset="933046">Yet, no one would contend that when Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act it meant to subject all or even most decisions of government in covered jurisdictions to federal supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.952" offset="970662">Rather, the Act by its terms covers any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard practice or procedure with respect to voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.965" offset="1006711">The changes now at issue are not covered by this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.756" offset="1017787">And on this rationale, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.312" offset="1032102">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices White and Blackmun join.</text>
