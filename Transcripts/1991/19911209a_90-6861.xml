            <label>Mr. Paul M. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="22.116" offset="240210">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.288" offset="244912">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="24.991" offset="251704">This case involves a Bivens action that was dismissed on the grounds that the Federal prisoner who brought the action had not exhausted the Bureau of Prisons grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.206" offset="292560">Now, in seeking reversal of that ruling, we are not contending that Bivens plaintiffs could never be required to exhaust an appropriate administrative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.312" offset="329027">Here, however, there are two key features of the existing grievance procedure that in our view make it fundamentally ill-suited to being the first stage of Bivens litigation by Federal prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.338" offset="377092">First, that grievance process provides no remedy whatever to a potential plaintiff seeking compensation for a past constitutional injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.491" offset="413768">Second, the procedure contains a series of mandatory hurdles, beginning with a 15-day filing deadline, that create a very high risk of inadvertent forfeiture of constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.454" offset="465595">Now, these features of the grievance process are not surprising in light of its origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.172" offset="488478">What we have here is a process that was created to provide an informal outlet for any and all inmate complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.105" offset="516168">It's not limited to legal claims, it contains no standards that have to be applied, and it creates no right to anything other than a written response.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.367" offset="549187">It's basically an opportunity for a dialogue with prison administrators.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="103.506" offset="565801">If there is an adequate administrative remedy, then is there a Bivens option at all?</text>

            <text syncTime="111.800" offset="598924">Well, Your Honor, I think there could be a situation where you would have an administrative remedy that would be adequate enough to justify exhaustion, but not so comprehensive that you would want to give it--</text>

            <text syncTime="122.906" offset="643436">But there's an analogy, certainly, under the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act, where Congress has mandated under certain circumstances exhaustion by State prisoners in 1983 actions, but still left in place the opportunity to go to court thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.758" offset="694741">And I think if you had a process similar to what is mandated in CRIPA you could have a process, for example, that offers $2,000 in damages and doesn't have a lot of due process, but still has some reason to exhaust it and still say people should be able to go to court thereafter.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.125" offset="800276">He's not in prison anywhere at this moment, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.951" offset="811561">He left Federal custody last spring.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>

            <label>Mr. Paul M. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="171.120" offset="836220">This case entirely involves damages, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.745" offset="846774">There was never any claim for anything else in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.883" offset="859312">Now, consider what happens when you take this informal process that I described, this dialogue process, and you import it into the Bivens litigation system and say it has to be pursued in every case where somebody's trying to get to court on a damages claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.222" offset="912602">Basically what you do at that point is you say, this prisoner who is trying to get compensation for his injury has to exhaust a system that doesn't provide any compensation, and has three tiers of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.639" offset="958264">And I think it's important to get a little bit concrete about how this works in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.826" offset="975087">Imagine a prisoner like petitioner, who is complaining about the medical care he received in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.761" offset="994836">That prisoner might convince the warden that... the initial level of the three levels of the process... that he hasn't in fact been getting very good medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.272" offset="1028899">And the warden might say that in writing in response to the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.286" offset="1040916">But the one... the two things the warden wouldn't do at that point, he wouldn't comment in any way on the legal merits of any constitutional claim for damages, and he certainly wouldn't provide any compensation for any injury received by the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.548" offset="1093996">So at that point you've got your grievance, you've gotten some kind of a response, even a somewhat favorable response, but what are you supposed to do when you're still just trying to get to court on your constitutional claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="245.935" offset="1135479">At that point, apparently, you would have to continue exhausting because you haven't received what you're seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.668" offset="1158467">You'd have to appeal even though you in a sense won at the initial level.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.671" offset="1282496">The complaint that was filed in this case, Your Honor, was limited to a Bivens action against the individual medical personnel in the prison.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul M. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="309.814" offset="1391061">The point I would make in response to the Government's argument about how you should file a grievance, because it might give you a settlement under the Tort Claims Act, is you've got two different procedures here; a grievance procedure that says it's not for tort claims, and the procedure for tort claims, which is an entirely different part of the CFR.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.153" offset="1460338">And what they're saying in kind of a Rube Goldberg thing, is you should go over to this procedure because although it's not for tort claims, we might nevertheless consider it as a tort claim, and on our own initiative offer you a settlement under this other authority over here that you haven't pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.381" offset="1517285">And I think there are several problems with that kind of a theory if you're going to make that the basis for justifying exhaustion of the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.159" offset="1544348">First of all, the petitioner had no way of knowing that he had this golden opportunity to get a settlement offer for damages by filing under the grievance process, which expressly says it's not for tort claims and it doesn't have any damages in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.686" offset="1590532">So there's kind of a notice problem to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.670" offset="1598473">I also think basically the whole scenario is a little bit implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.966" offset="1615610">The idea that these Federal prison officials are sitting around taking these grievances that come in and plucking out those that look meritorious and making on their own initiative settlement offers to people that haven't even made any indication that they want to pursue a legal claim for damages, either under the Tort Claims Act or in court, strikes me as unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.395" offset="1689379">And if it doesn't happen in any significant number of cases, then it certainly doesn't justify putting everybody through this three-level process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.562" offset="5174010">I think they probably could because they already have a regulation that seems to provide settlements to, in cases involving Federal employees, after they're in court... that's 50.15, 28 CFR.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.994" offset="5227717">And I don't know that there's any statutory authority for that either.</text>

            <text syncTime="1463.680" offset="6006480">And I would think at that point you'd want to wait for a pretty strong indication from Congress to get rid of compensation all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.474" offset="6029676">The other point I'd make is it's not like Congress has specifically encouraged grievance procedures or authorized this specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.003" offset="6055799">This is entirely a creation of Bureau of Prisons under statutes which say things like, you're authorized to run the prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.797" offset="6078996">Just one more point about Congress, and then I'll reserve the balance of my time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.687" offset="6098535">I do think it's important to recognize that CRIPA does not support exhaustion in this case for the reasons that I said before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.809" offset="6122986">CRIPA first of all prevents forfeitures of claims because you file in Federal court first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.008" offset="6151825">They then hold the case for 90 days, and say go exhaust there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.804" offset="6163005">So you don't have this inadvertent forfeiture beforehand based on some State law deadline for your grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.552" offset="6185993">And as I said before, the Attorney General took the view when the regulations under CRIPA were put out, that you don't have to exhaust a futile procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.940" offset="6215564">If you have a damages claim, and there are no damages available, then you don't have to exhaust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.094" offset="6232178">So CRIPA, if anything, supports our side in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.938" offset="6243463">The point I'd make is ultimately you... there could be a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.342" offset="6257151">It's just that they haven't created it yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.811" offset="6263002">And there's no reason to rush to borrow this one because it happens to be in the Code of Federal Regulations, even though it's clearly inadequate for the reasons I've stated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2297.938" offset="9343466">And in fact, when he filed his Federal action... the Tenth Circuit's been quite clear on it, Your Honor, for more than 10 years since Brice v. Day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.918" offset="9375440">So this inmate knew, and in fact he fully briefed the issue of the exhaustion cases in other circuits at the time that he went to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.649" offset="9406369">In addition, the judge in this case dismissed his claim for failure to exhaust, telling him he needed to go exhaust before his 15 days had even expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.442" offset="9449523">So he didn't lack notice that he was required to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.862" offset="9463211">And when he filed his grievance with the warden, they didn't reject it because it was a tort claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.407" offset="9485363">They went ahead and considered it on the merits, had a factual investigation, and responded to him saying that they thought what was appropriate was for him to get psychiatric care, and they were making it available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.027" offset="9527890">So it is clear from this record that they have in fact encouraged inmates to use this grievance system and that it has in practice not worked any undue prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2371.782" offset="9638859">On this record, though, it is clear that he cannot say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.640" offset="9654323">He knew he was required to exhaust, the court told him so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.982" offset="9667698">And the warden went ahead and considered his claim, even though it was 2 weeks late.</text>

            <text syncTime="2680.283" offset="10872883">If the prison officials do not know that he was beaten up that day, they have no opportunity to take corrective action by disciplining the particular prison guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.857" offset="10907156">It's absolutely vital that they have that notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.763" offset="10918859">In addition, just as this Court found in Coit, it's very efficient and useful to have a process that requires claims for money damages to be brought to the attention of the agency before the Federal action is filed so that if they think there is any merit, and if they want to settle the claim, they have the opportunity to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.067" offset="11000047">And I would submit that the 15-day deadline, which we do not view as a statute of limitations in any sense... it is simply a procedure that is readily waivable both by the BOP and in appropriate cases by this Court... serves that function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.919" offset="11063472">The 15-day deadline isn't to erect some sort of barrier for inmates with meritorious claims, it's to protect the interest that the system was established for in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.212" offset="11112583">It allows for very, very speedy relief which helps to reduce tensions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2754.971" offset="11171619">And in the Bureau's experience this system, including that 15-day deadline has been... has worked very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.891" offset="11195339">It has not caused forfeiture of rights as the petitioner would suggest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.810" offset="11858953">And I find it rather surprising that you don't have regulations that would implement the very strong policy arguments you've been making here in that area, which covers most claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.102" offset="11896152">Well, again, Your Honor, most of these claims such as this one, even if they may seek an FTCA remedy, they do bring them under this system as well in order to try and obtain some other kind of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.784" offset="11946934">In addition, Your Honor, I think that the thing that we really do not want to lose sight of here is that we are talking about a system that has been designed by the Bureau of Prisons based upon its experience and expertise and it has found that it has very, very substantial benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.511" offset="12029794">The exhaustion jurisprudence of this Court suggests that it is entirely appropriate, even if full relief cannot be given to the claimant, that exhaustion be required in order to accommodate the benefits and the policies of the agency that is adversely affected when exhaustion is not required, and the petitioner in this case doesn't even contest that those benefits apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.093" offset="12136165">Therefore, we would submit that it is appropriate to defer to the scheme that's been established by the BOP, and if there are problems associated with a meritorious claim where an inmate believes that he has not had an adequate opportunity to present his claim, this Court still would retain equitable jurisdiction to provide relief in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.303" offset="12224981">One last point on the issue of the FTCA remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.004" offset="12243789">One reason why in the Bivens context it's very important that the 15-day deadline and the process that's been established here be exhausted is that the statute of limitations for Bivens is not uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.922" offset="12295407">And in some jurisdictions it would only be 1 year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.076" offset="12308050">And therefore... and under the FTCA procedure they would not necessarily exhaust it by the time that statute of limitations would run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.323" offset="12337099">So by funneling Bivens... potential Bivens actions through the administrative grievance procedure, we help to insure the protection of the litigant's rights to ultimately bring that action, even in the States that have the shortest known statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.989" offset="12399688">If there are no further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.062" offset="12443992">Just a few quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.076" offset="12452037">First of all, on the issue of whether or not there can be extensions of time of the 15-day deadline, Ms. Mahoney referred to it as a mandatory requirement that they get extensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.870" offset="12495192">But it's mandatory only where somebody determines that there's a valid reason for the extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.196" offset="12512537">And the regulations provide no standards whatever for what reasons will be considered valid or invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.537" offset="12533957">So you're left either with two possibilities on this extension of the 15-day deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.864" offset="12551198">Either it's going to be entirely up to the unguided discretion of the Bureau of Prisons to decide when to give an extension, or... and Ms. Mahoney suggests this is what would really happen... you're going to kick this issue over to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.031" offset="12599890">And whenever somebody doesn't get the extension, they're going to be in court saying, well I should have gotten it because I had a valid reason, and this Court's going to have to develop a whole new jurisprudence about which reasons are valid and which ones aren't, exactly similar to the habeas situation, which--</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.463" offset="12657569">All this arises because you have a procedure which was not created with litigation in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.992" offset="12679721">And if you had a situation... procedure that was created as a basis, as a possible prelude to litigation, you wouldn't have a standardless provision like we'll give you an extension when you have a valid reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.098" offset="12720158">You'd have something entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.768" offset="12730816">Also on that point, the suggestion was made that this issue hasn't arisen in the courts, and therefore it must not be creating a lot of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.764" offset="12762790">But the reality is that they only require... the requirement of exhaustion of the grievance procedure only exists in the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.605" offset="12790166">In other places the requirement in damages cases does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.572" offset="12806049">So people have no reason to end up in court fighting about extensions of time on the grievance process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.492" offset="12829768">On the issue of whether people might be satisfied by some relief other than compensation, and therefore there might be some purpose served by people... making people go through the grievance process, obviously that is a possibility, but it's not an interest which can justify requiring everybody to exhaust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.186" offset="12912524">The respondent's brief says that you still have to exhaust this process when you're out of prison altogether when the only interest it could possibly... the only interest that you could possibly have is a compensatory interest, but they still want you to exhaust that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.055" offset="12971979">But the argument for doing so isn't a classic exhaustion argument, it's a kind of help the Government argument, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.069" offset="13004057">They're saying this is the way of making sure that the Government is informed that there is a problem, if indeed there is one, and that independent benefit ought to be sufficient to justify it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.127" offset="13048256">I think the problem with that argument from the Government's point of view is they are making contradictory points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.155" offset="13068423">First they're saying everybody's rushing off to court to bring these Bivens claims, and at the same time, they're saying they're not getting adequate notice of what's going on in the prison in time to fix it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.792" offset="13102904">The third thing that Ms. Mahoney now says, in the Federal Tort Claims Act situation this doesn't arise because 95 percent of the Federal Tort Claims Act claims do get brought to the grievance procedure within that 2-year period before they go to the Tort Claims Act procedure... so they're sort of telling us everybody's going to file a grievance, everybody's rushing off to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.348" offset="13177196">But at the same time, that somehow they just don't know what's going on in these prisons and they don't have enough notice about which guard is beating up on people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.298" offset="13200916">I submit to you that the arguments don't make any sense if you put them right next to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.326" offset="13217112">The final point about this idea that you're going to get Federal Tort Claims Act monetary settlements, first of all, it ignores entirely the issue of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.917" offset="13263401">Nobody in any court that I'm aware of has ever suggested until after cert was granted in this case that the reason we were going to go through this grievance process in Bivens cases is because of a monetary settlement you might get under the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.365" offset="13313242">And every court that's looked at this issue, including the Tenth Circuit, has assumed there's no damages available, that damages is not something that justifies sending people through the grievance process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.924" offset="13351485">And petitioner certainly had no reason to know otherwise.</text>
