            <text syncTime="15.010" offset="204796">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.134" offset="221306">I propose to address historical linkage... configuration title VI and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.468" offset="254638">In 1844, the State chartered the University of Mississippi for white only.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.470" offset="274595">This began a long line of practices minimizing the participation of black people in the system of higher education.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.647" offset="311376">Alcorn State University was established 23 years later, and for 50 years that school was essentially a primary and secondary school.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.919" offset="368427">During this time, from 1840 to 1940, the majority population of State of Mississippi was black.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.652" offset="399356">Thereafter, the State established four other white schools with very broad scopes.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.449" offset="434569">When the State was given what is now Jackson State University, its initial reaction was to downgrade that college to a high school, and when it reappeared again several years later, it, too, had a very narrow educational offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.437" offset="542507">The State freely admits in 1954 that it was spending less money for its black institutions, and in fact was sending its graduates off for graduate school education 16 years after this Court's decision in the Canada case.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.552" offset="638951">It is interesting to note that in the seventies and the eighties, now, when the State claims to have acted positively, the State action reduced black undergraduate enrollment by 14 percent and caused the number of degrees received by blacks to decrease by almost 400 from back... 1990... from that in 1981, according to... Government published report.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.688" offset="795477">Today, the college-going and degree-granting rates for blacks are on a downward trend, and this is due to discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.814" offset="832048">This, Your Honor, is the history Mississippi wants to walk away from.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.139" offset="857335">The historical discrimination to black... hurt black people in five different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.044" offset="884920">Equal access... they were shut out.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.494" offset="898713">It segregated them, and then when they got in they got lesser programs, funding, facilities, reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.191" offset="937583">And it denied black people leadership opportunities and employment opportunities in the five white schools, which were the schools of choice, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.758" offset="983768">But now, if this case is dismissed, I want every... I don't say... if it's dismissed, but yet we show clearly in seven short pages in our reply brief that black people still are experiencing those harms, and the system of... rooted in the days of apartheid in Mississippi still exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.073" offset="1069031">Nothing has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.024" offset="1072897">You have the misuse of the ACT.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.517" offset="1086795">The university center dominated by xxx junior college, in addition to three white schools, still stands in the shadow of Jackson State University.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.101" offset="1125142">You have black people still feeling hostility at the University of Mississippi, and basically the system is substantially intact from 1962 until now; 99 percent of the white students go to white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.093" offset="1189090">Now, the en banc court had an opportunity to deal with the constitutional... I mean, to not have this Court deal with the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.981" offset="1236737">It relegated our title VI claim to a footnote, but to us this claim came first, it's independent, and I think it's dispositive on this record.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.126" offset="1585315">Well, the standard... yes... yes, it is, and I'll tell you the reason why, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.050" offset="1600989">Under title VI you... they... they're basically three aspects that I think that this Court could look at that would help the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.465" offset="1642576">U.S. Exhibit No. 1, for an example, the first exhibit is a plan of compliance, promises versus performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.369" offset="1666295">You can measure what the State basically said it was going to do and what it actually did do.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.964" offset="1692626">But aside from that, you have a lot of interpretative regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.608" offset="1711226">You have the revised criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.299" offset="1717913">Now, it's not law, the regulations, which two co-equal branches of Government expressed their views, but the revised criteria... on the executive branch, but the revised criteria tells you... for an example, it says, when you go into higher education you want... don't want to put the burden of desegregation on the black colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.793" offset="1803908">It talks in terms of how you could do various recruiting mechanism and how you can put together programs to overcome the prior effects of racial discrimination, but yes, I think that regulation section 100-3(b)(6)(i), Your Honor, is very instructive in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.328" offset="1958030">--Well, Your Honor, let me just say it like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.110" offset="1969211">The way I look at it, the... title VI is an independent claim, and even though you may say the standards are the same, they're not coterminous in a sense that under title VI the Government has a lot of regulation that's specific and... not on this regulation we don't have to deal with intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.247" offset="2065759">But for an example, if you look at the Guardian case you... it was similar to the regulation, but it was (b)(2), and of course, impact versus intent standing... the Constitution, more or less, intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.226" offset="2113720">But we're not talking here, now, about impact or intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.187" offset="2125528">I guess what I'm saying is that when you start looking at title VI in this area, for example, there are some implications in terms of Governors and advisory committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.304" offset="2165965">Now, again, back in the old days... I'm sorry about that, but back in the earlier days, under desegregation law they used to have advisory biracial committees, but in higher education I'm not sure that would work that way, but they do give examples of how you can pull the community in.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.986" offset="2244750">So I guess to my mind it's a good possibility if the Court decides the title VI you wouldn't bog the Court down in a lot of stuff.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.584" offset="2283098">And you've got the Department of Education there that may want to get involved, and... the Louisiana case, which was different, but they went out and got a master, and--</text>
            <text syncTime="545.189" offset="2325521">So I'm just saying I think that it would help lower courts, and I think that if people look at the constitutional standard the results under the Constitution may... in the long run I think the results are the same, and that is to eliminate the vestiges of State-imposed segregation, but I think that the means may be a little different.</text>

            <text syncTime="3209.425" offset="12982435">In a nutshell, the duty is met if choice is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.071" offset="13017021">The duty is directly tied to the degree of choice individuals enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.007" offset="13052757">I think when you read carefully what the United States says, when all is said and done the United States acknowledges that the duty to disestablish is met when in fact prior discrimination ceases and nondiscriminatory policies are in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.567" offset="13119003">If racial identifiability is an unlawful effect or vestige or remnant, then the schools themselves are the effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.703" offset="13163621">If you are convinced... and I don't think you are... that the predominantly white institutions must lose their racial identity to be legal, then the same is true, as well, for the predominantly black institutions maintained by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.963" offset="13220568">What I did not get to cover, but it's very crucial, and I don't want to sit down without being sure that we all understand it's very crucial: that the crux of this case is not about choice at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.326" offset="13286083">It's not about the careful definition of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.437" offset="13306563">The crux of this case is a belief by the petitioners that predominantly black institutions are entitled to be enhanced at the hands of the State... not about choice at all, not about duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.859" offset="13376153">That's the crux of this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.481" offset="13382736">And the fact is that the black college in this country will be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.786" offset="13407918">It will be preserved by alumni, friends, legislators, private support... it will be preserved because it ought to be preserved, but it cannot be preserved by judicial decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.455" offset="13466537">With all deference, what to do now that freedom of choice is a fact, what to do now about further enhancing black... predominantly black institutions, if the State can afford it and if it makes educational sense, is up to the... candidly, is up to the executive branch of Government, and the legislative branch of Government, and is none of your--</text>

            <label>Mr. Alvin O. Chambliss, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3386.331" offset="13690040">Your Honor, the facilities talk about as the grand jury condemned, Mississippi Valley State has two buildings... and it's in my record... that just stand... look so good from the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.240" offset="13737688">When Brown talked about stigmatization, he... they talked about... if you're going to get an education, you're in a room with showers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.144" offset="13769348">I mean, you've got shower... hot... you don't have air conditioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.136" offset="13781260">But we're not getting into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.568" offset="13787007">Somebody here... and I think you want to know some facts about, what fetters choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.020" offset="13808845">Our definition of fetters is a factor which prevents choice or promote racial choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.016" offset="13848865">Now, what is the fetter here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.477" offset="13858687">(1) We've got the ACT.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.530" offset="13866837">Those are finding, intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.472" offset="13878644">We've got Underwood here, Hunter v. Underwood that say even though it... well, I don't have to tell you about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.175" offset="13905498">We have the staff makeup, and the programs' disparities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.298" offset="13922008">Now, when you talk about staff makeup, he talks about 30 percent of the black students, but he don't want to talk about the 98 percent white faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.934" offset="13964535">He don't want to talk about the 1 percent black administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.138" offset="13981358">He don't want to talk about apartheid, because you... in higher education, if you can't vote you just don't... and you've got to be tenured, and you've got to be full professor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.523" offset="14014899">Staff makeup, the racial hostility at the University of Mississippi... and I don't want to dump... because I love Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.818" offset="14048022">I'm from Mississippi, and I graduated from the school there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.560" offset="14058994">But the fact is that there's a problem at the University of Mississippi, and it's a racial problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.325" offset="14086057">And I had to give to you all... and I'll brief the facts, but the judge basically was laboring under a misapplication of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.561" offset="14130987">And he found facts based on the standard that was sold to him by our opponent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.606" offset="14155229">And that was basically the standard is you... you do not... you implement... well, you declare on paper open admission policies and you make... you know, you make a good faith effort to come up with something that is race neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.341" offset="14234119">Now what that does, as I see it, is not... we're not talking about race neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.193" offset="14253554">What you're talking about under Brown and the cases that this Court has dealt with, we... we've talked about the "make whole".</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.876" offset="14284274">What is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.008" offset="14288767">Louisiana v. United States, where the Court has a right and obligation, a duty to eradicate.</text>
