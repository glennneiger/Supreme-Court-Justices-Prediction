            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text syncTime="52.698" offset="351083">Mr. Chief Justice, and my it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.337" offset="369578">This case concerns the application of the Veteran's Reemployment Rights Act, which provides job protection for members of the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.161" offset="404895">The question at issue which arise under Section 2024(d) of the act, is whether the right to a leave of absence upon request to perform active duty for training is conditioned on the reasonableness of the request, or more specifically, on the length of the leave requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.045" offset="480441">In 1987, petitioner, Mr. William King, who was employed as head of security at respondent hospital, requested a leave of absence to serve a 3-year tour of full-time duty in the Alabama National Guard, as a member of the Active Guard Reserve program, which provides full-time support personnel for armed forces Reserve units.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.066" offset="572497">This request was denied by the hospital, which filed this action for a declaratory judgment that they were not required to grant the leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.281" offset="613352">The courts below held that a request for leave under Section 2024(d) is subject to a three-factor test of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.091" offset="648670">In applying that test, the court of appeals focused on the length of a leave, and ruled that a 3-year leave was, per se, unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.961" offset="684092">In any event, they held, petitioner's request was unreasonable under the circumstances, mainly because it was too long.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.552" offset="718469">The Government petitioned for certiorari to resolve a circuit split on the issue of the interpretation of Section 2024(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="153.610" offset="754727">It is our position that the Eleventh Circuit's reasonableness test has no basis whatsoever in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.169" offset="784925">There simply is not requirement that a request for leave be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.856" offset="807703">Once it is established, and no one contests in this case, that Section 2024(d) covers petitioner's duty, and that if he enjoys any re-employment rights at all, it is under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.958" offset="872069">The Government submits that the language of &lt;twenty twenty-four d@l&gt; [= 2024(d)] answers this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.675" offset="887011">Now on the question of coverage, the district court made the finding that petitioner received orders under Section 502 of 32 U.S.C. to perform full-time National Guard duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.248" offset="941241">And Section 2024(f) of the Reemployment Rights provision states that full-time National Guard duty under Section 502 is considered active duty for training for purposes of 2024(d), the provision at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.162" offset="1012921">That provision states in pertinent part that an employee shall, upon request, be granted a leave of absence by such person's employer for the period required to perform active duty for training.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.985" offset="1072167">The provision says that the employee shall be granted leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.781" offset="1087423">There is no option for the employer to refuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.419" offset="1101947">The only condition placed on the grant of leave is that of a request, a condition that was complied with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.511" offset="1130368">It's obvious, it's plain, that the word "reasonable" no where appears in this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.866" offset="1155759">And as for the factor of which the court made so much, that of the duration of leave, the provision obviously places no fixed limitation on how long an individual can be away from their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.347" offset="1205705">And to the extent that it can be said to address duration at all, it states that the employee is to be granted a leave for the period required to perform the pertinent duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.576" offset="1250531">That language makes clear that the period of the leave is just the period required to complete the training program in which the reservist is enrolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.775" offset="1291387">That requirement, it is assumed, will be fixed by statute or by the military, whose job it is, after all, to determine these sorts of requirements, and which is traditionally accorded a great deal of deference in fixing training requirements in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.361" offset="1365679">Now in this case, Army regulations require 3 years of service in the AGR program.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.687" offset="1395040">And it follows that petitioner retains his leave of absence status and his right to return to his position for the full 3 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.605" offset="1430671">To summarize then, Section 2024(d) creates a flexible, elastic protection that expands and contracts to fit the requirements of a particular tour of training duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.195" offset="1629098">In order to be away 12 years, he'd have to re-enroll four times.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.269" offset="1649369">We are... the Government is aware of no cases in which someone has sought to return to his job after re-enrolling in AGR four times.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.172" offset="1685000">What generally happens as a practical matter, Your Honor, in the very rare cases in which people re-enroll in AGR, is that the individuals choose to give up their jobs and make a career of this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.917" offset="1739961">So the theoretical possibility, which we concede exists, because it is possible to re-enroll in the AGR, although it's totally at the discretion of the military... an individual can't do it on their own motion... that theoretical possibility hasn't really been a problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.109" offset="2008709">And the reason that it's more tenable than perhaps the alternative, is because 2024(d), and also other sections contain what this Court has called the escalator clause, which says that he shall... an individual shall return with such status and such seniority as he would have had had he remained on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.742" offset="2091256">Now, it's truism that if someone's position is abolished, they would not have had such a job even if they had stayed on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.377" offset="2137754">And we think that this section manifests Congress' intent not to make returning trainees better off than they would have been if they'd stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.310" offset="2181535">So the combination of those two sections, we think, answers that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1761.199" offset="7185029">And they are stabilized, which basically means they can't be moved during the first period, but they can during the subsequent periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.913" offset="7227974">I will move on quickly to say that it says that there are provisions for retention up to 20 years, and it specifies the program... the pension program that would be eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.139" offset="7296833">Now I submit, Your Honor, and I take issue with the Government, and I think the Government misconceives my argument and misunderstands it when I say that a leave of absence of 3 years is unheard of.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.116" offset="7836732">What I'm trying to say is that in 1960, when this law was passed, someone... able, I suppose, legislator... sat down and they wrote out provisions for the sections that were involved and very carefully gave the inductees unlimited rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.230" offset="7945192">And I hope no one claims that they should not be given virtually unlimited rights in terms of duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.462" offset="7970165">They gave volunteer persons a 4-year limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.914" offset="7987929">And they worked down the statute with what they had to work with until they got to the bottom of the statute, and in accordance with the Universal Military Training Act that gives birth to 2024(d), it provided initial duty... initial period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.764" offset="8075282">And that's when a person went off, a civilian for the first time, and went off and took a 3 to 6-month training program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.213" offset="8109137">No question but what Sky King did that long before this event occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.648" offset="8138916">Once a civilian went off and took that initial training period, that person had a Reserve obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.738" offset="8183220">And Justice Souter, I'll answer your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.690" offset="8198998">If you stay in the Reserves, you must satisfy the Reserve obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.343" offset="8225643">And usually the Reserve obligation is to go to drills, weekend drills once a month, and also summer camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.040" offset="8276425">And I would submit that those are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.836" offset="8287605">But I also agree with the Government that the voluntary nature of these programs in the cases that have been decided, have said that that's not a proper point to distinguish these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.784" offset="8351449">If someone interpreted leave of absence and return in terms of the Perpich case, I pulled a quotation from that, that the Court decided in 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.555" offset="8438489">It doesn't have any bearing on this case except the hat analogy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2179.060" offset="8856552">And I'll answer that question in terms of the reference to 502, 503, 504, and 505, those are National Guard Authorization statutes that define training of short duration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2225.104" offset="9040663">You look at 2024(d), it talks about these unusual programs... they call them active duty for training.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.545" offset="9462489">And then in 1980, they simply moved 502(f) from... they didn't move it from inactive, they moved it to active duty, but left it in inactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.334" offset="9541587">Did not tell us anything about durational limitations or frequency, but simply a recognition, in my humble opinion, that there was some active duty for training or other duties under 502(f).</text>
