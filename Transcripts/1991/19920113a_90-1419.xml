            <text syncTime="68.818" offset="424371">This case is here from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.292" offset="442239">That court overturned the Interstate Commerce Commission's construction of a statute entrusted to the Commission to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.096" offset="473481">Congress acted promptly to overturn the court of appeals' decision, amending the statute while the case was still pending on rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.612" offset="507545">The court of appeals nonetheless stuck to its guns and denied rehearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="100.842" offset="552476">--Yes, Your Honor, it was made explicitly applicable to any case pending before, during, or after enactment of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.215" offset="577971">Twenty years ago Amtrak inaugurated its Montrealer service between Washington's Union Station and Montreal.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.852" offset="608482">The train traveled through Vermont and New Hampshire over the Connecticut River Line, a line owned over some portions by the Boston and Maine and over other portions by the Central Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.867" offset="648606">Things ran smoothly until the mid-1980's, when Guilford Transportation acquired both Boston and Maine and the Delaware and Hudson Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.244" offset="686118">Now, the Delaware and Hudson owned a north-south line of track parallel to the Conn River Line west of Lake Champlain in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.680" offset="719764">As a result, the Conn River Line diminished in importance to Boston and Maine and to its parent Guilford, to the point that in 1987 Boston and Maine listed its portion of the Conn River Line as track it anticipated abandoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.179" offset="777860">Conditions on the line deteriorated, the Montrealer slowed to a crawl over the Boston and Maine segment, and in 1987 Amtrak cancelled Montrealer service.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.427" offset="818820">To restore that service, Amtrak determined that it needed to rehabilitate the Conn River Line, and Congress appropriated money for the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.894" offset="856645">Amtrak was unable to agree with Boston and Maine on terms under which it felt it could responsibly invest the necessary funds, and it turned to the Interstate Commerce Commission for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.081" offset="905442">It sought two things from the Commission: first, an order authorizing it to condemn the Boston and Maine segment for just compensation, and second an order authorizing it to then reconvey the line to the Central Vermont, which had agreed to pay for the line, to rehabilitate it in part with funds provided by Amtrak, to maintain it in a condition suitable for Amtrak's passenger service for 20 years, to grant Amtrak trackage rights for that period, and also to grant the Boston and Maine trackage rights so that it could serve its existing customers on the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.706" offset="1043891">Both steps in this transaction... the condemnation and the reconveyance... required ICC approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.170" offset="1069805">Amtrak sought approval for the condemnation under section 402(d) of the Rail Passenger Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.874" offset="1100629">That statute specifies that if Amtrak and the railroad are unable to agree on the sale of property owned by the railroad and required for inter-city rail passenger service, that Amtrak may seek an order establishing its need for the property and requiring its conveyance on reasonable terms and conditions, including just compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.036" offset="1181191">Mr. Roberts, does the ICC have to make a determination as to whether the property is required for inner-city rail passenger service?</text>
            <text syncTime="269.286" offset="1226226">They have to look at that question and decide it?</text>

            <text syncTime="272.986" offset="1241063">Of course, there's quite a dispute over what that passage means.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.709" offset="1255901">The court of appeals determined that required for inter-city rail passenger service meant basically that Amtrak could not get by with anything else, and what it reasoned was that since Amtrak didn't retain the fee interest in the Boston and Maine Line, that it didn't require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.562" offset="1323297">Since it didn't require it, it couldn't condemn it in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.173" offset="1401769">The ICC reads that language... required for inter-city rail passenger service... to mean simply that the property that's involved must be put to use by Amtrak in providing that service, as opposed to being used for something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.323" offset="1454432">The language doesn't necessarily have to mean indispensable, as the court of appeals read it, as the Boston and Maine reads it.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.487" offset="1523081">Amtrak decides in the first instance whether it will put this property to use in providing inter-city rail passenger service, and if that is in fact what the property is to be used for, that statutory mandate is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.777" offset="1580237">The Commission looks to make sure that it's being used for inter-city rail passenger service, and then that is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.031" offset="1605210">Nothing in the statute suggests that the ICC is to engage in a process of tearing down the property interest to the least restrictive alternative, and in fact the amendment, of course, makes clear that that is not the case.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="378.062" stopTime="390.170">

            <text syncTime="378.062" offset="1661321">Is there any contention that the review that is required of the FCC was not undertaken in this case, as you define it?</text>

            <text syncTime="392.383" offset="1718582">It is true that there is not a precise finding that this requirement was met, but there's certainly a precise finding in the opinion of the Commission that the Boston and Maine interpretation of the provision is not the correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.955" offset="1784933">There is also certainly findings that the reason Amtrak is proceeding is to restore the Montrealer service to put this line of track to use in providing inter-city rail passenger service, and that is a sufficient finding on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.415" offset="1838745">What the amendment said in 1990 was that Amtrak may reconvey property it has condemned to a third party if the Commission finds that the reconveyance furthers the purposes of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.055" offset="1889318">Now, the amendment simply makes no sense unless it is read to authorize precisely what Amtrak did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.928" offset="1912828">The reasoning of the court of appeals was that Amtrak... if Amtrak intended to reconvey property, it couldn't condemn it.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.700" offset="1939891">The amendment says Amtrak can reconvey property it has condemned, so it simply cannot be the case that the reconveyance dooms the condemnation in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.389" offset="1982627">In our opening brief we challenge the respondent to come up with an explanation of what the amendment means, if not that this type of a transaction is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.465" offset="2018990">It came up with no explanation in its brief, and it will not be able to come up with an explanation here this afternoon.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.506" offset="2223163">The language of the amendment makes clear that it is not an answer to the Commission's order to say that you reconveyed that, therefore the condemnation was no good in the beginning, because the amendment makes clear that Amtrak may reconvey property it has condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.526" offset="2283245">If it may reconvey property it has condemned, it simply cannot be the case that the reconveyance dooms the condemnation in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.604" offset="6771499">Yes, Chief Justice, that is our answer, and let me amplify, if I may, on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.928" offset="6788845">When Congress enacted this particular section in 1973 they also enacted a similar provision, section 305(d) of the Rail Passenger Service Act, which provides Amtrak with the authority to condemn nonrailroad-owned property... that is, property that might be owned by any other private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.642" offset="6867630">And that statutory provision has a similar language in it, which says that the property, again, must be required for inter-city rail passenger service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.178" offset="6909844">Now, the reason why the requirement for inter-city rail passenger service has to be met in the first instance is that the second level of determination of need applies only if it will substantially impair the obligations of the... of the railroad to function as a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.683" offset="7003780">Now, let us assume as a hypothetical that Conrail owes... owns a building over here on Pennsylvania Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.910" offset="7040769">That building could conceivably be taken by Amtrak for whatever purposes if it can be shown that the taking of the building doesn't impair Conrail's ability to act as a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.779" offset="7092178">If you don't go through the first level of limitation that is required for inter-city rail passenger service, you never get to the consideration of why they're taking the property in the first instance, and this is consistent with the nature of this very type of statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2618.981" offset="10624978">--Well, I think it would be a very hard case to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.304" offset="10646294">I'm not saying that it couldn't be made under any circumstance, but it would be a hard case to make, particularly since the Commission has the authority to impose these requirements on freight railroads, to allow Amtrak to use their tracks and to provide services and facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.945" offset="10708884">And so armed with the authority of the Commission Amtrak can clearly go to a railroad and say this is what we want and this is what we need when it comes to providing services for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.122" offset="10769592">And since Congress has set out a very particularized scheme under which Amtrak is entitled to get those services, facilities, and use of tracks, we don't think that the use of a condemnation power, which traditionally has been construed by the courts, particularly in the hands of a private party, as being limited, restricted, narrowly construed, to give Amtrak the right to use it to the extent that they've seen fit to use it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.595" offset="10899473">The statutory scheme is such that Congress very clearly imposed limitations on the authority of Amtrak to obtain property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.812" offset="10940329">Now, the Government makes a further argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.904" offset="10960704">They say that Chevron controls the determination of the Commission, but for a number of reasons Chevron is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.112" offset="11001560">To begin with, the statute is not really ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.435" offset="11014830">Chevron applies where you have to grope and figure out what the statute really means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.087" offset="11033429">The statute has plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.920" offset="11040743">It's to be construed by the Commission under some circumstances by a whole host of Federal district judges, under other... where the property is being sought to be taken from private parties that are not railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.259" offset="11094138">Certainly the Chevron decision wouldn't apply to the rulings of 600 or so Federal district judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.614" offset="11119529">But there are limitations in this statute, and we don't believe that the Chevron case applies where there are limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.739" offset="11152025">In this particular setting, the Commission has construed away the limitations that are in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.766" offset="11184208">It never really applied them, and therefore we can't see how Chevron would be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.440" offset="11206882">And thirdly we don't believe it's a permissible construction of the statute because, as I've indicated, there are circumstances where, using the Commission's construction, Amtrak could take an office building, a property of... that is owned by another railroad, without ever showing that that property is required for intercity rail passenger service, and the only mean... the only restriction would be whether the taking of that property impaired the functions of the condemnee's ability to perform as a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.686" offset="11355885">And finally, we don't think that Chevron applies because there just simply is a nonfinding here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.301" offset="11382321">The Commission did not make a finding, as we read the Government's brief at page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.087" offset="11417429">They concede that the Commission did not and does not need to make a determination of what the lesser interests that are required in the circumstances of Amtrak's petition for the taking in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.865" offset="11476570">So where the Commission does not make a finding we don't see how Chevron can have any application.</text>
