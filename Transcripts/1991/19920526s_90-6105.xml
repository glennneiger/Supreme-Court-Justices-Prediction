            <text syncTime="5.817" offset="114046">The first of the two cases is Evans against United States, No. 90-6105.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.976" offset="138705">This case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.114" offset="159290">As part of an investigation of public corruption in Georgia, and FBI agent posing as a real estate developer had a number of conversations with petitioner, Evans, an elected member of the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.206" offset="211639">The agent sought Evans' assistance in an effort to rezone a track of land and gave him $7,000 in cash which Evans failed to report on his state campaign financing disclosure form or on his federal income tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.087" offset="267123">Evans was convicted in District Court of extortion under the Hobbs Act, a federal statute which prohibits the obtaining of property from another induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.705" offset="329608">The Court of Appeals affirmed explaining that under the Hobbs Act a violation occurs if the public official knew that he was being offered the payment in exchange for a specific requested exercise of his official power.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.878" offset="378300">He need not have demanded or requested the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.362" offset="392198">We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the Circuits over the question whether an affirmative act of inducement by a public official such as a demand is an element of the offense of extortion under color of official right prohibited by the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.291" offset="451966">We agree with the Eleventh Circuit that it is not and, therefore, affirm the judgment of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.723" offset="473700">We base our construction of the statute largely on the fact that Congress has presumed to have adapted the common law definition of extortion which did not require a public official to make a demand or a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.274" offset="523855">Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy have filed separate opinions concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia have joined.</text>
