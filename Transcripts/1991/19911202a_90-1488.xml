            <text syncTime="22.496" offset="244542">Ms. Tchen.</text>

            <label>Ms. Christina M. Tchen</label>
            <text syncTime="24.198" offset="251334">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.733" offset="261469">This case raises the question of whether the Federal Adoption Assistance Act and Child Welfare Act of 1980, specifically the provision commonly referred to as the reasonable efforts clause, creates rights that may be enforceable under 42 USC section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.077" offset="322805">The reasonable efforts clause states that in order to be eligible for Federal foster care reimbursement funds, that States must have a plan approved by the secretary that provides that in each case reasonable efforts will be made to keep or return a child home.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.503" offset="384558">The reasonable efforts clause does not provide any further definition or explanation of reasonable efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.073" offset="406814">In light of that, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals below misapplied this Court's decision in Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association when it held that this clause was sufficiently specific and definite to create an enforceable right.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.648" offset="461149">The State of Illinois maintains that although the Adoption Assistance Act is mandatory and benefits the plaintiffs here, that it is simply too vague and amorphous to create a Federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.772" offset="505662">This Court has stated that in order to create Federal rights upon the States, Congress must speak with a clear voice because of the values and concerns inherent in our system of Government, and that clear voice and clear statement is simply lacking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.866" offset="558011">One of the elements of determining whether a clear statement has been provided by Congress under section 1983 is whether the interest asserted by the plaintiffs is too vague and amorphous such that it is beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.689" offset="613286">What the Seventh Circuit did here was to take this notion of competence of the judiciary in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.493" offset="632512">It never looked at the statute at issue here and simply said, that because courts have proved competent to enforce a reasonableness terms in other statutes that have no relation to the statute at hand here, that therefore, courts are competent to enforce this particular reasonable efforts clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.705" offset="701371">But this reasonable efforts clause stands in stark contrast, for example, to the clause construed by this Court in Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.560" offset="736793">In Wilder this Court held that the Boren amendment to the Medicaid act created a Federal right to reasonable and adequate Medicaid reimbursement rates, but it did so after a lengthy and extensive analysis of the statute at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.468" offset="792382">And what this Court found was that the Boren amendment there set forth a lengthy list of specific factors, specific objective benchmarks defining what meant reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.240" offset="831461">There are no such benchmarks or factors here, and what we are left with is a reasonable efforts clause with no definition supplied by Congress that will subject the States to a substantive right to reasonable efforts that will be defined not by Congress but by individual judges applying their own notions of reasonableness.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.237" offset="911500">Doesn't the Sherman Act do the same thing in spades?</text>
            <text syncTime="195.307" offset="935742">We preempt State laws regularly on the basis of a determination that the courts are supposed to make, that there has been an unreasonable restraint of trade.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.413" offset="980150">But what is missing here, Justice Scalia, is a specific designation that Congress intended to create a Federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.353" offset="1007944">What we are trying to do here is we must... there is no specific designation of a Federal right or Federal intent to create a national standard of child welfare or to Federalize child welfare.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.076" offset="1054860">Well, I may agree with you on that, but not because it is too vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.462" offset="1072414">I mean, what does vagueness have to do with whether the right exists or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="237.484" offset="1104493">What this Court has said in Wilder is to set out a three-part test for when under section 1983 this Court can infer a congressional intent to create a Federal right, and the third element of that test is whether the interest is too vague and amorphous.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.478" offset="1160395">Here we have a statute that we agree is mandatory, benefits plaintiffs, but it is simply too vague, and what this Court has said in Wilder is that there cannot be a Federal right unless there is a specific objective benchmark provided by Congress that measures what is reasonable, and that's what is lacking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.653" offset="1221103">I think it is important to note that the reasonable efforts that we are talking about here--</text>

            <text syncTime="306.809" offset="1381809">I think it would be enforcing a Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.627" offset="1392989">Again, section 1983 does not exist simply to remedy statutory violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.614" offset="1412947">Section 1983 exists to remedy deprivation of Federal rights, and what we have to find here is whether there is a Federal right that exists, not merely a mandatory Federal statute that may be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.636" offset="1457041">I think it is important to note, we can always state the most egregious case where a statute we would all agree has been clearly violated, but that doesn't answer the question of whether there is a Federal right that is created.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.948" offset="1522347">What we need, Justice Stevens, is a benchmark that governs not only the easy case that you have posed, which is where there is simply no efforts at all that are being exerted by the State, but also the harder case, which I submit is this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.822" offset="1573861">But that is what Justice Scalia's question was directed to, is that reasonableness is a standard that is judicially enforceable in other contexts, but you say not in this context.</text>

            <text syncTime="374.967" offset="1654423">--I think that is true, and I think the problems in this case demonstrate the problems with having a reasonable efforts clause that is not defined by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.121" offset="1683053">In this case, what the district court below found was that after the State of Illinois instituted a remedial plan to assign caseworkers more quickly, 83 percent of the time the district court found the State of Illinois was assigning a caseworker within 10 calendar days, less than 2 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.480" offset="1748463">Nonetheless, and we don't know why, the district court found that to be unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.700" offset="1765286">The State further provided specific evidence on why there may be instances in which a delay in assigning a caseworker would be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.604" offset="1792976">For example, the State of Illinois is under another consent to create another Federal case that requires the State to provide a Spanish-speaking caseworker only to Spanish-speaking families and children.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.162" offset="1839160">But a Spanish-speaking caseworker may not be available within the 3 days that the injunction requires or even the 10 days in which 83 percent of the cases were assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.816" offset="1869776">There are other instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.018" offset="1874583">We had testimony in the preliminary injunction action that a 3-day across the board rule such as was imposed by the district court here requires us to assign a caseworker to a case with less risk, the truant teenager case, as quickly as we assign a case to the severely burned infant.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.543" offset="1944695">It is simply... it's an intrusion by the Federal court on that very specific decision making that child welfare administrators are supposed to make and what Congress intended child welfare administrators to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.424" offset="2040199">This is particularly an area where we don't know what works with abused and neglected children, and I think it's important to note that at the time the act was passed in 1980, this whole concept of requiring States to make reasonable efforts to keep abused children in abusive homes was somewhat new to the States, which is why there was a delayed effective date, and which is why the Secretary in promulgating regulations specifically stated that he made the determination it was better to leave the flexibility to the States and to allow States to make their determinations of how they were going to meet the reasonable efforts clause, allow the States to make the policy decisions of how to balance scarce resources and allocate scarce resources in this very difficult area.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.068" offset="2206756">It is, again, I think important to note, reasonable efforts... these are not reasonable efforts to conduct negotiations around a collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.867" offset="2301946">Here we have no marketplace for reasonable efforts, and we have a much more difficult decision than determining what are reasonable rates or reasonable rents, and yet the plaintiffs ask us to find a Federal right in a statute that provides not only less guidance than the Boren amendment or the regulations in Wright, but absolutely no guidance whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.031" offset="10906680">The question is whether or not courts are competent to enforce this reasonableness standard, and courts enforce reasonableness standards on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.487" offset="10944506">It is a central task of Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.955" offset="10954328">And in fact, in the Wilder case, less than a year and a half ago, this Court again affirmed that Federal courts are capable of enforcing reasonableness standards, even though under that statute Federal courts would be required to look at, among other things, what constitutes adequate health care, what constitutes reasonable access to adequate health care, whether or not the State's Medicaid rates adequately account for the particular needs of individual hospitals serving a disproportionately large number of low income patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.893" offset="11078148">In short, a rather complicated inquiry, but one which, under this Court's decision in Wilder, the courts are well-equipped to undertake, and there is no reason to believe that Federal courts are any less capable of enforcing the reasonableness inquiry, a requirement set forth in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.169" offset="11139170">In fact, the State court enforcement or the State court decisions under section 672 (a)(1) provide further evidence that courts generally are capable of assessing whether or not a State has made reasonable efforts to keep a family together, and defendants present no reason to or nothing to distinguish Federal courts' ability to enforce that standard contained in this Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.803" offset="11241779">Instead, they point only to this section as an indication that Congress intended to preclude enforcement under section 1983 of this statute, but that State court determinations under this section occur only at the time the State assumes custody of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.264" offset="11319624">They have no bearing on children who remain in their homes but are at risk of being removed when the State is making no efforts to keep them there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.191" offset="11379288">These determinations under section 672(a)(1) provide no opportunity for... to address the sort of systemic grievances which plaintiffs are seeking to remedy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.582" offset="11424845">In short, this provision pales in comparison to the express cause of action provided by Congress in the statutes at issue in Smith v. Robinson or National Sea Clammers, which this Court found sufficiently comprehensive to preclude enforcement under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.227" offset="11499451">Just because section 1983 is available, however, does not mean that courts will be flooded with challenges to particular casework decisions in individual cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.803" offset="11557756">The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, like the Boren amendment, the provision at issue in Wilder, affords States substantial discretion in how they are to implement their obligations under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.980" offset="11610419">In keeping with Wilder then, plaintiffs will be under a heavy burden to show that the State's conduct fell outside of the range permitted by Congress under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.602" offset="11652947">In fact, in the Winston case which we addressed in our supplemental memorandum, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit showed how this heavy burden and this substantial discretion will prevent the sort of flood of litigation which defendants predict from ever occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.130" offset="11723059">In that case the court first confirmed that the reasonable efforts requirement created enforceable rights under section 1983 but then it went on to hold that Pennsylvania's visitation policies were within the range of conduct permitted by Congress under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.056" offset="11786798">Pennsylvania had in fact exercised appropriate professional judgment, appropriate discretion in setting up those visitation policies, and as a result the court affirmed the judgment of the district court in favor of the State and county defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.315" offset="11843745">Beyond that, beyond this heavy burden and the discretion afforded States, collateral estoppel will also serve to preclude what in all likelihood would otherwise be the bulk of claims under this statute, namely, parents challenging the decision to remove a child from the home in the first instance.</text>
