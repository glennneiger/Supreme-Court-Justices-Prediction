            <text syncTime="60.333" offset="373909">This rule is contrary to the holdings of Neitzke and is contrary to the logic of, the interpretation of 1915 in the line of cases this Court has announced beginning with McDonald and Sindram, passing through the announcement of Rule 38.9 and the recent case of Zatko.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.300" offset="481742">The... it is my contention initially there is no justification for an exclusive judicial notice rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.187" offset="525315">The Ninth Circuit has fashioned this requirement out of thin air.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.819" offset="543914">It has no basis in law and is contrary to policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.237" offset="585501">The Ninth Circuit required that before a case could be determined as frivolous and in forma pauperis status rejected, reference had to be made through judicial notice to some objective negating fact which positively contramanded the allegations of the pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.512" offset="674631">This approach is contrary to that in Neitzke, in which this Court required that, contrary to a 12(b) motion for judgment on the pleadings, a district court had to pierce the veil and eliminate, pierce the veil of the pleadings in the complaint and eliminate the fantastic and the delusional.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.943" offset="800332">Clearly the Ninth Circuit rule fails as to the fantastic.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.547" offset="818826">There is no judicial notice to be made that a plaintiff is not Satan or Mohammed or a martian.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.912" offset="852263">These fantastic cases prove that the exclusive judicial notice rule cannot be left in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.068" offset="888835">The present case presents the other half of Neitzke, the delusional cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.512" offset="918614">Within the corners of these five complaints is ample proof of a diagnosed delusional condition and of perceptions which not only defy the principles of formal logic but also defy common sense, and in fact are perfectly predictable from the initial medical diagnosis in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.500" offset="1026552">This is an individual who is incapable of reasoning in an appropriate manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.826" offset="1063855">We do not say that because he is ill his complaints must be ignored.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.825" offset="1627891">As to whether or not all would survive is a matter that I think is at first instance entrusted to the discretion of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.720" offset="1663522">However, the larger context and the context to which the magistrate referred in dismissing these complaints is that the seemingly rational is in fact tainted by the less rational contained in the grouping.</text>

            <text syncTime="831.506" offset="3458657">Section 1915 is a statute of general applicability to poor persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.782" offset="3487705">It is a statute enacted in support of a congressional goal that access to the courts should be equally available to the poor as well as to the rich.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.175" offset="3525321">It is not a statute which applies only to prisoner or civil rights cases such as this case is, and, as the Chief Justice has indicated, it is not a sanction statement, statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.805" offset="3575790">In balancing the right of access under Section 1915 against caseload concerns that district courts obviously have that moved Congress to authorize dismissals for frivolousness under the statute, it is desirable that district courts be afforded an objective standard... this is one of the substantial differences between the petitioner and the respondent in this case... an objective standard pursuant to which they can determine whether particular factual allegations have an arguable basis and therefore are not frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.202" offset="3729390">This Court has already partially determined an objective standard in Neitzke, namely the standard that the claim must have a, quote, arguable basis, unquote, in law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.953" offset="3796368">Arguable does not mean reasonable chance of succeeding according to the viewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.306" offset="3817788">Arguable in the view of the respondent means whether any rational fact-finder could conclude that the allegations are true.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.740" offset="3903574">Certainly that is the sense in which it is most frequently used, but the Court's definition of the standard in Neitzke applied the same definition, arguable basis, to both law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.962" offset="3972433">And it seems to the respondent that in trying to figure out what an arguable basis is, Mr. Chief Justice, that a rational fact-finder would be the one to determine whether a particular factual argument is or is not arguable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.404" offset="4162186">The Neitzke case clearly establishes that motions to dismiss and frivolousness dismissals are different in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.429" offset="4198340">And if I may respond to Justice Scalia's earlier question, it is the respondent's view, it is my view that a frivolousness dismissal constitutes a factual determination of frivolousness which would preclude the bringing of a second action on the same claims if the plaintiff could get together the money to pay the filing fee.</text>
