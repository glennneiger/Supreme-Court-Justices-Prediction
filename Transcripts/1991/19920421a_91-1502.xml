            <text syncTime="14.431" offset="212998">This case is here from the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.774" offset="230344">That court ruled that the Secretary of Commerce could, consistent with the Constitution and the Census Act, include Federal personnel stationed abroad, primarily servicemen and servicewomen, in the State-by-State apportionment count on which the allocation of representatives is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.415" offset="300979">The court went on, however, to hold that the Secretary's method for doing so with respect to the 1990 census was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.214" offset="352074">The Secretary relied primarily on home of record data in Defense Department files, as had been done in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.619" offset="385720">Home of record is a serviceman's actual home at time of enlistment and it is where the military will return him when he is discharged.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.751" offset="578295">Taxation is treated with a different concept, legal residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.841" offset="594595">Someone can have a home State in one State and declare a legal residence for tax purposes elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.057" offset="615493">But the suggestion that home of record is subject to manipulation for tax purposes is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.961" offset="639108">I would refer the Court to the joint appendix, page 151 where that is clarified.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.785" offset="662409">Now, based on its finding of a violation, the district court ordered the executive branch defendants not to count the nearly 1 million Federal personnel stationed abroad in the apportionment count at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.102" offset="711728">It ordered that a new statement be sent to Congress specifying the number of representatives to which each State is entitled, and it ordered the clerk of the House to send to the governors new certificates telling them how many representatives their States were entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.414" offset="768884">If allowed to stand, the decision below will shift a representative from the State of Washington to Massachusetts, only the second time in the 200-year history of the census that any such relief has been ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.840" offset="818621">The first time was last fall with the district court's decision in the Montana case which this Court reversed last month.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.025" offset="847356">The decision here should meet the same fate: first, because judicial review is unavailable under the APA; second, even if review is available, the Secretary's decision to allocate personnel abroad to their home of record is not arbitrary and capricious; and third, even if there is a violation of the APA, the appropriate remedy is a remand to the Secretary, not judicial reapportionment of the House of Representatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.321" offset="1068561">We recognize that this Court in Webster against Doe indicated that there may be a higher level that needs to be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.707" offset="1098131">But in Webster, the constitutional claim was a personal right, extrinsic if you will, from the matter that Congress had insulated from judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.631" offset="1241805">The Secretary didn't estimate the number of servicepeople abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.604" offset="1257687">It didn't take a sample and then extrapolate from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.807" offset="1270540">The Secretary counted them, 918,810, not 809 and not 811.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.193" offset="1300006">Now, the Secretary counted them from forms, but that is how the census is conducted by and large.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.755" offset="1326337">When you get a census form in the mail, it asks you to fill it out, or the head of the household, and state how many people are living at that home.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.851" offset="1362700">You list yourself, a spouse, three children, the form is returned.</text>

            <text syncTime="953.067" offset="3967526">I was indicating the numerous exceptions to the usual residence rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.389" offset="3984871">Six censuses, from 1870 to 1920, seafarers, not matter how long they were absent, counted at the land home.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.874" offset="4018726">The military in 1900 counted at their family home even if stationed as the instruction said, at home or abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.550" offset="4053416">Members of Congress are counted at their home district, even though they live and sleep most of the time in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.638" offset="4085808">From 1910 to 1940, the instructions said, if there is an American citizen in your family abroad, he should be counted at your family home, and it said, it does not matter how long the absence may continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.564" offset="4137531">In other words, the usual residence concept cannot provide law to apply in considering this case, because this is a departure and modification of the usual residence rule, as has been historically done in a variety of circumstances including, of course, most prominently in 1970 when again, Federal personnel abroad were apportioned among the States based on home of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.371" offset="4232721">Now turning to the merits, the district court concluded that the Secretary's decision to apportion the personnel overseas was not arbitrary and capricious in itself, and it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.569" offset="4301580">The record indicates the reasons for the Secretary's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.192" offset="4312029">These personnel are away from home temporarily and involuntarily in the service of their country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.156" offset="4335852">They still consider themselves usual residents of the United States, although they are overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.252" offset="4360303">The Secretary noted the bipartisan congressional support for apportioning the overseas population, and in turn, that support noted these personnel vote in the United States, they pay taxes in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.899" offset="4410876">Now, the Secretary did note in his decision memorandum that the Defense Department was going to undertake a survey, an actual survey of its personnel overseas, but contrary to the view of Massachusetts, that was not a condition of his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.069" offset="4471584">If the Court would look at the joint appendix on page 122, it spells out exactly what the condition is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.955" offset="4507111">This is the decision memorandum approved by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.208" offset="4528113">It says: I recommend that you count them, provided that there is timely receipt of acceptable data from the Defense Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.334" offset="4560610">Now, when the Defense Department cancelled its survey, that question became pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.136" offset="4583807">Is there acceptable data that can be provided?</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.790" offset="4594464">And the Secretary determined that home of record, supplemented and improved, did provide acceptable data.</text>

            <label>Justice Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="1116.423" offset="4621005">Mr. Roberts, is your argument undercut by the colloquy that Massachusetts sets out on pages 12 and 13 of its brief, which as I read it indicates that counsel for the Government, counsel for your side are saying that the only so-called justification to remove the decision to count based on home of record from the realm of the arbitrary and capricious is the mere fact that Mr. Mossbacher had made a commitment to Congress to count them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.909" offset="4778889">Which seems to say that regardless of the... we are not claiming that it is the substantial accuracy of the home of record data that rescue us; it is simply the principle that we ought to keep our word.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="1170.930" offset="4838971">I don't think that undercuts our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.091" offset="4847643">First of course, representations or statements of counsel are not part of the administrative record, and what needs to be reviewed is the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.367" offset="4876691">But secondly, all that the counsel was saying is that the Secretary had made a commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.920" offset="4898948">He had made a decision, the commitment referred to is simply the decision in the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.293" offset="4920473">Yes, we are going to apportion the overseas personnel if, if there is acceptable data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.317" offset="4944505">So the commitment that the counsel in the trial was referring to is no different than that in the decision memorandum in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.633" offset="4973762">Now, is home of record acceptable data?</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.073" offset="4987555">The Secretary, who has the discretion to conduct the census in the form and content he may determine, determined that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.789" offset="5018380">The technical staff of the Census Bureau said it comes closest to usual residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.221" offset="5036143">It is the last place that a serviceman or woman chooses to reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.866" offset="5054742">The Congressional Research Service, whose study was in the record, indicated that it is closest to a serviceman's own concept of his usual residence, an important point, since much of the census is self-selecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.413" offset="5108972">Now, in the course of reaching that decision, concerns were raised about the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.367" offset="5132691">This is not a sanitized, pre-cooked administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.172" offset="5151918">It is not an administrative record at all in the usual sense of a discrete proceeding leading to a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.205" offset="5172084">It is part of the Census Bureau's business over the past years, but every one of the concerns that Massachusetts raises, every one of the concerns cited by the district court was addressed and answered in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.753" offset="5226314">Let's take them: First, the Department of Defense testified in 1989 that none of its data met a reasonable test of validity for apportionment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.489" offset="5265184">Answer: joint appendix, page 161, the data will be supplemented and improved by methodologies devised by the technical experts who designed the overseas enumeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.369" offset="5316698">Second, there was a gap in home of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.040" offset="5327460">Up to 10 percent of servicemen did not have a home of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.491" offset="5341253">Answer: joint appendix, page 158 and 162, the Defense Manpower Data Center would use its automated records to complete, fill in the gap, to the extent that it will be negligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.269" offset="5392349">It went from 7 percent to 0.2 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.473" offset="5409171">The Census Bureau itself said that the data was of unknown reliability because it could be used to choose a low or no income tax State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.318" offset="5448564">Answer: joint appendix, page 151, it is legal residence that determines where you are taxed, not home of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.464" offset="5477090">The Pentagon opined that last duty station would be closest to the concept of home of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.499" offset="5509273">Answer: joint appendix, page 162, the Census Bureau disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.062" offset="5531529">It noted, for example, if your last duty station was the Pentagon, you would show up as living in D.C., and you may have lived in Virginia or Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.757" offset="5566324">And finally, the point that we hear most frequently, the Census Bureau itself said that it would be, quote, arbitrary, end quote, to rely on the Defense Department data to apportion Federal personnel overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.947" offset="5619091">Answer: joint appendix, page 210, that same study relying on legal opinions in 1949 and 1969 noted that the decision whether to include Federal personnel overseas was discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.178" offset="5680009">So they were obviously not using arbitrary in an APA sense, but simply in the general sense that any categorical determination is arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.551" offset="5717521">Now the question is not... Massachusetts may not agree with these answers, but the question is not whether they were right or wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.576" offset="5745524">The question under this Court's precedence, assuming there is judicial review, is whether the relevant concerns were considered and if the Secretary committed a clear error of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.563" offset="5789514">The record establishes that the concerns were addressed, were considered, and it seems clear that there was not a clear error of judgment in allocating the personnel overseas to their home of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.542" offset="5837475">If there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1466.083" offset="6019601">But the only point I am making is that there is no action against the President under the Administrative Procedure Act, that is the District of Columbia court of appeals, the Federal court of appeals held recently, and as I said, I don't understand Massachusetts to challenge that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1526.403" offset="6260868">The Constitution and the statutes which mirror its language require three things of the apportionment census.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.685" offset="6286050">First, it requires an actual enumeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.348" offset="6300678">That is, the Secretary must actually count the population on a State-by-State basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.714" offset="6330144">The Constitution requires that the census be repeated every 10 years, so the Congress has a current, up-to-date statement of the distribution of the population among the States on which to base apportionment decisions, and finally, as I think the parties agree, the apportionment census must be based solely upon the number of inhabitants living in each State.</text>
