            <text syncTime="21.996" offset="238606">Since 1969, the DeKalb County School System has been subject to a Federal desegregation order formulated principally by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and containing two core features: neighborhood school system attendance zones and the immediate and complete abolition of all racially... of the six racially identifiable schools that existed as of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.731" offset="345499">Beginning almost immediately after the entry of that order, DeKalb County, which borders Atlanta immediately on the east, experienced population shifts described by one expert as one of the most largest and most rapid ever observed anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.006" offset="406626">So that from 1970 through 1986, the percentage of black students served by this school district increased from slightly over 5 percent to almost 50 percent, with a disproportionately high concentration in the southern part of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.702" offset="473395">The district court found, in response to petitioners' request to be relieved of further judicial relief under the 1969 order, that the racial imbalances which had resulted in the schools were "the result of demographic shifts" which could again, quote... which again, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="101.799" offset="557718">"were not caused by any action on the part of the DCSS. "</text>

            <text syncTime="266.999" offset="1218616">But you agree that in the initial period when there is imbalance, even if that imbalance is caused by demographic factors, that the school district had a duty to realign the attendance zones to cause racial balance to the extent practical?</text>

          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="282.192" stopTime="400.769">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="282.192" offset="1279325">Well, that really wasn't this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.192" offset="1287370">Because in this case we were in balance within a short period of time after the entry of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.048" offset="1314747">But the question that you're asking, which is a hypothetical in this case, is a much more difficult one.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.535" offset="1340765">And I think it would depend on what the findings of fact happened to be in that particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.337" offset="1359886">But I think... in the majority of instances, I think the answer would be yes, there probably would be a period of time in which it would continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.859" offset="1394055">But the point is that here, under those circumstances, the order has existed for 22 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.448" offset="1424357">And the district court, consistent with these findings that it made, retained jurisdiction over two issues which are not before the Court today, namely, faculty assignment and allocation of resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.506" offset="1476602">But it held that it would order no further relief in four other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.327" offset="1495932">And one of those areas in which there was to be no further judicial supervision was student assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.397" offset="1520174">The court of appeals did not reject any of the district court's findings as clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.384" offset="1544102">Rather, its reversal was based on two legal prepositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.752" offset="1561552">The first, contrary to the district court, the court of appeals squarely held that the school district is legally responsible for what it referred to as segregation caused by demographic changes, so long as they occur during the pendency of a desegregation decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.814" offset="1629784">And second, the Eleventh Circuit held that a school district cannot attain relief from judicial supervision in one respect without qualifying at the same time in all six of the so-called Green factors, and for a period of at least 3 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.907" offset="1690179">It's important to clarify at the outset that this is not a case like Dowell last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.561" offset="1712853">This is not a case in which we are asking the Court for any present ruling that we have reached the end of our judicial remedial road.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="400.769" offset="1753604">But you are asking that we say that with respect to some of the so-called Green factors, that it apply incrementally some how.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.875" offset="1798117">And I'd like to ask whether you think the Green factors represent distinct constitutional violations or is there a single violation that we're dealing with?</text>

            <text syncTime="429.901" offset="1870215">Yes, it is an important question, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.067" offset="1878887">It's more helpful to me to look at those as kind of guidelines, as indicators among the things that you might look at, but it is a single indicator.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.971" offset="1910443">And that is why I regard that second issue as much more important... much less important, and really following from the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.975" offset="1938446">Because what we are really asking for, the only thing we're asking for from this Court is relief from a new expanded order imposed after we had been operating under the old one for 16 years, an order which said by its terms that it was to be final and terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.419" offset="2012216">With the new expanded features, greatly expanded, aimed exclusively at features... at circumstances over which we have no control and which we did not cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.004" offset="2118587">And during those early years, there's a trend of increasing the number of more than 50 percent black schools: two in '69, two in '73, three in '71, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.627" offset="2161114">My question is in 1969 or '70, would it have been the duty, or would the district judge have had the power to prevent that increased concentration, even if it were attributable entirely to demographic changes?</text>

            <text syncTime="601.422" offset="2556295">And you're telling us in answer to me and to Justice Stevens, that even if you have racially identifiable schools within 1 year after a decree is entered and there has been 1 year of balanced, that that's the end of the Court's concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.532" offset="2620660">But it seems to me that the nature of the violation extends beyond that period.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.037" offset="2646678">That proposition, Justice Kennedy, that it is the stigma that is the controlling factor, has been considered by the Court on several occasions and never commanded a majority of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.845" offset="2697983">If that all by itself, the kind of stigma... the only kind of stigma that you can have in this case, which is that there still is racial imbalance.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.551" offset="2740824">That's just another way of saying that there is racial imbalance.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.586" offset="2752944">That's what the Eleventh Circuit says, that that's what you have to cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.954" offset="2770394">Now, if that is the case, there have been some erroneous decisions that have been entered in the past, including this Court's decision in Pasadena, including Judge Rubin's decision in Houston, and including the decision about 12 years ago in Atlanta itself, in which you had gross racial imbalance but you couldn't trace that to anything... any unconstitutional conduct that the... of which the school board had been guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="709.523" offset="2988673">Fortunately for the Court and for us in this instance, we have factual findings that deal squarely with that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.194" offset="3019393">And actually what is involved here is the basic distinction between de jure and de facto segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.586" offset="3060876">All across the country there are instances in which there are racial imbalances, from Saginaw, Michigan, to Cincinnati, Ohio, Houston, and probably most significant of all for these purposes, Atlanta itself, our next-door neighbor, where it's actually considerably worse than it is in DeKalb County.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.398" offset="3136213">But the consistent approach has been that what you look to, and there have been at least a half-dozen instances in which the Court has said that, is who caused it.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.134" offset="3171113">Was this a result of the constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.752" offset="3185532">You will not have very many cases in which that issue is posed... which a legal issue is posed so cleanly because of the cleanliness of the findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.560" offset="3236837">There is one case that really squarely disposes of both issues, and that's Pasadena.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.129" offset="3259093">The facts on both questions were remarkably similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.633" offset="3281140">In Pasadena, as in this case, you had a Federal court order entered which resulted in a... what the Court called a racially neutral system of student assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.155" offset="3319175">And then you had de facto changes in the demographics that occurred after that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.191" offset="3339341">With regard to the first question presented, the Court said, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="802.011" offset="3358567">"That these shifts were not attributable to any segregative actions on the part of the petitioners. "</text>
            <text syncTime="808.098" offset="3383018">And they did so on findings that were less clear than we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.283" offset="3395661">And with regard to the second question, there was a disagreement in Pasadena over whether the school board's compliance with one portion of the plan dealing with hiring and promoting teachers, but the non-achievement of that particular factor, the Court said, did not, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="835.648" offset="3493150">"require the district to rearrange its attendance zones. "</text>
            <text syncTime="838.248" offset="3503599">In short, what Pasadena held was that relief with respect to student assignment need not await the time that the district is entitled to relief with respect to hiring and promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.806" offset="3561800">And that's this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.441" offset="3568383">I would like to say just a short word about the fundamental principals of federalism and the efficient allocation of educational resources that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.933" offset="3626270">The Court said in Dowell that Federal supervision of local school systems is intended as a temporary measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.003" offset="3650616">And what that recognizes is that, aside from the need to cure constitutional violations, with which we're all in agreement, we're better off if our nation's school systems are run by school boards rather than Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.862" offset="3714042">And to paraphrase Justice Brandeis in the New State Eyes case, school systems are among our Nation's most effective laboratories.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.404" offset="3756151">Yet the safest thing for a school board, subject to a judicial decree to do in response to an innovative idea, is absolutely nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.593" offset="3792931">And that's what this case really comes down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.295" offset="3811739">For 22 years, the school district has complied with the neighborhood attendance zone that was set by HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.532" offset="3840683">In that time there have been no further violations, no hint of recalcitrance, and as the district court said, we have a school board and administration who, and these are the district court's words,</text>
            <text syncTime="933.988" offset="3886554">"are trying to obey the law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="935.840" offset="3893973">The racial imbalances that exist in DeKalb County can no more be traced to a constitutional violation than they can in Chicago or Philadelphia or Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.313" offset="3935873">Yet my clients are now told that they will continue under judicial supervision for who knows how long, and also, that they may be subject to such radical and greatly expanded impositions as drastic gerrymandering of school zones, busing, and that even the neighborhood plan is not inviable.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.327" offset="4023854">Mr. Chief Justice, unless there are questions, I'll save the rest of my time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="974.781" offset="4049663">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="982.237" offset="4079547">In light of what has been said, let me focus on two aspects of the discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.890" offset="4110162">The first is causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.859" offset="4121970">Causation, we believe, is a critical part of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.746" offset="4141509">That is to say, as Mr. Lee indicated, this Court has said quite frequently that a Federal court remedy is excessive if it goes beyond seeking to cure the constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.375" offset="4208069">The 1969 decree that was entered into here was a comprehensive plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.946" offset="4238371">It was agreed to by all the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.063" offset="4250806">As Mr. Lee indicated, this was a plan that was formulated with the guidance of HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.050" offset="4274734">It was a plan formulated with the guidance of this Court, the demand of this Court in Green, that plans be developed to work and to work now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.858" offset="4321963">I think the critical thing about then the way this plan was carried out was that the school board was found by the district court to be acting in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.369" offset="4372014">It sought to achieve the maximum amount of desegregation that was practicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.754" offset="4393539">It instituted voluntarily two programs in the wake of the demographic changes that swept over DeKalb County: the majority to minority transfer program, which this Court identified in Swann as being a very important part of the desegregation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.465" offset="4460412">As soon as Swann came down, the school board voluntarily, with the plaintiffs' approbation, instituted such a plan, as well as a magnet school plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.856" offset="4505970">For 6 years there was silence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.475" offset="4520494">Justice Stevens talked about the developments beginning in early 1970, but the plaintiffs did not come in to court to question the efficacy of the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.947" offset="4570335">What would have been your response to Justice Stevens' concern and mine as to whether or not there is an obligation in the immediate period after the desegregation plan is implemented to demographic changes?</text>

I don't want to quibble about the facts in Pasadena, but the demographic changes in Pasadena began very promptly after the plan went into effect in 1970, so that in 1971 and '72, very early on, there were in fact racially identifiable schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.765" offset="4797601">The key is not whether there is racial identifiability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.383" offset="4812125">The key is what is the action of the school officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.935" offset="4826335">Have they in fact contributed to the creation of racial identifiability through racist assignment policies or other forms of policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.957" offset="4866355">But if there is not causation, then the school board gets to look at the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.575" offset="4888925">The decree is a final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.294" offset="4899792">At page 61 of the joint appendix in this case, this decree, that everyone agreed to, stated by its terms that this is a final and terminal plan of desegregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.120" offset="4951096">But Mr. Starr, if I understand your argument, it really wouldn't have mattered if the plaintiff had objected violently all along the line because they wouldn't have been entitled to any protection from demographic changes not caused by the dual system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1219.765" offset="5029673">At a theoretical level, I have to say that by virtue of the nature of Federal judicial power and the power that the courts enjoy under the equal protection clause, that power must go to remedying a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.691" offset="5093307">We do have to identify a violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.754" offset="6213542">Not a single school in this district has had a majority black faculty since 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.992" offset="6238515">The Fifth Circuit law, as this Court is well aware, imposes a very rigorous requirement, the Singleton requirement, with respect to ratios in each school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.680" offset="6277281">That ratio can be met by the exercise of something that this school board did not want to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.053" offset="6306747">It did not want to engage in the mandatory reassignments of teachers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.259" offset="6467661">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.194" offset="6483335">There are three central and undisputed features to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.597" offset="6500993">First, the DeKalb County School District was intentionally segregated on the basis of race for as long as anyone can remember and up to at least 10 years after the decision in Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.620" offset="6541013">Second, the district court found it's undisputed that the DeKalb School System has never been fully desegregated, that there remain vestiges of segregation even 15 years after the court... after the school district was ordered to cure the problems, and 30 years after Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.547" offset="6600781">And third, the schools in DeKalb County today remain both separate and unequal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.717" offset="6621470">One set of schools are attended by black students, who are disproportionately taught by black teachers who are disproportionately administered by black administrators, and those set of schools have fewer resources than the schools that are attended by white students, have white teachers, white administrators, and have more resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.649" offset="6709137">The district court found in looking at those schools that are disproportionately black versus those schools that are disproportionately white that you consistently find that less money is spent per pupil in black schools, that the teachers in the black schools have less experience than the teachers in the white schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.492" offset="6772562">I'm just wondering how that could be without a finding of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.627" offset="6789072">Is it just that... I suppose, the principal factor is faculty salaries, and there are just teachers who don't want to move to other schools, so that you get more senior teachers in some schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.399" offset="6832122">Is that the principal element?</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher A. Hansen</label>
            <text syncTime="1671.685" offset="6837346">The district court suggested that was one element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.685" offset="6845287">It suggested there may also be something having to do with the age of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.422" offset="6860229">But the district court said you could not explain inequality through just those factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.624" offset="6877052">It said some of the disparity could be explained through those factors but not all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.826" offset="6893875">I think those factors can in part be explained by the fact that there are black schools in DeKalb County and white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.813" offset="6921878">One of the consequences of continuing to have black schools for essentially all of the history of DeKalb County is that sort of inevitably leads school districts toward inequality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.037" offset="6966704">It inevitably leads to black schools at least being perceived as inferior, and in this instance, being treated as inferior by the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.309" offset="6995857">Last term, in Dowell, this Court said that there were two questions to be asked in these kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.297" offset="7019785">First, has the school district engaged in good faith compliance to the prior court orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.832" offset="7037862">The district court found that in at least two instances that the school board has not engaged in good faith compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.836" offset="7061895">They were ordered in 1969 and again in 1976 to desegregate faculty and staff, and they had not done it even as of 1986, despite the repeated orders of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.210" offset="7107452">Today, in those schools that are 80 percent black, the administrators are 60 percent black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.864" offset="7130022">In those schools that are 2 percent black, the administrators are 6 percent black.</text>
