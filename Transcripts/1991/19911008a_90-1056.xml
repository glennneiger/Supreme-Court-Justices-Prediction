            <text syncTime="27.718" offset="240993">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="36.595" offset="276415">This case presents facial challenge to a Tennessee law which prohibits on election day campaigning within 100 feet to the entrance of the polling place.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.583" offset="324376">To put this distance into perspective, this courtroom is almost 100 wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.648" offset="352692">Now, the Tennessee Supreme Court suggested that 25 feet might meet constitutional muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.732" offset="381009">As measured from where I stand, 25 feet goes to the second row of the press section.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.707" offset="408908">It's the State's position that the decision of the Tennessee Supreme Court should be reversed and that the purposes served by this statute are of the highest import, and the limitation imposed on protected speech is minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.108" offset="470557">Each State should be permitted to fashion its election zone boundary in a manner tailored to its election-day conditions as long as that zone reasonably serves the purposes which justify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.389" offset="527608">Laws similar to Tennessee have been outstanding over this country for the past century.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.455" offset="559896">They have effectively served their purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="119.745" offset="609006">The distances run from 25 feet to the maximum... Hawaii has 1,000 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.920" offset="633770">Most of them range between 50 feet and 200 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.973" offset="653936">100 feet is fairly typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.594" offset="664490">I think something like 17 to 18 of the States have 100 feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.269" offset="795102">Well, political campaigns are emotionally charged events.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.262" offset="815164">And I think we have to put it in the proper context.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.775" offset="829166">They may be, for those campaigners and candidates, the most emotionally charged events in our national culture.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.193" offset="862811">On election day, all of this emotion, excitement, and tension is focused right on the polling place.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.228" offset="894994">Campaign workers aren't always cool and reasoned on election day.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.888" offset="913593">Polling places are in all kinds of neighborhoods, the peaceful and the rough.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.222" offset="935014">The entrances to polling places form a natural bottleneck.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.066" offset="954345">Now, if you allow campaigning at those bottlenecks, you're going to get crowds.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.611" offset="980571">Voters and campaign workers alike are going to intermingle.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.474" offset="1000007">The sale pitches are going to go through the crowd and over the crowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.555" offset="1016307">They will not always be softly spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.279" offset="1027174">In many situations they'll be shouting, jostling, and tempers may flair.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.743" offset="1049012">The effect of these conditions will be disorder, disruptive noise, reaching the polling place, delays in voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.496" offset="1080046">These conditions elevate the chances for voter intimidation.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.392" offset="1531651">But what the States are concerned with is this crowding.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.479" offset="1571984">It creates a zone which would... which much reduces the risk to have to apply, Justice O'Connor, those intimidation laws and the interference laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2295.395" offset="9311647">The question was raised about the State's position regarding someone advocating the election of someone that was not on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.692" offset="9348846">And I think Justice O'Connor started with that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.584" offset="9356369">On page 11 of respondent's brief, they set the predicate for that up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.969" offset="9381969">They say the State's witness testified that a person is permitted to distribute handbills within the 100-foot boundary on behalf of a political figure who is not standing for election on that day's ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.307" offset="9431288">However, the record on page 43 of the appendix, the testimony was: Question: Okay, if a person were distributing handbills on behalf of a political figure who was not standing for election on that day, could that person do that inside the 100-foot boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.349" offset="9503491">The unequivocal answer was no, they could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.062" offset="9518328">So we would say the predicate for that position is not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.487" offset="9535987">There was a further discussion, could someone on the ballot just generally hand out literature that said they had a good record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.230" offset="9562945">There was a suggestion, well, if they were on the ballot they couldn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="2364.793" offset="9589277">But it is clear... a reading of the statute... it doesn't distinguish between whether it's on the ballot or not on the ballot if it's campaign activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.319" offset="9623340">The Tennessee Supreme Court has clearly defined campaign activity as that which is outcome determinative advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.365" offset="9651553">It's the position, and clearly the position, of the State that such conduct would be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.039" offset="9674227">One other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.739" offset="9681019">It's not just what goes on outside of the polling place, but also if you've got a crowd, and you've got the noise, and you've got the campaign happen... taking place either right outside of the polling place, which is what respondents advocate, or even within 25 feet, we would suggest that noise is going to reach inside the polling place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.552" offset="9756251">And that noise, in and of itself, is going to distract polling officials.</text>
