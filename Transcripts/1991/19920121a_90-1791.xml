            <text syncTime="52.866" offset="345953">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.253" offset="359537">The issue presented on review in this case is the applicability of section 1292(b) of title 28 to an appeal to the courts of appeals from an order entered by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.977" offset="406452">The district court's order is an interlocutory order, and it was entered while sitting in review of a bankruptcy court order entered in an adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.916" offset="442188">The plain meaning of the words of section 1292(b) apply in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.035" offset="462668">We have an order of the district court in a civil action which has been certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.456" offset="484297">Therefore, there should be found under 1292(b) jurisdiction in the court of appeals to entertain the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.628" offset="513032">In addition, section 1292(b) had been applied to bankruptcy cases prior to 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.699" offset="545319">It had been applied both subsection (b) since 1958, and prior to that, what is now subsection (a) concerning injunctive orders had been applied in the bankruptcy context previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.839" offset="589832">To reach the conclusion--</text>

            <label>Ms. Janet C. Hall</label>
            <text syncTime="121.779" offset="621597">--I believe they're important, Mr. Chief Justice, because they demonstrate that there was an existing scheme, which recognized jurisdiction in the courts of appeals under section 1292 as well as other sections which granted jurisdiction of bankruptcy cases.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="134.937" offset="674260">But the bankruptcy court was tied much more closely to the district court before the enactment of the Bankruptcy Code, wasn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="janet_c_hall" startTime="142.693" stopTime="219.841">
            <label>Ms. Janet C. Hall</label>
            <text syncTime="142.693" offset="705293">That is correct, although, the bankruptcy court is still described in the '84 legislation as a unit of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.030" offset="730684">And because of Marathon, it must rest on the Article 3 power of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.049" offset="746671">Although the system has changed, it is not that great a difference in that the House's view of creating Article 3 independent courts never prevailed in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.456" offset="792333">These cases, pre-1978, teach us that there was recognized jurisdiction and existing jurisdictional scheme under 1292, as well as other sections, and that therefore, to reach the result that the court of appeals below reached would require you to conclude that Congress intended to take away that jurisdictional grant, that discretionary, interlocutory appellate power, and that it intended to treat bankruptcy cases in a manner different than it treats all other civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.689" offset="905287">Now this is a dramatic result to be reached, particularly in the face of no evidence to support such a result or such a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.629" offset="937052">And it makes no sense to conclude that Congress would intend to do that when there was before Congress no particular problem faced by 1292 interlocutory appeals in the bankruptcy context, there was not abuse alleged or pointed to, no problem identified that would be a basis or a reason for making this change.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="219.841" offset="1013852">Ms. Hall, why do you suppose Congress enacted section 158(d) if the courts of appeal already had jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="230.648" offset="1057110">Why did they need it?</text>
            <text syncTime="232.433" offset="1064216">And is it just superfluous in your view?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="janet_c_hall" startTime="236.135" stopTime="396.806">
            <label>Ms. Janet C. Hall</label>
            <text syncTime="236.135" offset="1079053">In part it was needed because of initially the House's desire to create the bankruptcy appellate panels.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.789" offset="1105698">In section 1293, which is the origin of 158(d), the House wrote section 1293 in order to create two additional bases in the courts of appeals that had not previously existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.930" offset="1154286">That is, final decisional review of appeals from bankruptcy panels, which of course were new creations, and also to permit the consensual direct appeal on final orders only directly from the bankruptcy court, which had been a desire of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.825" offset="1217816">When section 158(d) was written in 1984, it took both 1293 as well as other sections... 1482, concerning bankruptcy panels, and 1334, which concerned the district court... appeals up from the bankruptcy court to the district courts... and put them together in 158.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.639" offset="1301094">To answer the second part of your question directly, there is a redundancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.091" offset="1318857">Other than the grant of jurisdiction to the bankruptcy panels, which appears in (d), (d) is repetitive in part of the grant of jurisdiction to the courts of appeals under 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.065" offset="1362743">However, a mere redundancy where there is no conflict between the provisions, in other words, you can apply both 158(d) to a core jurisdiction to the courts of appeals, and you can apply 1291, and achieve this exact same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.408" offset="1420108">There will be jurisdiction on final decisions in the courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.478" offset="1444454">There is further no reason to conclude that Congress would wish to treat bankruptcy appeal different because the purpose served by 1292(b), in particular when it was enacted, the purpose it sought to address is just as pertinent in bankruptcy cases as it is in all other civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.072" offset="1510805">The limited discretionary appeal that was granted to the courts of appeals under 1292(b) was designed to provide a specific benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.693" offset="1545287">That is, when the district court certifies that the issue at hand was a controlling issue of law, as to which there was substantial disagreement as to the correct answer, and a result or a decision immediately might advance the termination of the litigation, the courts of appeals were to entertain such requests to hear these appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.341" offset="1619892">And only if the court of appeals agreed in its discretion to hear it would an appeal be entertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.328" offset="1643821">Two benefits are achieved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.280" offset="1655628">Potentially, there is an advancement of the instant litigation that is the subject of the 1292(b) case, but in addition what you achieve is the addressing at the circuit level, not at a district court level, but at the circuit level, of an important, presumably unsettled issue of law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="396.806" stopTime="466.386">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="396.806" offset="1721770">You also achieve a second interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.610" offset="1736921">You were mentioning earlier that there's no conceivable reason why they would have put this in with the purpose that your opponent asserts.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.216" offset="1775373">But the very plausible reason, as the briefs point out, is it's a terrible thing for a lawyer to have to go through two interlocutory appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.136" offset="1807034">You have to go from the bankruptcy court to the district court, all the way up to the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.142" offset="1835037">That's a lot of trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.209" offset="1839321">I would agree with you it's two steps, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.778" offset="1853636">However, those two steps also find a place in the appeal from a final order of a bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.747" offset="1877460">It is inherent in the nature of the scheme that Congress settled upon, finally in 1984, that its desire to refer bankruptcy matters primarily and principally to the bankruptcy court, and yet keep them attached to a district court, necessarily results in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.209" offset="1939318">Yeah, but Congress might have felt that once is enough to have to go through all of that, and that the usual reasons for allowing interlocutory appeal, when there's only one, are out weighed by the fact that you'd have to do it double if you do it in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.367" offset="1991981">I mean, it's at least a plausible reason.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="janet_c_hall" startTime="466.386" stopTime="689.899">
            <label>Ms. Janet C. Hall</label>
            <text syncTime="466.386" offset="2000026">It is plausible, Your Honor, and it is something Congress could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.521" offset="2016640">It is my position that it did not do so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.539" offset="2028657">In order to reach the conclusion that that is the path Congress chose, you must conclude, as the Second Circuit's reasoning went, that because of this mere redundancy, which is an affirmance of the grant of jurisdiction, that we must conclude that 158(d) is exclusive, in essence, is the stop in interlocutory appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.886" offset="2110054">And that, therefore, if it is exclusive of 1291, it necessarily is exclusive of 1292.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.940" offset="2134296">Well, of course, 158(d) does not say that, unlike, for example, the Expediting Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.278" offset="2155612">It does not say these are the only appeals, it merely makes an affirmative statement of appellate jurisdictional grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.432" offset="2184242">Therefore, you must find an implied appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.568" offset="2200751">And implied repeals are drastic and rare results, as taught by the precedents in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.722" offset="2225411">And I would submit that in this case, the requirements of meeting such a test of implied repeal are woefully lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.043" offset="2254668">First, there is no irreconcilability, as I pointed out before.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.947" offset="2270341">158(d), the part it shares in common with 1291, provides for exactly the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.267" offset="2295628">So they are not irreconcilable.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.719" offset="2305346">Second, the second alternative, which requires that the later enacted statute be comprehensive and be a substitute for the earlier alleged to be repealed statutes, also does not pertain here.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.776" offset="2353620">Clearly, 158(d) is not a comprehensive substitute for 1291 and 1292.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.930" offset="2378279">Otherwise we are left with no general grant of jurisdiction to the courts of appeals from decisions of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.268" offset="2407641">Even if, however, we were to get by one of these two requirements for implied repeals, we are still met with the problem of where is the evidence of Congress' clear and manifest intent to repeal this jurisdictional grant in 1292(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="584.713" offset="2473365">It is not in the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.415" offset="2484128">It is not in the purpose of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.950" offset="2494368">Nor can it be found in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.151" offset="2507115">This is a case where we have in the legislative history two reports, both written before this section was crafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.822" offset="2533760">Neither of those reports support a conclusion of a clear and manifest intent to stop the process of interlocutory appeals short of the court of appeals and to strip them of this discretionary power to hear an interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.065" offset="2590812">Now the Second Circuit found an intent by Congress in this same legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.219" offset="2615367">I would suggest, however, that the second circuit took a course which this Court has counselled against strongly and has disfavored, and that is that the Second Circuit relied upon new, unexplained intermediate steps going back and forth between the House and the Congress, and also upon silence, the absence of words in 158(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="641.632" offset="2701048">Neither of those have been found in the past to support a finding or a demonstration of clear and manifest intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.738" offset="2737515">The trustee here is faced with a difficult problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.774" offset="2749636">If he urges on this Court that you must support his position and find that the redundancy in 158(d) requires the result that 1292 will no longer will apply in bankruptcy cases, and at the bottom of that position is the redundancy, then he must answer the question of what is to be done with the language found in section 305 of the Bankruptcy Code, as enacted by Congress in 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.126" offset="2863008">Section 305 concerns orders of the bankruptcy court to dismiss or suspend a bankruptcy proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="759.659" offset="3173133">The amendment in 1990 that Congress passed was to amend 305, first to make it clear that a denial of such a motion would also not be appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.913" offset="3206152">But in addition, to specifically iterate the sources of court of appeals jurisdiction, which could not be availed in order to take an appeal under 305.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.871" offset="3250038">When they listed those sections, and this is of course an order of the bankruptcy court, clearly, by its own terms 305 says bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.227" offset="3283474">And second, it could clearly be an interlocutory order.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.595" offset="3292879">For example, a denial of a motion to suspend, thus the case continues with the interlocutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.166" offset="3319210">When Congress was specifically addressing the question of the source of jurisdiction in the courts of appeals in bankruptcy cases, it said such appeals in this instance... not this case, I'm sorry... section 305... would not be permitted under 158(d) or 1291 or 1292.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.960" offset="3394338">Thus, when Congress means to restrict the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals in a bankruptcy situation, it says it expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.018" offset="3434567">The language of that amendment is directly contrary to the position the trustee urges on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.422" offset="3464242">What is the Court to do with the Congress' statement, clear recognition, that an appeal under 1292 is to be permitted in bankruptcy matters coming up from the bankruptcy court, except in certain specific instances, 305 being one and 1334(c) being another, and the Remand Statute being the third that was amended in 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.954" offset="3554312">As I've indicated, in conclusion, the plain words of 1292(b) would provide discretionary jurisdiction to the courts of appeals in this case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.881" offset="3610005">158(d) does not require a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.016" offset="3626619">It is not a clear statement by the Congress that it meant to change an existing jurisdictional grant to the courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.337" offset="3655876">The words of the statute do not support such a result, the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code does not support such a result, and the legislative history is silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.858" offset="3689940">Thus, this Court ought to interpret the plain words of the statute, 1292, to find jurisdiction in the Courts of appeals, and to conclude that 158(d) does not plainly express a congressional intent to alter the pre-existing jurisdictional grant to the courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.554" offset="3760784">I would, therefore, ask this Court to reverse the Second Circuit of Appeals, to remand the case to the Second Circuit for consideration of Connecticut National Bank's petition for a leave to appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="951.764" offset="3941551">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="954.549" offset="3952732">I believe, and it's the respondent's position, that his whole case revolves around the fact that if the petitioner's position is accepted, there was no reason for Congress to enact section 158(d) insofar as it applied to district court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.142" offset="4015112">And the first thing I would like to do is address myself to Justice O'Connor's question that was directed to the attorney for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.646" offset="4045101">When Justice O'Connor asked what reason there would be for the passage of this statute, opposing counsel indicated that 158(d) did cover the situation for appeals of the bankruptcy panels created in section 158(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="993.174" offset="4107168">I would suggest that first of all, that is no reason for including district court jurisdiction in section 158(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.011" offset="4138514">And in fact, it raises a situation in which if the petitioner's argument is accepted, a strange situation is created in that 1292, which is relied upon by the petitioner for circuit court jurisdiction of interlocutory appeals for the district court, does not cover such decisions by that bankruptcy panel created in section 158(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.194" offset="4231301">So you have a situation where if the petitioner's argument is accepted, you may have review by the circuit court of appeals for interlocutory orders from the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.482" offset="4268395">But if there is a district in which the bankruptcy panel under 158(b) has been created, 1292 under its plain language would not cover that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.023" offset="4306639">And in fact, that was recognized by the Second Circuit in its decision in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.261" offset="4331612">Namely, that you've got a decision by three judges there, so the need for further review is somewhat less than if you had just one judge passing on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.134" offset="4371004">I mean, presumably you have three people who have decided the issue, and not providing for review from that doesn't seem to me necessarily means they didn't intend to provide the review that preexisted from a normal district court decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.995" offset="4438505">And I don't know whether the fact that's one judge or three judges would be that important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.113" offset="4455014">And secondly, that still doesn't respond to the situation that 158(d) does also include district court jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.839" offset="5529901">You have to accede to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy panel, and when you do, you know that one of the things that goes along with it is that you can't get an interlocutory appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.833" offset="5693845">Another reason that was relied upon a great deal by the petitioner in this case was the fact that the clear language of the statute itself would support its position, that 1292 does provide for interlocutory appeal of district court orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.198" offset="5795305">In fact, I would suggest to the Court that this standard, or this rule of interpretation, doesn't apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.285" offset="5819651">Normally, when that rule of interpretation is applied to a statute, you're talking about considering factors outside of statutory language when interpreting a statute, such as legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.243" offset="5863537">In fact, in this case, what the petitioner is asking you to do is not to ignore legislative history or factors outside of the statutory language, but is actually asking you to ignore other statutes itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.483" offset="5916408">The interpretation that is advanced by the respondent in this case is not based upon, or not relied primarily upon legislative history outside factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.275" offset="5955592">It's relied upon 12... the language of 1292, when that is considered with the plain language of section 158(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.945" offset="5986312">The whole basis of the argument advanced by the respondent is based upon the fact that there was no reason for Congress to pass 158(d) as far as it applied to district court jurisdiction if 1292 is going to apply also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.288" offset="6043677">This is not a situation where you're trying to bring things in outside of the plain language of the statute in order to advance an interpretation, but you're relying upon other statutes that is contained in the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.198" offset="6095295">What the petitioner asks you to do is to take 1292, set it aside by itself, and read it without any relation to any of the other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.852" offset="6125910">And I think the rule of interpretation that is advanced to support that is not relevant to that particular situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1516.931" offset="6202292">305 concerns orders for abstention, and it's clear that Congress did not want those type or orders appealed to the circuit court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.554" offset="6236774">The cases that have considered 158(d) as far as it relates to 1292 have made it clear that 158(d) does not limit appeals to the circuit of appeals in a situation where the district court is acting as the original court of jurisdiction for a bankruptcy matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.499" offset="6312529">In fact, the district court would be entitled, as the original court of jurisdiction, to enter an order under 305.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.570" offset="6336771">So if it was the intent of Congress not to permit these appeals, in order to cover a situation where the district court was acting as the original court of jurisdiction, they would have had to include 1291 and 1292 in there in addition to 158.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.829" offset="6389852">So in fact, including those in there is not inconsistent with the respondent's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.031" offset="6406674">It's simply to cover the situation when the district court is sitting as the original court of jurisdiction for a bankruptcy matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.356" offset="6451919">Another amended basis of the petitioner's arguments in this case is the fact that it would be unreasonable for Congress, or to expect Congress to have wanted to accomplish this by the passage of 158(d) because of the way or because of the result that they would result in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.483" offset="6524434">The fact that there are matters that are important enough that you may want interlocutory review of appellate... of interlocutory orders by the bankruptcy court, you're not going to have that if the respondent's position is accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.958" offset="6574381">I would suggest that when you look at the law concerning what concerns or what involves a final decision in the bankruptcy matter, and also the fact that court of appeals does have the right to obtain jurisdiction over these type of orders by writ of mandamus that any detrimental effect by the adoption of the respondent's position, as far as how this statute is interpreted, is going to be limited.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.871" offset="6850025">If there were policy reasons where Congress would do this, then it would be reasonable for Congress to adopt section 158 and give it the interpretation that's advanced by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.827" offset="6893806">I think the Court would be concerned about an extraordinary situation where that would cause a great injustice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.868" offset="7241966">And there are good reasons for doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.735" offset="7249489">Even though it is recognized by the Court that there are reasons for permitting appeals of interlocutory orders, it was also recognized that there is a cost to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.974" offset="7282403">This cost may be magnified in a situation where you have a bankruptcy estate, where there are important policies for encouraging expeditious administration of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.330" offset="7315840">And in fact, by only permitting review or appellate review of final decisions rather than interlocutory decisions, you have situations where because of many reasons these reviews may not become necessary for the bankruptcy estate, or a situation where if the bankruptcy estate is forced to appeal this issue, at least it can go up to the level and have all of the issues resolved, rather than trying to do it on a piecemeal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.997" offset="7422524">In this case, if there is a final decision in this and there is a subsequent appeal, the bankruptcy estate would have been forced to go up through the appellate process twice, instead of simply having all of the issues presented at one time, with the saving of time and expense to the bankruptcy estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.276" offset="7491592">And again, I don't think that my argument is really necessary... it's necessary to find that these policy reasons are valid, or in fact, stronger than any policy reasons that are advanced by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.535" offset="7548643">Really, the basis of the argument is based upon the fact that there was no reason for 158(d) to be passed if you accept the petitioner's interpretation of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.324" offset="7587827">These policy reasons that I'm presenting to the Court are simply to counter the arguments presented by the petitioner and suggested in other cases or in other court of appeals that have considered this issue, that in fact it may be unreasonable to find the interpretation advanced by the respondent because there is no reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.703" offset="7657313">There are reasons for it, and therefore, I think that even though the basis of it is the structure of 158(d) and the fact that there's no reason to have passed it without... if the petitioner's argument is accepted, these arguments do counter the petitioner's argument and the court of appeal arguments that are presented, that there was no reason for doing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2008.618" offset="8168999">My argument is, is that it supersedes 1292 because it didn't mention interlocutory orders in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.741" offset="8197525">They both... it is relevant because first of all they found it necessary to repeat 1291.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.545" offset="8640666">I mean, the plain language of 1292(b) only applies to district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.849" offset="8657907">Now there was a position raised by this Court that the fact that it's voluntary may be reason why we don't allow appeals to the court of appeals, but the fact is, is that 1292(b) clearly by the plain language of it would not provide for the interlocutory... appeal of an interlocutory order up to the circuit court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.582" offset="8764800">Further support for the respondent's position is also found in the legislative history of section 158's predecessor, section 1293.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.272" offset="8799595">Even though 1293 never became effective during the time that it was enacted, in fact, it is clear from the courts that have considered it that 1293 was basically a predecessor of 158, and that the legislative history, in cases interpreting that, can be applied to 158.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.584" offset="8872843">The legislative history was specifically set out in detail in the Second Circuit Court of opinion, which noted that in fact the version of that statute immediately prior to its passage did not have any provision as it was contained in section 158(d), which provided for the appeal to the circuit court of appeals of only final judgments, orders, or decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.265" offset="8971586">And in fact, that was added later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.901" offset="8982139">I would suggest to the Court that though this is no where near as important as the original argument for my interpretation, the fact that there was no reason to pass 158(d) if you provide for appellate coverage under 1292, it adds further support to the respondent's position.</text>

            <label>Ms. Janet C. Hall</label>
            <text syncTime="2251.878" offset="9142008">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.711" offset="9149323">First, in response to some questions about the bankruptcy appellate panels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.763" offset="9161548">In addition to them being consensual courses of appeal for the litigants, there's another important aspect of the bankruptcy appellate panels, which the district court decision does not give us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.888" offset="9202090">And that is they are constituted or meant to be constituted on a circuit-wide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.756" offset="9217554">They are created by the circuit, and presumably their decisions have precedential value on a circuit-wide basis, which is, as I pointed out in my argument, a benefit of the 1292(b) appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.163" offset="9271158">That in the very limited circumstance of a very important question, the benefit to be achieved from 1292(b) is not only to advance the litigation that's before the court of appeals, but also to attempt to settle an unsettled question of law which will have precedential value on a circuit-wide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.025" offset="9338658">The bankruptcy panels do satisfy that purpose, and thus the fact that the appeal stops with the bankruptcy appellate panel at the interlocutory level is at least understandable and distinct from the suggestion that it should stop at the district court level, which not only doesn't offer a panel or appellate review, but is of little precedential value... in fact none, I would suggest... beyond the case before the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.474" offset="9428415">The standard by which a court of appeals decides to accept submission under 1292(b), it's whether the issue would be dispositive in the particular case, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.798" offset="9481705">A controlling question of law?</text>

            <label>Ms. Janet C. Hall</label>
            <text syncTime="2338.484" offset="9488497">That is the standard by which the district court must first certify the appeal to even be considered by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.721" offset="9513365">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.340" offset="9519843">The court of appeals then has, in the words of the statue, discretion to take the appeal, presumably if it does not think it's a controlling issue of law which will advance the litigation, it will not exercise that discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2356.861" offset="9561953">But there's nothing indicating that a court of appeals must look for something of general importance in that question is there, beyond the particular case?</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.859" offset="9637917">In other words, the words, I believe are, that there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2388.833" offset="9689848">Second, to pick up on a point made by my opponent in response to a question, Justice, about section 305.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.022" offset="9722658">He... his response concerned the abstention orders which are district court orders, and therefore, it does make sense that the amendment in 1990 to the abstention section, which is 1334(c), would include 1291 and 1292.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.448" offset="9784307">Most courts have felt that 1291 and 2 are still in place for district-court originated bankruptcy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.269" offset="9807608">However, that does not address the section 305, which is the dismissal or suspension orders, which are clearly orders that can be entered by a bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.475" offset="9848464">When a case has been referred to it, certainly in the first instance, a motion to dismiss that case would be decided by the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.063" offset="9878766">And that would be under 305.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.515" offset="9888588">And Congress, in 305, just as in 1334, amended in 1990 to add the words: appeals to the courts of appeals under 158(d), 1291, 1292.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.740" offset="9937489">It's a clear expression that when Congress addressed the issue of appellate review in a bankruptcy case originating in the bankruptcy court, it thought that an appeal would lie under 1292, and therefore, when it wished to bar appeals, it needed to list 1292.</text>

            <text syncTime="2489.632" offset="10093074">I mean, all you need is some case to explain the reference to 1291 or 1292.</text>

            <text syncTime="2496.652" offset="10121078">305 would... could be a district court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.090" offset="10138841">The issue... the respondent's position rests primarily on the redundancy, the appearance of the words: and district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.696" offset="10173323">Those first appeared in section 1293.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.981" offset="10190459">And although they were not explained when they appeared, if you look at the structure of 1293 when enacted and when drafted, which is set forth at page 24 and 25 of my brief, you will see that the district court reference gets inserted by the Senate in subpart (b) of 1293.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.561" offset="10264751">Subpart (a) addresses decisions of the bankruptcy appellate panels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.846" offset="10281888">Decisions is the words found in 1291 of title 28, and are usually meant to refer to final decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.052" offset="10314697">When the word district court was entered in (b), it could be argued that they added it because the phrases final judgment, order, and decree did not appear in title 28 anywhere in referring to district court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.211" offset="10375406">Now it's also unnecessary because rule 54 makes the word judgment encompass all decisions, orders, and decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.365" offset="10403932">But that could explain a need to... or a perceived need to insert the words district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.769" offset="10425561">It is clearly, as it appears in 158, a redundancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.590" offset="10440921">However, it is an unexplained redundancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.023" offset="10450639">It is not addressed by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.308" offset="10459729">It does not explicitly state it's meant to repeal anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.760" offset="10473522">And such unexplained reconcilable redundancies, not irreconcilable... we don't have a different result under 1291 and 158(d)... do not support a finding of a congressional intent to repeal a preexisting jurisdictional grant to the courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.638" offset="10541022">If this is not a repeal pro tanto of 1291 and 1292, then that jurisdictional grant found in those two sections is still in effect and still applicable, and that the appeal below should be entertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.898" offset="10598074">There has been no showing that Congress meant to repeal that jurisdictional grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.452" offset="10620330">Certainly 158 and its mere affirmance of existing jurisdiction does not supply that intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.123" offset="10651050">If there are no further questions, thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
