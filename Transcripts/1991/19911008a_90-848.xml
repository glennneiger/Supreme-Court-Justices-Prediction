            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="142235">We'll hear argument now in No. 90-848, Kenneth Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.439" offset="187897">Mr. Beckham.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_j_beckham" startTime="63.622" stopTime="362.908">
            <label>Mr. Robert J. Beckham</label>
            <text syncTime="63.622" offset="396668">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="69.275" offset="419237">This case presents another opportunity for the court to rule upon the question of the Eleventh Amendment or the... that is the presence or the absence of the real Eleventh Amendment, or the presence or the absence of the judicial gloss Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.539" offset="500322">We submit, first of all, that the case below is clearly in conflict with the decisions of this court in the Parden case, in the Petty case before that, and indeed, in the Welch case, where five members of this Court reaffirmed the validity of the existence and the viability of the existence of the cause of action under the FELA or the Jones Act against State-owned entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.708" offset="613066">In addition to those specific authorities, dealing with the FELA-Jones Act, we have cited three other cases, the United States v. California, California v. Taylor, and the United Transportation Union case, all consistently holding that the pervasive effect of the preemptive power of Congress in dealing with this Nation's railroads, mandate that there is a uniform system that applies to each and every railroad in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.810" offset="733438">We still believe that this Court's decision recently in the Port Authority case between... dealing with the entity between New York and New Jersey, implicitly reaffirms the existence of this cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.522" offset="808253">In the PATH case, the Court determined that there was expressed statutory waiver of immunity from Federal court jurisdiction, the classic Eleventh Amendment bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.663" offset="860811">The Court held that that jurisdiction had been waived... the bar had been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.215" offset="883068">And it would be, it seems to us, entirely fruitless for this Court to have decided that case if in any event the statute didn't apply to State-owned railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.106" offset="930611">The Court determined, though, that the waiver was adequate and that jurisdiction did exist in the Federal courts for a cause of action under the Jones Act-FELA to be brought against the State-owned entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.515" offset="988289">We contend that if there is any further doubt or dispute that the railroad in this case, by a series of methods has... South Carolina has consented or surrendered... whatever phraseology that may be in current vogue... to the mandate of the Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.131" offset="1074702">This is not consent to where they may be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.749" offset="1093197">This is not consent to be sued in the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.201" offset="1106989">It is, however, consent to be covered by the cause of action created by the FELA or the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.271" offset="1131231">We recall that in the past case we just discussed, consent was found to overcome the express constitutional bar of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.793" offset="1173340">We recall in the case of Clark v. Barnard that the filing of a piece of paper by a State in a Federal court can submit to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.547" offset="1208344">This is not a waiver or a consent or a surrender to anything expressly granted to the States in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.588" offset="1244498">This is a consent, however, we contend, to the reach of Congress under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.408" offset="1271770">We feel that here are two or three types of express consent, depending upon the cases that one looks to from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.562" offset="1300400">The cases that talk about the commerce clause and its effect under the plan of the convention certainly would authorize a finding that any State that engages in interstate commerce does so with the firm understanding that at the time the State came into the Union, it surrendered its authority over interstate commerce to the express clause of the commerce clause in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.546" offset="1400397">We, in this case, however, have more.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.530" offset="1408338">We have specific statutory acknowledgment by the South Carolina legislature that recognizes its obedience and obeisance, if you will, to Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.187" offset="1454940">We point out in our brief that at the time the defendant entity was created, the South Carolina legislature directed that they comply with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.709" offset="1492975">The South Carolina legislature acknowledged that they were operating under certificates issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.613" offset="1520664">And the South Carolina legislature acknowledged that they were to be governed by the rules and regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.017" offset="1550235">This is clear, statutory surrender, if you will, clear statutory acknowledgement of the overwhelming authority of the Federal plan governing railroads in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.113" offset="1750646">But I say that even if it weren't specific enough, the voluntary act of the State of South Carolina has surrendered to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.852" offset="1785546">We point out that this... the whole reason for the concept of specificity is for clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.958" offset="1818042">How much more clarity could exist?</text>
            <text syncTime="421.327" offset="1827446">When South Carolina in 1969 made the decision to create the defendant agency, this Court by that time had decided five cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.933" offset="1861928">Maybe they were all wrong, but the Court was very clear in telling everybody in America that railroad legislation by Congress applied to State-owned railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.954" offset="1901948">A statute as interpreted by this Court, a Federal scheme of regulations as interpreted by this Court, certainly gives sufficient clarity and advanced knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.346" offset="1943535">There was no sandbagging of South Carolina here.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.762" offset="1953252">This statute was created in 1908, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.398" offset="1963806">The decisions of this Court started in the thirties.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.016" offset="1974255">By the time 1969 came along and South Carolina submitted this plan through its legislature, it was very clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.413" offset="4023822">They have absolutely no basis to allege that this catches them by surprise, that they had no idea when they went into railroading that they were going to be subject to FELA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.685" offset="4180975">So we think that the necessity for the clear statement in legislation has been supplanted and replaced in this case by authoritative and definitive judicial interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2034.784" offset="8281363">And that is that it's the very same interest at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.355" offset="8303619">I grant you that in the Eleventh Amendment context we're talking about immunity from suit in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.092" offset="8330578">And in the context we're here today on, we're talking about immunity in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.663" offset="8352834">But it's the very same State interest that is at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.483" offset="8368090">The clear statement rule grew out of a need to protect the State's sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.803" offset="8397347">The sovereignty didn't exist only as a limitation on Article III judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.706" offset="8416991">The limitation on Article III judicial power existed because of the pre-existing existence of the sovereign interests of the State, the very same interests that are at stake at applying general language to abrogate a State's immunity in its own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.753" offset="8489193">And I would suggest on that ground alone, that it is very difficult to distinguish the Eleventh Amendment line of cases and the requirement for a clear statement from the Will approach and the statutory interpretation question that we have before us here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.762" offset="8553246">Now, in fact, the logic of that carried the day with the trial judge in this particular case, and it was on that basis that he dismissed the petitioner's original complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.147" offset="11482722">Now, he talks in terms of needing some advice about being impacted, one of the things that our amicus brief points out is that in 1939 there was wholesale amendment of the FELA by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.156" offset="11542803">And by that time this Court had already held that States were subject to the regulatory power of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.560" offset="11576449">And Congress did not address that in any way when they made the wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.880" offset="11597660">Another question that was asked about the remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.416" offset="11607796">When Mr. Simons was asked a question by the South Carolina Supreme Court, my recollection is he told them that the man really was remediless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.252" offset="11635172">We point out in our brief that he is specifically excluded from the Tort Claims Act because the tort claims act didn't become effective until after his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.043" offset="11678326">We point out also that he is specifically excluded from the workers' comp laws by definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.281" offset="11703299">And this is very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.733" offset="11709151">We've had cited you a Higginbotham case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.666" offset="11716883">The Higginbotham case was a case before Parden which held the same way that Parden did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.368" offset="11739662">But its significance is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.670" offset="11744886">Higginbotham is Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.170" offset="11750842">Here we're in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.688" offset="11756903">There has been a subsequent case to the Court's opinion in Welch, the Laughinghouse case, out of the appeal court in North Carolina, all showing that States have relied upon the concept of preemption and Federal regulation and pervasiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.114" offset="11818656">And railroad men are routinely excluded from other schemes of compensation for on-the-job injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.868" offset="11845615">And you'll find this... and the South Carolina statutes exclude it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.986" offset="11858153">I know from my home State of Florida that you find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.736" offset="11865154">You'll find it in the Laughinghouse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.121" offset="11874663">The Laughinghouse case, the man... the North Carolina court dismissed his case for lack of jurisdiction in the Workman's Comp Bureau on the basis of Parden and Welch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.544" offset="11916354">They said true, Welch overruled the preemptive effect of the FELA for jurisdiction in the Federal court, but it's still good law insofar as the FELA being the sole remedy because Congress has preempted the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.303" offset="11971420">And you will find this... I haven't done a State-by-State survey, but I will venture to say that you will find in many, many, many States, and this is why we mention it in our reply brief the significance of overruling these precedents because of the reliance factor that Mr. Chief Justice referred to just last term in talking about considerations when cases are overruled or not overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.335" offset="12059505">And you're looking at a steady stream of opinions out of this Court concerning the railroad industry and it's uniqueness in this country and it its jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.691" offset="12096913">And to overrule these cases is going to create not only havoc with the other laws that we talked about, but you're going to throw a lot of people out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.860" offset="12125647">They won't be covered anywhere because everybody has relied upon it, and the legislatures in the various States have enacted legislation accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.783" offset="12157308">We know, in answer to the question concerning Feeney and the Petty cases, some argument was made about the fact that they weren't States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.556" offset="12200357">In each of those cases this Court proceeded arguendo as if they were States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.626" offset="12216658">And so certainly the bench and the bar of this Nation in reading these opinions reads them as this Court's pronouncements concerning State court issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.316" offset="12255424">Strangely enough, again, respondent acknowledges that it doesn't make sense, doesn't make sense to talk about jurisdiction unless there is a cause of action underneath it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.241" offset="12311117">And certainly that's the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.407" offset="12315819">The PATH case only makes sense if the statute applies to that State entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.644" offset="12348733">Otherwise, the Court didn't need to be concerned as to whether or not it waives its jurisdiction to be sued under FELA or Jones Act in the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.683" offset="12384886">If there wasn't any cause of action there to begin with, the case would have been moot and the Court wouldn't have heard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.837" offset="12409546">At page 22 of our Amicus Brief, counsel has cited the Court to the Lowden case, the U.S. v. Lowden, where the Court packaged up all the various railroad laws, including the FELA, did not make the distinction that counsel would make against us here that, well, if it's a regulation law that's different than if it's a money-damage law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.804" offset="12513409">Number one, the Safety Appliance Act is a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.089" offset="12526575">While certainly the Federal Government can extract a penalty common carrier by rail who violates the Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.862" offset="12561683">It is also, however, a safety statute enacted for the protection of employees, and it's part of the package.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.397" offset="12583731">And the Court said in the plurality opinion in Union Gas, many times money damages are the only way to enforce congressional dictate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.353" offset="12627616">And the Court further said in that case we are in a situation where only Congress can act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.907" offset="12649768">Only Congress can act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.275" offset="12659277">There is no question this is an interstate rail operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.226" offset="12671084">There is no question it's preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.826" offset="12677458">Everything about this operation falls under Federal control except now they would say they want to carve out this one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.416" offset="12703894">And it just doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.099" offset="12710581">It tears at the fabric of the scheme of things that has been put together by Congress and has been consistently approved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.938" offset="12741928">I don't know the answer as to whether, quote, "sovereign immunity", that principal that floats around the Eleventh Amendment, whether that protects an otherwise susceptible defendant from the application of a congressional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.150" offset="12810787">But if it does, we know it's clear it's not the pure Eleventh Amendment that protects in their own State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.952" offset="12833984">If there is any principal floating around that they're trying to take advantage of here, it is that principal of sovereign immunity somehow floating with the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.058" offset="12866375">Now, if the waiver can be found of that explicit Federal court lack of jurisdiction, we submit that consent or a waiver can also be found so as to get rid of that sovereign immunity theory that otherwise would protect them in their own court, if indeed there are two sovereign immunities in the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.537" offset="12948295">And if indeed the more stringent on, the one that's explicitly stated as a bar to jurisdiction, if that could be waived, then we'd take it as a given, that the subsidiary "common law", quote, type of immunity can also be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.714" offset="13001063">And if it can be waived, they have done it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.464" offset="13012034">They've done it by the virtue of their statutes showing that they knew when they came in we're going to be subject to the Federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.736" offset="13037112">They have done it by carving out railroad workers and not giving them a remedy under their comp law... again acknowledging that they know where the scheme for regulation comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.508" offset="13072220">And they have done it also in terms of acknowledging by virtue of their statutes that the Railway Labor Act applies, that they simply are governed by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.833" offset="13129481">Now... and they engage in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.220" offset="13143064">They went into a pervasively regulated area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.541" offset="13168351">All of this... all of this was done knowingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.207" offset="13179009">All of this was done after this Court had repeatedly placed it on notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.325" offset="13195518">We think in this case that we are not dealing with the historic powers of State government that was of major concern to this Court in cases like the Will case.</text>
