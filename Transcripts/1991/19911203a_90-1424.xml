            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="151395">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-1424, Manuel Lujan v. The Defenders of Wildlife.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.618" offset="185772">Mr. Kneedler.</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="9.657" stopTime="140.223">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="9.657" offset="189952">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.282" offset="208446">The Eighth Circuit, in this case, invalidated a regulation issued by the Secretary of the Interior in 1986 to interpret the geographic reach of the first sentence of section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.110" offset="271767">That sentence provides that each Federal agency, in consultation with the Secretary, shall ensure that any action it authorizes, funds, or carries out, is not likely to have either one of two consequences: first, jeopardize an endangered or threatened species or, second, adversely modify habitat that is determined by the Secretary, after consultation with affected States, to be critical for the species.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.250" offset="384303">The Secretary, from the outset, has construed the portion of section 7(a)(2) that concerns critical habitat of a species not to apply in foreign countries, because the reference to affected States gives it a domestic focus, and because application in foreign countries would present practical difficulties and impose this Nation's environmental laws and land use planning on foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.436" offset="481060">Neither respondents nor the courts below have challenged that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.997" offset="495375">In the 1986 interpretive regulation at issue here, the Secretary concluded, for similar reasons, that the portion of the same sentence that concerns actions that affect the species themselves likewise does not apply in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.586" offset="553681">The court of appeals invalidated that interpretation, thereby setting aside the uniform interpretation of not only the agencies charged with administering the act, but also the agencies engaged in furnishing assistance to foreign governments for projects in their countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.666" offset="613971">The court of appeals erred in two fundamental respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.538" offset="625465">First, the court should not have even reached the merits of the validity of the regulation, because the respondent organizations do not have standing to challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.574" offset="657648">The respondent organizations wholly failed to carry their burden of showing that any of their members suffered actual or threatened injury as the result of U.S. assistance to a project in a foreign country affecting their ability to view wildlife.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="140.223" stopTime="146.106">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="140.223" offset="712192">Mr. Kneedler, how does the citizens' suit provisions affect the standing inquiry?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="146.106" stopTime="197.999">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="146.106" offset="735806">In the first place, we think the citizen suit provision is inapplicable in this case because that refers to situations generally where persons alleged to be in violation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.144" offset="775931">The Secretary's interpretive regulation, which he wasn't even required to issue in the first place, in our view, does not fall within the citizens' suit provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.417" offset="804979">The provision that addresses the Secretary's enforcement responsibilities, which is what respondents seem to be directing their suit to, does not govern this sort of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.874" offset="842804">It governs a specific category of regulations under section 4 of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.356" offset="860776">So in the first place, we think the citizens' suit provision is inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.499" offset="873315">But moreover, the citizens' suit provision, as this Court has made clear in Sea Clammers and other cases, cannot extend the standing... the jurisdiction, case or controversy requirement... jurisdiction under the case or controversy requirement beyond that specified in this Court's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.930" offset="939039">So the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="197.999" stopTime="206.666">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="197.999" offset="943323">Well, I guess it could, though, provide that abridgement of the right that Congress has given would constitute injury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="206.666" stopTime="214.262">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="206.666" offset="978014">--Well, what would be... to be sure, if the statute defines a statutory right and then says that a person may sue for a violation--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="214.262" stopTime="214.882">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="214.262" offset="1008420">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="214.882" stopTime="307.631">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="214.882" offset="1010824">--of that right, then standing would result because Congress has defined the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.674" offset="1030050">But this... the citizens' suit provision does not define any substantive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.366" offset="1048858">Just as this Court said in Valley Forge, the APA provision, giving any person aggrieved a right to sue, does not define substantive rights, it simply creates a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.844" offset="1082713">So respondents would be required to look elsewhere in the Endangered Species Act for any substantive rights that they would seek to invoke in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.837" offset="1110716">At one point, respondents were arguing that they had certain procedural rights to have one agency consult with another regarding projects in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.092" offset="1143735">As we pointed out in our petition and brief, that holding by the Eighth Circuit to that effect was inconsistent with every other court of appeals that has considered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.148" offset="1179888">And respondents do not, as we understand it, defend it here, because procedural rights can only be invoked by persons who have a substantive stake in the agency's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.525" offset="1217400">So unless respondents can show that some of their members had an actual stake in a foreign project and were injured there, the fact that there might be procedural provisions under the act would not be sufficient to give them standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.782" offset="1262435">So to come back to your question, and argue this case does not arise under the citizens' suit provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.745" offset="1286363">It's essentially an APA challenge to a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.908" offset="1299006">And as such, as a... if the A... regulation is the agency action, this Court has made clear, just two terms ago in the National Wildlife Federation case, that unless a statute specifically provides for a... challenge to a regulation as soon as it's issued, ordinarily a person has to wait until the regulation has been applied to his particular case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="307.631" stopTime="330.666">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="307.631" offset="1381867">Well, I understood the respondents to argue that section 7(a)(2) provides that each Federal agency shall consult with the Secretary when action or funding is likely to jeopardize the continuation of an endangered species.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="330.666" stopTime="331.297">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="330.666" offset="1474027">That's correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="331.297" stopTime="337.782">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="331.297" offset="1476535">And they think that is the substantive right that they're seeking to enforce under the citizens' suit provision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="337.782" stopTime="380.949">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="337.782" offset="1502448">Well, if an agency that was otherwise required to do so did not consult or took action that would jeopardize a species, that would be a violation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.878" offset="1546856">But again, respondents have not sued an action agency, seeking prevent what they claim would be a violation of the act by that agency... the engaging in a project in a foreign country without the necessary consultation.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.346" offset="1588757">They've sued the Secretary of the Interior, who has simply issued an interpretive regulation stating what he believes to be the content of the section 7(a)(2) requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.301" offset="1628567">But the... but the Secretary of the Interior cannot require another agency to consult with the Secretary about a project.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.388" offset="1656884">So whatever may be the case in a dispute about a particular project, which, again, we don't have here--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="380.949" stopTime="393.678">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="380.949" offset="1675170">We did.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.632" offset="1681857">Do you think that the citizens' suit provision would enable a citizen to sue because the... a Federal agency had failed to consult?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="393.678" stopTime="537.371">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="393.678" offset="1726056">--It would confer a right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.979" offset="1731281">But again, the article III standing requirements would have to be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.801" offset="1742566">And as this Court has made clear, there are three essential standing requirements that, even under a citizens' suit, a plaintiff has to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.046" offset="1775480">First, the plaintiff must show that he has suffered some actual or threatened injury; second, he must show that that injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action; and third, he must show that that injury... there's a likelihood that that injury will be redressed by a decision in his favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.768" offset="1838383">And we've shown in our brief that respondents here satisfy none of those requirements with respect to any of their members in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.121" offset="1875790">Respondents, in their brief, focus on two of Defenders' members in an effort to establish standing... excuse me, focus on five.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.757" offset="1906406">The court of appeals found standing only on the basis of two.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.730" offset="1918213">It rejected the third, Mr. Plowden, on the ground that he hadn't even gotten within 200 miles of the project in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.095" offset="1943708">And any nexus that the remaining two might have had to a project was so insubstantial that the court of appeals didn't even address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.647" offset="1969935">So this case... respondent's standing would depend entirely on the ability to establish that two members that the court of appeals focused on had standing in their own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.785" offset="2010477">And those two members fail each step.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.268" offset="2024375">These two are Joyce Kelly and Amy Skilbred.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.638" offset="2033883">Joyce Kelly's entire basis for standing is one paragraph in an affidavit that appears at one... page 101 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.083" offset="2067633">In that... in her affidavit, Joyce Kelly makes no allegation that on her visit to the Nile River in 1986 she was harmed at all in her viewing of any endangered species.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.436" offset="2133044">All she says was that I will suffer harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.327" offset="2144642">And with respect to future injuries, she says I will suffer harm as a result of U.S. Bureau of Reclamation assistance in rehabilitating the Aswan Dam Hydroelectric Power... Power Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.375" offset="2192812">There's no indication in her affidavit, or in the Bureau of Reclamation report which she references, that that rehabilitation would have any effect, whatever, on an endangered species, and specifically, the Nile crocodile.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.813" offset="2238579">Moreover, Joyce Kelly has not shown that she actually has firm plans to return to Egypt.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.357" offset="2268776">All she says is that I have observed the traditional habitat of the Nile crocodile, and I intend to do so again.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.621" offset="2293854">I plan to return to Egypt.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.369" offset="2340770">Now... so she hasn't shown either actual injury in the past... she didn't claim it... or future injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.993" offset="2367310">Because, as this Court has said, with respect to threatened injury, the threat has to be real and immediate.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.266" offset="2388417">The injury has to be certainly impending... which suggests that any injury has to be immediately forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.132" offset="2415898">The sort of vague, unspecific allegation or assertion that Joyce Kelly makes here, that she intends to return sometime in the future, falls far short of that necessary to establish a concrete threat of future injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.946" offset="5131170">Section 7 as originally passed referred only to affected States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.047" offset="5147575">In 1978, Congress adopted an elaborate exemption provision to allow for projects to go forward, notwithstanding the strict, substantive standard in section 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.960" offset="5711193">Well, what the Senate bill was proposing to delete, that the conference report language refers to, was the whole reference to consultation between agencies and the Secretaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.885" offset="5742853">Well, that's... that... that perhaps inadvertent deletion of the whole consultation process is something quite different from suggesting that Congress intended to apply this specific provision of the act overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.783" offset="5790500">Again, the reference in section 7(a)(2) of the act, itself, to affected States, gives that section... gives that sentence a domestic focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.619" offset="5825818">And respondents here, are trying to make the improbably argument that Congress, in another portion of the very same sentence intended the agency's obligations to have a vastly different geographic reach, since the critical habitat portion of that sentence concededly does not apply in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.970" offset="5891228">Yet, they're arguing that the protection for the species, themselves, the species that would use that habitat, does apply in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.155" offset="5923934">It's also important to point out the practical difficulties and serious interference with foreign relations that would result from applying section 7(a)(2) in this setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.121" offset="5967819">And those are concerns that were discussed recently in the dissenting opinion in ARAMCO last term... which even though disagreed with a particular presumption in that case, acknowledged that where an act would interfere with the conduct of the Nation's foreign relations and diplomacy, the act should not be presumed to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.783" offset="6034484">And that is directly true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.124" offset="6043888">Because a rigid... an application of section 7's rigid, substantive standard, and elaborate domestically focused procedural provisions to projects in foreign countries, would interfere with the flexibility and responsiveness of American foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.543" offset="6097491">After all, foreign aid is... does not stand in isolation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.096" offset="6179725">Ms. Skilbred is a Defenders' member, and a professional wildlife biologist who visited Sri Lanka in 1981 and 1982, and visited the Mahaweli project site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.544" offset="6225491">She was deposed, and at her deposition she testified that she confirmed her visit to the project site by looking at the AID project documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.049" offset="6307516">To require her to actually find the endangered species is sort of a catch-22 because if they were easy to find, they wouldn't be endangered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2089.418" offset="8509011">The Justice... I would assume that, if this Court rules, that's the end of the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.513" offset="8529387">The Secretary will issue a regulation, the agencies will comply with the regulation, the Secretary will begin to consult, and endangered species will begin to be protected worldwide like the statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.170" offset="8568048">As to whether there is a possibility on the outskirts of reality that the agencies won't comply, the answer to that is there is a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.103" offset="8599708">But it is extremely unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.275" offset="8604411">I'd like to talk for a minute about the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.443" offset="8645162">The statute that's at issue is essentially the fourth iteration of the Endangered Species Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.208" offset="8676195">There was an iteration issued in '66, an iteration issued in '69.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.191" offset="8696153">The iteration in '69 created a listing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.583" offset="8709632">And under the '69 statutes, species throughout the world were listed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.646" offset="8725932">So that in 1973, Congress was writing against an Endangered Species Act that listed species throughout the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.849" offset="8754771">The 1973 act, in section 2, the Congress recognizes that the U.S. has pledged itself as a sovereign state in the international community, to conserve various species of wildlife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.458" offset="8805135">Section 4, which deals with the listing of the species, requires that both foreign and domestic species are listed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.564" offset="8833557">And there's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.415" offset="8840975">And the Secretary lists foreign species.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.846" offset="8850693">Section 7(a)(2), which is at issue, and which was written against the backdrop of the 1969 Endangered Species Act which listed species worldwide, says each Federal agency... it doesn't say each Federal agency except the State Department... shall consult with the Secretary to ensure that any agency action... and it doesn't say any agency action in the United States... funded or carried out as not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.251" offset="9000322">It doesn't say any endangered or threatened species in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.291" offset="9012548">But again, that section, in '73 when it was passed, was passed against a backdrop of listing of all species, both here and abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.469" offset="9053194">When the act was amended in 1978, and that's why I said that there were essentially four versions of the act that we're talking about, the Secretary's position was that section 7 applied worldwide.</text>

            <text syncTime="2661.394" offset="10796920">And there is support in the record for that contention, in a couple of places.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.907" offset="10810922">A couple of the deponents, including Dr. Elliott McClure, who was an expert in the area, testified that he had seen the consultation process work.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.930" offset="10899111">So the consultation process, at least with regard to the Mahaweli project, is made for the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.004" offset="10923353">The other differences between this case and the Foley, ARAMCO line of cases are that this act explicitly was intended to implement treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.803" offset="10978523">If you assume that the Foley, ARAMCO line of cases did come into play to begin with, those cases deal with labor and employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.170" offset="11020006">And you can say, well, those are labor and employment cases, but labor and employment is historically a local concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="2725.446" offset="11053129">And the Congress recognizes it both in the preamble to this statute, and the preamble to numerous other environmental statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.460" offset="11077162">And in this case, unlike the Foley, ARAMCO line of cases, we believe the statute is clear on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.896" offset="11106941">The mere fact that the Government makes the argument that it isn't, doesn't change the clarity of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.607" offset="11125749">With regard to the general issue of standing, we have a citizens' suit provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2876.975" offset="11659274">But the form of the... because the Secretary has abdicated his responsibility for a number of years and has told the world don't consult, and the consultation process has essentially laid waste for a number of years, it is within the sound discretion of the district court judge to tailor a remedy for that wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.916" offset="11786961">The first roadblock that needs to be removed is the Secretary's refusal to consult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.171" offset="11812038">If we were to go to an action agency and sue them and say you didn't consult with regard to the Mahaweli project in Sri Lanka, they would say we can't consult because the Secretary refuses to consult.</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.543" offset="11901482">And the Secretary has created an additional harm by going out and distributing the line to the other Federal agencies that consultation isn't required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.622" offset="11949860">The consultation process has lied fallow.</text>
