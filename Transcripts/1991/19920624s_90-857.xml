            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90847">The opinion of the Court in No. 90-857, Doggett against the United States will be announced by Justice Souter.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="7.807" offset="121985">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.529" offset="144868">In 1980, apparently without knowing that he had been indicted for his role on a drug conspiracy, the petitioner, Mark Doggett, left the United States and traveled to Panama where he was soon jailed on other drug charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.096" offset="191157">Federal officials asked Panama to expel him to this country on completion of the proceedings against him there and although Panamanian officials agreed to comply, they failed to do so, and in 1982, they allowed Doggett to leave for Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.015" offset="246850">From that point on, the government made virtually no effort to track him down and did not know that he returned to the United States a few months after his departure from Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.394" offset="280391">Some six years later, the government finally came across Doggett after he had married, earned a college degree, found steady employment, and had lived openly under his own name.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.187" offset="319575">Doggett moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the government's failure to prosecute him earlier had violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.700" offset="353639">The District Court denied relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.324" offset="360117">Doggett entered a conditional guilty plea and the Court of Appeals later affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the speedy trial claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.251" offset="391778">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, applying the criteria for accessing speedy trial claims that we announced 20 years ago in Barker and Wingo, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.093" offset="431170">The eight-and-a-half year delay between Doggett's indictment and arrest clearly suffices to trigger the speedy trial inquiry as the lower courts explicitly found the government caused six years of this delay by its negligent failure to track Doggett down.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.001" offset="482788">We accept the lower court's finding that Doggett did not know of his outstanding indictment and we therefore, do not fall him for failing to assert his right to a speedy trial until after his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.073" offset="523121">We view the extraordinary length of Doggett's pretrial delay as sufficient to place his ability to mount a successful defense at trial in serious jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.168" offset="559484">We hold that such presumptive prejudice is sufficient to carry a speedy trial claim when the government is at fault fro negligently causing a delay of such extraordinary length.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.273" offset="595846">Justice O'Connor has written a dissenting opinion; Justice Thomas has also written a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia have joined.</text>
