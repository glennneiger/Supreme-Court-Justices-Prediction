            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90849">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 90-1150, Willy against Coastal Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.033" offset="118957">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.312" offset="140064">Petitioner, Willy, sued respondent, Coastal Corporation, in State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.625" offset="161275">The Coastal Corporation removed the case to Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.886" offset="178307">The District Court eventually dismissed petitioner's action for failure to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.478" offset="200668">At the time of the dismissal, however, it also imposed sanctions for improper behavior by the petitioner pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.314" offset="248002">On appeal, the Court of Appeals determined that the District Court had lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and so ordered the District Court to vacate its order dismissing the case and to remand the case to the State Court once it had originally come.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.061" offset="307038">At the same time, the Court of Appeals affirmed the order of sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.602" offset="325220">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.316" offset="344028">In several cases dating back half a century, we have held that actions taken by a court bind the parties even though it is later determined that the court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.146" offset="391362">The District Court's proper interest in having its rules of procedure obey it did not disappear with the subsequent determination that it lacked jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.067" offset="427097">Its action was collateral to the merits of the case and so raises no question of exceeding the limits imposed on federal jurisdiction by Article III of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.624" offset="469311">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
