            <text syncTime="11.825" offset="189300">Mr. Minear, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="69.862" offset="421477">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="74.470" offset="439867">This case arises from the Federal Reserve Board's attempts to regulate MCorp, a Texas-based bank holding company that is operating in bankruptcy as debtor in possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.061" offset="482290">The basic issue is whether a district court sitting in bankruptcy may enjoin the Federal Reserve Board from conducting a proceeding to determine whether MCorp is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.197" offset="530773">That issue turns on the meaning of Section 1818 of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act, also known as FISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.004" offset="562015">Section 1818, subsection (b), provides that the Federal Reserve Board may initiate a proceeding like the one involved here to investigate a bank holding company's practices and to issue, if necessary, a cease-and-desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.593" offset="616350">Subsection (h) further provides that an aggrieved party make seek judicial review of any such order accord... in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.870" offset="657519">Subsection (i) then states as follows, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="132.479" offset="671939">"Except as otherwise provided in this section, no court shall have jurisdiction to affect, by injunction or otherwise, the issuance or enforcement of any notice or order under this section, or to review, modify, suspend, terminate, or set aside any such notice or order. "</text>
            <text syncTime="150.673" offset="744664">We submit that Section 1818(i) means what it says, and it prohibits any court, including a district court sitting in bankruptcy, from interfering with the Board's ongoing proceedings.</text>

            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="161.576" offset="788340">Now Congress... suppose the district court hadn't done anything except to say... except to remind the Board that the statute says that there's an automatic stay of all proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.709" offset="872873">Yes, Your Honor, the Bankruptcy Code does provide an automatic stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.831" offset="885307">It also provides an exception to the automatic stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.283" offset="895129">And if I may read that to you as well, I think it clarifies the stay is not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.548" offset="916236">It states that the automatic stay does not apply to, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="197.077" offset="930342">"the commencement or continuation of any action or proceeding by governmental unit to enforce such governmental unit's police or regulatory power. "</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="213.852" offset="997424">The lower court's ruling was not based on the automatic stay provision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="219.257" offset="1019054">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.944" offset="1021771">It did not even reach that issue, and it rejected all of MCorp's bankruptcy allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.989" offset="1041937">The court of appeals, in fact, largely agreed with our construction of Section 1818(i), that it would prohibit any such proceeding in the bankruptcy court in accordance with bankruptcy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.766" offset="1081121">It further held, however, that this Court's decision in Leedom v. Kyne, provided the court with inherent jurisdiction to enjoin the Board's proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.013" offset="1114035">Now we have petitioned this Court to review the Leedom holding, while MCorp has petitioned on the bankruptcy law issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.136" offset="1134515">And I would like to begin by addressing the question of Leedom, which has been a continuing source of confusion for the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.040" offset="1158130">Leedom arose out of a dispute before the National Labor Relations Board over a certification of a bargaining unit for certain Westinghouse professional employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.803" offset="1193238">The labor act did not expressly provide for judicial review under the facts of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.238" offset="1211002">This Court held, however, that a judicial review action could proceed notwithstanding the absence of any particular judicial proceeding that was specified by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.358" offset="1251439">It reasoned that a cause of action could be inferred because the absence of jurisdiction under the specific facts there would amount to the obliteration of congressionally conferred right.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.323" offset="1291354">This Court has described Leedom as a narrow and painstakingly delimitated decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.197" offset="1310789">And whatever the wisdom of Leedom under its specific facts, it has no application to a case such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.226" offset="1334927">First, here, unlike in Leedom, there has been no agency decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.630" offset="1352585">Rather, this case is like FTC v. Standard Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.488" offset="1363975">The agency has simply begun the process of making its decision by providing a notice of charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.017" offset="1386127">Second, and again unlike in Leedom, Congress has expressly provided that an aggrieved party will be entitled to judicial review once the agency actually makes its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.685" offset="1428758">And third, again unlike in Leedom, Congress has expressly foreclosed all other judicial remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.167" offset="1454672">In short, Congress has carefully considered the question of appropriate judicial relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.145" offset="1678593">One point, to clarify as to the first point that you made.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.097" offset="1690401">The... an order from the Board will not be effective for 30 days from the point of issuance, so that provides a 30-day window to seek judicial relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.373" offset="1719553">The second question you raised was whether a bankruptcy court would be able to review that.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.466" offset="1739929">Under FISA Section 1818(h), a court of appeals is vested with the jurisdiction to review the orders of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.010" offset="1774097">I suppose it's a possible argument that the bankruptcy court might have authority to review it under 1334(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="536.271" offset="2287142">At that point, there is an order to MCorp to transfer property to subsidiary banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.628" offset="2312533">At that point does 1334(d) come into effect so that the bankruptcy court then has jurisdiction to review the propriety of that order transferring property?</text>

            <text syncTime="556.044" offset="2366241">Well, 1334(d) gives the bankruptcy court exclusive jurisdiction over the property of the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.058" offset="2386303">Again, we have to speculate here on what might happen, if I can follow the course that you've laid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.775" offset="2409082">If the order has been approved, the first thing... has been subject of judicial review and has been upheld, the first question would be the content of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.943" offset="2437816">Now it might be that the order will simply direct MCorp to put together a plan for providing capital to its subsidiary banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.456" offset="2467805">If MCorp is subject to such an order, I assume that it would go to the bankruptcy court and seek such relief, that this is outside the ordinary course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.281" offset="2499152">MCorp could provide money to its subsidiaries, provided it falls within 363(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, but it's a matter within the ordinary course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.183" offset="2538753">Assuming it's not, MCorp would go to the bankruptcy court and seek approval of its plan to comply with the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.055" offset="2566234">But the Board's order should simply be treated as a law that MCorp has to apply... has to comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.350" offset="2587446">And as this Court indicated in the Midlantic National Bank case, simply being a debtor in possession does not exempt you from other regulatory requirement.</text>

            <label>Justice Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="619.769" offset="2621091">And I take it works that way under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.143" offset="2634571">If a bankrupt is subject to an NLRB action, it simply goes to the circuit court, the NLRB is either... if the NLRB is affirmed, then any property transfer is under the control of the bankruptcy court, and the bankruptcy court is simply bound by that decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.604" offset="2700399">I believe that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.776" offset="2705101">And there are cases such as Nathanson v. NLRB, which is a pre-code case, which indicates that the bankruptcy court should defer to the agency in terms of even liquidating back pay agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.256" offset="2747002">Now, of course, that's far down stream from where we are right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.067" offset="2758287">Our question is just whether the Board should be allowed to go forward with its proceeding in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.066" offset="2778244">The Board has been completely stymied in even going forward with its administrative proceeding here.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.767" offset="2797052">Now as I was saying, Congress has carefully considered the question of appropriate judicial relief in this case, and that clearly distinguishes this case from Leedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.483" offset="2831952">Congress has provided that MCorp will have full opportunity to seek judicial review of the Board's action once the Board definitively acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.605" offset="2860478">At the same time, Congress has been quite express and explicit in stating that MCorp has no right to review at all until the Board completes its administrative investigation and determines whether it will issue an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.287" offset="2907184">Now, no such order has issued here.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.381" offset="2915544">The Board has simply filed a notice of charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.443" offset="2923798">That's all that is issue... is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.848" offset="2933411">As a result of the lower court's injunction, however, there is no administrative record, there has been no administrative proceeding, and it's unclear at this point what action the Board might take.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.548" offset="2968207">MCorp really makes no serious attempt to defend the court of appeals' Leedom rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.842" offset="2989418">In fact, its brief it devotes a mere two paragraphs to the Leedom question.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.215" offset="3010838">MCorp argues instead that Section 1818's limitations do not apply in the bankruptcy context.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.274" offset="3039155">And as the court of appeals stated, that is simply not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.304" offset="3051276">It is important to recall the precise language of Section 1818(i): except as otherwise provided in this section, no court shall have jurisdiction to enjoin the Board's ongoing proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.957" offset="3097878">That provision contains no exception for bankruptcy courts, and the bankruptcy law itself contains no such exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.547" offset="3124210">Now as I mentioned before, MCorp has attempted to find an exemption in the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.920" offset="3153676">However, that stay is subject to an exception itself, and that exception precisely mirrors Section 1818(i).</text>
            <text syncTime="760.962" offset="3185859">It allows the actions of the Board to go forward, notwithstanding the bankruptcy action, and it prohibits the court from... in effect from enjoining that type of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.615" offset="3224520">It's important to remember also that the Board initiated the proceeding here to determine when... whether MCorp, which continues to function as a bank holding company, is in violation of the safety and soundness requirements of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.657" offset="3284602">And as I stated before, the filing of a bankruptcy petition, in the Court... this Court's words, does not give a debtor in possession carte blanche to ignore regulatory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.888" offset="3321591">Here MCorp has elected to continue in operation and continue to own banks and continue to operate banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.619" offset="3348445">Thus the need for Board oversight remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.946" offset="3357849">As long as MCorp continues such operations, it should be subject to the same regulatory requirements that apply to any other bank holding company in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.740" offset="3392958">MCorp also... attempts to find an exception to Section 1818(i) in the jurisdictional provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, as set forth at 28 U.S.C. 1334.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.296" offset="3443217">The particular provision that MCorp relies on, however, does not continue the exception to Section 1818(i).</text>
            <text syncTime="833.809" offset="3477281">It's no different than any of Title XXVIII's other jurisdictional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.338" offset="3495358">They are all subject to Section 1818(i) of FISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.931" offset="3513748">MCorp relies on the fact that 28 U.S.C. 1334(b) gives a bankruptcy court jurisdiction over civil proceedings related to a bankruptcy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.380" offset="3555544">But that argument really takes MCorp nowhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.535" offset="3568187">As an initial matter, all that's at issue here are administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.236" offset="3582920">Section 1334(b) does not speak to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.610" offset="3596504">Second, Congress has specified exactly what civil proceeding is available for challenging the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.123" offset="3622522">And as I have explained, that is the petition for judicial review under Section 1818(h).</text>

            <text syncTime="913.794" offset="3797229">There's no final order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.651" offset="3804647">So you have jurisdiction, but you don't have a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.167" offset="3814678">That's really the problem here, at least under your theory under here... under your theory of 1334(b) jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.116" offset="3842473">I mean, there has to be a cause of action against the Government somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.162" offset="3854698">I mean, that was the... that is one of the principal criticisms of Leedom, that it has inferred a cause of action against the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.172" offset="3910704">There would be a cause of action once the agency acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.531" offset="3920109">And again, this mirrors the APA as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.608" offset="3928468">There is generally no cause of action until there is final agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.295" offset="3943201">So again you see under our theory all the pieces fit together quite nicely.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.325" offset="3955322">Now MCorp has also asserted that jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. 1334(d), the exclusive... which provides jurisdiction over property.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.305" offset="4003282">And as Justice Kennedy inquired, the question there is whether there is any effect on property at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.898" offset="4025643">And clearly, there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.443" offset="4031808">The court of appeals recognized this fact as well at page 20 and 25 of its opinion, joint appendix pages 20 and 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.082" offset="4062319">The mere commencement and continuation of an administrative proceeding has no effect on property.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.673" offset="4080709">Any effects on property will depend on what the content of the order that is issued ultimately contains.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.999" offset="4105996">In short, we think that the court of appeals correctly ruled that there is nothing in the bankruptcy code that grants a district court jurisdiction to enjoin the Board's ongoing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.776" offset="4145075">Section 1818(i) provides that no court shall have that power, and there's no basis for making exception in the case of bankruptcy courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.696" offset="4172765">That conclusion gives effect to the plain language of Section 1818(i) and avoids an inferred repeal of Congress' expressed and unqualified command.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.972" offset="4209859">Moreover, our position really imposes no hardship on MCorp as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.439" offset="4227727">If the Court adopts our position, the injunction will be lifted; the Board's proceeding will go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.046" offset="4250192">If the Board concludes that a remedy is warranted, it may issue a cease-and-desist order, and at that point, MCorp may obtain judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.513" offset="4280076">Thus, the only hardship that MCorp faces here is the obligation to participate in the Board's hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.915" offset="4305676">And as this Court stated in FTC v. Standard Oil, that is no legally cognizable harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.007" offset="4330022">It is simply part of the social burden of living under government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.849" offset="4341411">If this Court agrees with our submission that the courts below lack jurisdiction to interfere with the Board's ongoing proceedings, then there is no occasion to address the remaining question in this case: whether the Board has statutory authority to apply its source of strength as it relates to the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.203" offset="4402851">Indeed, you'll face that issue only if you adopt the court of appeals' Leedom analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.310" offset="4423227">We think you should not follow that course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.544" offset="4432213">But if you do, then you should decide the source-of-strength issue in favor of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.713" offset="4448827">The Board is certainly justified in treating MCorp's failure to contribute capital as an unsafe or unsound practice under the facts alleged in the notice of charges here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.257" offset="4487070">As this Court recognized in its Lincolnwood decision, the Board has long recognized and frequently reiterated that bank holding companies should be a source of strength to subsidiary financial institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.049" offset="4530224">MCorp has not challenged the facial validity of that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.485" offset="4543913">The question instead is whether MCorp's failure to comply with that regulation is an unsafe or unsound practice under FISA in the particular circumstances that are presented there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.997" offset="4586022">Now FISA does not define the term "unsafe or unsound practice", and the question is whether the Board's interpretation of that term is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.822" offset="4617264">Here the Board has reasonably concluded that a bank holding company's failure to provide financial support to its bank subsidiaries when it is able to do so can be a form of mismanagement that threatens the financial well-being of the holding company, its subsidiary, and the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.706" offset="4672853">First the holding company's failure to act as... failure to support or refusal to support in this case its subsidiary banks can result in the wasting of an asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.828" offset="4713291">If MCorp's subsidiary banks collapse because of an absence of adequate capital, the holding company's own balance sheet will be affected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.582" offset="4812347">On that basis, I think that... you know, I can restrict my comments with respect to the source-of-strength policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.720" offset="4852889">As I said, it can be an unsafe or unsound practice to refuse to supply capital to subsidiary banks because it can waste the holding company's own assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.823" offset="4897297">It can also result in a run on the holding company's other banks if the public is under the perception that a whole... holding company stands behind its subsidiary banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.617" offset="4932510">And finally, of course, the public bears the cost of any of these types of failures through the provision of FDIC insurance and access to the Fed's credit window.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.442" offset="4971798">Thus, it's quite reasonable for the Fed to treat a bank holding company's refusal to aid its subsidiary banks as an... or to treat it as an unsafe or unsound practice in the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.374" offset="5015475">The lower court's injunction has prevented the Board from conducting an evidentiary hearing, and we think the better course here is to reject the lower court's Leedom analysis and allow the administrative proceeding to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.635" offset="5064585">But if the Court decides to reach the source-of-strength issue, it should decide it in the Board's favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1273.602" offset="5236471">And instead, based upon a congressional source that the Board is unable to identify, the Board has suggested that the entire Chapter 11, proceeding under Title XI may be eviscerated by the removal of all of the assets of the holding company from the holding company to the banks while it is in Chapter 11 to leave the holding company creditors of more than half a billion dollars high and dry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2111.654" offset="8588608">Indeed, the temporary orders were first initiated as a procedure preliminary to the final findings on the source-of-strength doctrine initiated by the Board of Governors in the fall of 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.868" offset="8641480">Now, we need not, we think, rely merely on the Leedom analysis of the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.754" offset="8681082">We think the analysis is sound, but more importantly we think that statutory framework in which the source-of-strength charges were brought, and its counterpoint with the bankruptcy require an examination by the bankruptcy court of whether or not the proceeding may go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.840" offset="8765405">And the reason for that is that there is an automatic stay under Section (a)(1), and here we're now... we're off the issue of the temporary orders, and we're on to the main proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.087" offset="8806365">And (a)(1) prohibits any suit or proceeding, including an administrative proceeding, that could have been brought prior to a filing of a petition from going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.315" offset="8851295">Now, the Board relies upon the exemption in Section 364... Section 362(b)(4), which says that a governmental unit proceeding under Section (a)(1) to enforce its police or regulatory power may, nevertheless, despite Section (a)(1), go forward to the point of judgment unless the judgment is a nonmonetary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.868" offset="8965503">And then under Section (b)(5) for injunctive relief, it may be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.537" offset="8984207">The issue then arises, it seems to us, for the bankruptcy, or here, the Article III district court, to determine whether this is a legitimate police or regulatory power enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.218" offset="9046900">Is there a police power or a regulatory power to be enforced?</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.076" offset="9062365">Because if there is not, then seemingly subsection (a)(1), the automatic stay, would apply, and at that point the proceeding would be automatically stayed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2347.980" offset="9533927">But here, we have a Chapter 11 case effectively being held hostage to the long process of the administrative proceeding to determine the propriety of the source of strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.475" offset="9599965">We're not just in the administrative proceeding going to get into is there a statutory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.161" offset="9622639">We're now going to get into, during these proceedings, what are the needs of the banks, what are the capital of the banks, how much is it going to be going forward and backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.845" offset="9657434">It's going to be a long and difficult proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.890" offset="9669555">And as this Court, we believe, urged in Timbers, the job in the Chapter 11 is to get on with it, not to prejudice the creditors who are creditors of the holding company, be they secured or unsecured, by a long proceeding, but to get on with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.821" offset="9729323">And if the court, an Article III court, were to determine that there is no legitimate source-of-strength power, then it would seem to us that the court, in determining whether the automatic stay is in effect or not, has the ability to determine that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.423" offset="9795674">In effect, it's really determining if it has jurisdiction because under Section 1818(i), which is the preclusion or deferral statute, even the section says that no court shall take action by injunction or otherwise to stay a notice or an order issued under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.367" offset="9887521">So the question is, is the order really issued under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.225" offset="9906956">Is there a statutory power to enforce the source of strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.473" offset="9923883">Now on that issue, we would submit that the record is hopelessly deficient to demonstrate a source-of-strength power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2509.994" offset="10181973">And I think there are two attacks to an exhaustion statute: one, a constitutional collateral attack, and the other, the question of whether the agency is proceeding in fulfillment of a valid statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.737" offset="10252922">And it is that analysis that we're asking the Court to make here on the source of strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.484" offset="10275909">Because the only statute that relates to this is 1842(c), and that in a very limited sense authorizes the Board of Governors to look at the financial and managerial prospects at the time of acquisition or merger, not to give it a continual let's look at the financial resources and prospects and let's allow the Board of Governors to make an unlimited capital assessment of a holding company's assets for all time's sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.268" offset="10407044">That would be an extraordinary transfer of the wealth of the holding company to the banks for the benefit of the FDIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.640" offset="10440585">And there is nothing in this statute that seems to indicate the power on the part of the Board of Governors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.497" offset="10472037">Nor is there, we submit, in any other legislation, such a power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.415" offset="10495651">Indeed, in the thirties, in the 1930's, the Congress of the United States eliminated the shareholder assessment capability in a serious of four amendments in 1933, I believe 5, and then later stretching into the 1950's, despite testimony during those hearings, which is cited in our brief, that by the Comptroller of the Currency, that this was a valuable tool in allowing the regulatory authorities to work with the stockholders and management of then-troubled and failing banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.759" offset="10641101">So that the Congress made a fundamental policy decision in the thirties to eliminate capital assessment abilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.820" offset="10673284">And it is in the face of that elimination that the Board, nevertheless, seeks to enforce the source-of-strength doctrine here, under the guise of this very vague statutory term of unsafe and unsound, which we think could be interpreted to mean anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="2833.692" offset="11476811">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.238" offset="11491021">To the point on the merits of source of strength, we would also point to the many, indeed I suspect a dozen, legislative initiatives that have occurred since 1987 when the Board of Governors first announced... announced for the first time in some 30 years... what the source of strength, at least in its view, was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.132" offset="11598541">It first indicated that the regulation why, under which it was purporting to adopt a policy statement, had something to do with down-streaming of assets from holding companies to banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.473" offset="11651935">And subsequent to that date, virtually every other regulator has taken the position that this is either flawed, it doesn't exist, or it shouldn't exist for a variety of policy reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.420" offset="11711704">Accordingly, it is our belief that the Court should defer to the Congress on the question of source of strength, require the Congress, if you will, if they determine that it's appropriate to have a source of strength, to so state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.412" offset="11779622">And as a consequence, we would ask that the Court affirm the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.862" offset="11809506">That concludes my remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.454" offset="11819851">And, of course, I would be happy to answer questions of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2992.378" offset="12111482">Yes, Your Honor, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.737" offset="12116915">I'd like to begin with this question of the temporary cease-and-desist order, since it's been raised again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.250" offset="12139067">This is something that we addressed in a supplemental brief in response to MCorp's supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.140" offset="12158607">As an initial matter, these three temporary cease-and-desist orders are all the subject of a pending judicial action in the Northern District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.465" offset="12187864">The complaint is set forth at page 174 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.309" offset="12203224">So if you lift the injunction in this case, then it will then turn to that judicial action in turn of the status of the temporary orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.181" offset="12230704">It's our belief that the continued viability of these order 3 years later is open to question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.099" offset="12258394">In the earlier proceeding, MCorp itself had raised that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.457" offset="12267798">At 116 of the joint appendix, they make the argument that these temporary orders are in fact moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.549" offset="12292249">They might well be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.830" offset="12297369">And that is something that could be determined in the Northern District of Texas in the judicial proceeding that they had filed, a separate judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.561" offset="12328298">Additionally, I'd like to touch upon this question of the title of the Board's action of eviscerating the bankruptcy--</text>

            <text syncTime="3055.494" offset="12364033">Excuse me, Mr. Minear, before you go on, you acknowledge those orders are outstanding or you do not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="3060.369" offset="12383469">--Two of the orders are outstanding, but we think that they are in effect, or their effect is questionable because of the bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.333" offset="12415338">There is a judicial action to challenge them, but nothing has gone forward because the stay that's in effect in this case has prevented anything from going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.205" offset="12450864">The Board might take some action to withdraw those temporary orders, but it can't do anything until we resolve this proceeding first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.874" offset="12477509">With respect... those two are... to get into the details of this, one order provided that MCorp would not pay any dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.010" offset="12514081">The bankruptcy court has stayed that, the payment of dividends, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.587" offset="12528396">The second order prohibited any extraordinary disbursements or expenditures, such as bonuses to management.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.225" offset="12554936">We believe the bankruptcy court will prevent that from taking place as well, so the orders, in effect, have no practical effect at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.738" offset="12576984">The third order concerned the source-of-strength proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.769" offset="12593075">And as we explain in our supplemental brief, the Board has suspended the operation of that temporary order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.016" offset="12618048">And the language that Mr. Miller quotes concerning the second amended notice of charges that preserves the status of the temporary orders, it preserves the status of that order as being suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.293" offset="12667158">So in effect, these temporary orders are just not a part of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.728" offset="12680951">That's simply a red herring that I think that MCorp has raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.305" offset="12695266">With respect to the bankruptcy proceeding being eviscerated by the Board's challenges, I think it's important to note that in our second amended notice of charges, the amount of capitalization that we indicated we felt would be necessary with respect to four of the five remaining banks was $21 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.018" offset="12762140">MCorp has asserted in the bankruptcy proceeding that it has assets of 1.5 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.968" offset="12777918">So I think that there's... you know, a difficulty with that, the argument that they make here on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.200" offset="12802786">Concerning the long process that would be involved here, according to the stipulation of our proffer of facts that MCorp offered, the hearing before the Board would take 3 days on the part of the Board and 3 days on the part of MCorp.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.321" offset="12859315">If this proceeding had gone forward as planned, it would have been completed long before this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.755" offset="12877078">Reorganization would be completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.847" offset="12889408">As far as the record deficiencies, I think that that is quite true that there are deficiencies in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.690" offset="12904768">And the very reason there are deficiencies in the record here is because of the injunction that has prohibited any evidentiary hearing to flush out a lot of the allegations that Mr. Miller is making at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.561" offset="12940295">Finally, with respect to the question of extraordinary relief here, I think that the question of relief is something that we'll just have to wait for the ongoing proceeding to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.087" offset="12990345">The important point is to remember again, Section 1818(i), which provides that no court may take any action to enjoin the Board's proceedings except in accordance with that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.662" offset="13028693">That is the matter that's at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.832" offset="13037366">Unless there are any further questions, thank you, Your Honor.</text>
