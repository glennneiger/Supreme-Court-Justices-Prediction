            <text syncTime="10.348" offset="181378">Mr. Landau.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack L. Landau</label>
            <text syncTime="11.998" offset="187961">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.486" offset="221920">This case presents the straightforward question of when a habeas petitioner who failed to fully develop the facts of his case in a State post-conviction proceeding is nevertheless entitled to a Federal evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.364" offset="285450">It is the State's position that he should be entitled to that Federal hearing only when he can demonstrate cause for his failure to present his evidence and prejudice that results.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.993" offset="335918">My argument this afternoon will focus on two propositions in support of that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.719" offset="358802">First, that cause and prejudice is required in this case because of the... because the Court's recent decisions requiring the application of that test in other circumstances are not distinguishable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.096" offset="420346">Second, that section 2254(d) of the 1966 Federal Habeas Act does not preclude the adoption of a cause and prejudice standard under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.386" offset="473531">The statute does not address the question of whether an evidentiary hearing is required, but rather the weight that must be given to State fact-findings when the hearing is to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.956" offset="523791">Before turning to those contentions, let me briefly recount the factual context for those contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.231" offset="556914">Jose Tamayo-Reyes was charged in State court with the crime of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.013" offset="583977">In accordance with a plea agreement, he agreed to plead no contest to the lesser charge of manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.950" offset="615742">Ten months later, Tamayo-Reyes filed a State post-conviction petition challenging the voluntariness of that plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.856" offset="651373">The State post-conviction court gave him a fair opportunity to present all of the evidence that he thought should be before the court on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.792" offset="687109">He now says that he didn't develop that record as completely as he should have and that he would like to supplement that record through a Federal court evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.041" offset="736114">The Federal court denied his request for petition... or request for the evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.034" offset="760042">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed that Tamayo-Reyes received a full and fair hearing, but nevertheless reversed a holding that the district court should have applied the rule of Townsend v. Sain, which requires a Federal evidentiary hearing as long as the petitioner's failure to develop the facts in the State post-conviction proceeding was not deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.490" offset="861920">Thus, the Ninth Circuit's ruling means that once petitioners raise their claims, they are not responsible for failing to fully develop this claims in the State post-conviction proceeding, unless they did so as the result of conscious, considered, deliberate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.532" offset="942064">In all other cases... he forgot, he failed to discover evidence that was reasonably available to him, or anything other... virtually anything other than a tactical decision... his failure to develop those facts at the State court proceeding requires the Federal court to hold an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.069" offset="1036209">The precise question before this Court, then, is whether the Ninth Circuit was correct and whether Townsend's deliberate bypass rule is still good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.905" offset="1075602">Turning to our first proposition, that cause and prejudice--</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="248.895" offset="1135579">And yet you obtained a grant of cert?</text>

          <turn speaker="jack_l_landau" startTime="251.116" stopTime="343.788">
            <label>Mr. Jack L. Landau</label>
            <text syncTime="251.116" offset="1144460">Yes, we did, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.628" offset="1150416">Returning to our first proposition that cause and prejudice and not mere deliberate bypass must be applied in this case, I suppose the short answer is that Townsend borrowed the deliberate bypass test from Fay v. Noia, which was decided the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.750" offset="1226903">Fay v. Noia, however, has since been limited in a number of decisions, and was ultimately overruled this last term in Coleman v. Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.548" offset="1270162">The basis for Townsend's deliberate bypass standard, then, is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.028" offset="1284059">And so also, we argue, should the rule itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.052" offset="1300150">There are, however, more fundamental reasons for rejecting the deliberate bypass standard in this case than the overruling of Fay v. Noia.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.858" offset="1335363">The court rejected the deliberate bypass test in that case and criticized it in other cases for good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.392" offset="1365561">And those underlying reasons apply with equal force here.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.165" offset="1380607">In those cases, the Court addressed the question of whether deliberate bypass or cause and prejudice should apply where habeas petitions... petitioners fail to raise claims, fail to appeal, or fail to conform to any number of other State procedural rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.456" offset="1457721">The same principle must apply here where the issue is whether or when to grant a State habeas petitioner a Federal evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.795" offset="1503174">This is so for at least three reasons.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="343.788" stopTime="358.547">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="343.788" offset="1515086">Well, of course, in all those other instances, I suppose it is true that we could look to an adequate and independent State ground as the basis for the procedural bar and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.674" offset="1566599">That is not present here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_l_landau" startTime="358.547" stopTime="399.153">
            <label>Mr. Jack L. Landau</label>
            <text syncTime="358.547" offset="1574122">Justice O'Connor, it is true that the Court has looked at the policies that underlie the adequate and independent State ground in some of its decisions, though not all, in those decisions in which the cause and prejudice standard is adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.460" offset="1653744">In the Davis case, in the Francis case, in a number of others, the Court has applied the cause and prejudice test for different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.386" offset="1689479">Having said that, we would still submit that the policies that are underlying the adequate and independent State ground test that were applied in those other cases apply here as well.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="399.153" stopTime="436.716">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="399.153" offset="1736604">Well, of course one other concern might be that here the Federal court has agreed to entertain the legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.131" offset="1776519">The Federal court is going to hear that issue and decide it on habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.613" offset="1794387">And maybe the Federal court should... maybe it's desirable that it be decided based on all the facts as they could be developed rather than simply on the record below.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.553" offset="1862201">I think there are some differences here that you have to come to grips with.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_l_landau" startTime="436.716" stopTime="475.202">
            <label>Mr. Jack L. Landau</label>
            <text syncTime="436.716" offset="1886860">My response to that, Justice O'Connor, would be that Federal habeas petitioners get a single opportunity to make their factual record or show cause for failure to do so, as this Court held in the McCleskey case just this last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.008" offset="1955928">Why should State petitioners be treated differently and have an easier time of obtaining the second evidentiary hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="461.314" offset="1985185">As this Court said in the Francis case when considering whether or not to adopt the deliberate... or the cause and prejudice standard that it had in Davis, we shouldn't be treating State and Federal petitioners differently.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="475.202" stopTime="484.328">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="475.202" offset="2040774">Well, McCleskey was a State prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.574" offset="2054253">He was a State prisoner on Federal habeas.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_l_landau" startTime="484.328" stopTime="492.544">
            <label>Mr. Jack L. Landau</label>
            <text syncTime="484.328" offset="2077241">That is true, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.639" offset="2086540">But the question in that case was the extent to which you get a successive habeas--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="492.544" stopTime="515.798">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="492.544" offset="2110155">Yes, and we made it very clear that it is the duty of the petitioner to the extent possible to bring all of his claims in the first proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.980" offset="2147876">But doesn't that mean that that first proceeding is of the greatest importance and so... isn't that an argument, at least, for saying that there should be a full fact-finding and evidentiary hearing at that stage?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_l_landau" startTime="515.798" stopTime="535.683">
            <label>Mr. Jack L. Landau</label>
            <text syncTime="515.798" offset="2203151">--Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.020" offset="2208062">And that, we believe is one of the most important reasons why there should be a cause and prejudice test applied in this circumstance and cases like it, so that there is the proper incentive for petitioners to develop the facts at the first opportunity, which is the State petition.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="535.683" stopTime="550.543">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="535.683" offset="2282668">Well, I said first opportunity and my submission to you was that it was the first hearing in Federal court where the statute, one of the provisions of the statute for disregarding the State's finding is that the facts were not adequately developed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_l_landau" startTime="550.543" stopTime="708.923">
            <label>Mr. Jack L. Landau</label>
            <text syncTime="550.543" offset="2342122">Well, as the Court has observed repeatedly in its cause and prejudice tests, one of the most important defects of the deliberate bypass test is that it fails to pay proper respect to the State's role in the overall criminal adjudication process.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.398" offset="2441492">This consideration is what underlies all of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.561" offset="2462181">It should apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.893" offset="2467510">Why, for example, should we require habeas petitioners to raise a claim and then not require them to offer all the evidence in support of that claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="592.628" offset="2510456">What's the purpose of having them raise that claim if not to offer all the evidence in support of that claim at one time?</text>
            <text syncTime="600.785" offset="2543056">The consequences of failing to treat those two situations is the same, whether we're talking about the difference... the similarities between failure to raise a claim and to provide all your evidence, or the Federal evidentiary hearing, in the question that you put to me, is more than rhetorical.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.947" offset="2615781">And that is because the Court has repeatedly said that it is the State court that is the best place to develop the factual record.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.052" offset="2652144">The State court hearing is the closest in time to the factual events that are the heart of these petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.798" offset="2687148">The witnesses are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.580" offset="2694253">They have fresh memories.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.420" offset="2701672">The court sees all of them at once, not piecemeal over the course of 6, 8, or 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.923" offset="2723615">And the State court is best able to see how all those parts fit into a coherent whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.039" offset="2752140">So accuracy, efficiency, and justice on the part of all parties involved in the system are served by having the factual record developed as early as possible in the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.547" offset="2806162">Deliberate bypass works against those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.711" offset="2822776">It provides, we submit, insufficient incentive for petitioners to develop as fully as they can the record in the post-conviction hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.325" offset="2865198">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.678" offset="2878678">This in turn imposes costs on both the Federal and State components of this partnership that is the joint Federal and State criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.497" offset="2937923">For example, it wastes the resources of the State and frustrates their attempt to come to the right decision based on all the evidence that is before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="732.209" offset="3068744">It is true that the respondent, Tamayo-Reyes, has argued that in enacting the statute in 1966, specifically section 2254(d), that Congress somehow adopted the deliberate bypass test of Townsend.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.180" offset="3132692">We think that's incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.311" offset="3141156">The statute and Townsend serve related but very different purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.654" offset="6562570">I believe that that affidavit is evidence which shows that the hearing in the State court did not result in adequate development of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.451" offset="6605724">But even absent that affidavit, we have on the meager record which was created in the State post-conviction proceeding, the person who was hired as an interpreter saying that all he told Mr. Tamayo-Reyes was murder is killing someone without permission and manslaughter is less than murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.457" offset="6697780">The importance of the Federal hearing would be to more fully develop the manner in which the interpretation defect did not convey what is required in order for a person to understand the mens rea elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.449" offset="6765698">The standards under which Mr. Tamayo-Reyes is seeking a hearing have been in effect for nearly 30 years... standards which were set out in Townsend and adopted at least twice by enactments of Congress, standards which have provided strong protection to State interests during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.703" offset="6862769">We submit that this Court should not and perhaps cannot change what Congress has enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.979" offset="6899863">Moreover, we submit that as a policy matter, no change is needed because very few hearings are in fact held in habeas corpus cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.918" offset="6951585">And because the entire scheme of the law in the habeas area provides very strong protection to State interests, not only through the Townsend standard, but also through the exhaustion requirements and the separate presumption of correctness which would apply once an evidentiary hearing is held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.744" offset="7038939">The question presented here, as distinguished from the question presented in McCleskey, Coleman, and all of the other cases in which the cause and prejudice standard has been adopted, is not whether the Federal courts should exercise their jurisdiction but how the Federal courts should carry out their functions once they have made the decision that the door to the courthouse should be opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.864" offset="7163386">The interests of the Federal courts and of the Federal Government in that situation are distinct from the interests which apply and which have been balanced in those areas when this Court has concluded that State interests are sufficiently strong so that the courthouse door should not be opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.697" offset="7254710">What the State is seeking here is a rule which ignores those distinctions and which would push the pendulum of federalism too far toward the interests of the States and intrude on the function which is inherent in the Federal bench in carrying out its responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.274" offset="7345094">As we take a more detailed look at the issues and interests which are applicable here, I believe that we see at least three separate lines of argument which support the position which Mr. Tamayo-Reyes is advancing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.260" offset="7448957">First, I believe that there are very strong statutory arguments which are evident from a review of the entire habeas corpus statutory scheme, not only section 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.900" offset="7507576">As part of that statutory scheme, I will refer to the rules promulgated in 1976 and '77.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.774" offset="7542998">The second tier of argument involves the interests which are at stake in this situation, as distinguished from the interests at stake in McCleskey or the Wainwright-type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.965" offset="7603811">And third, we have the multileveled interests... protections to the State interest which exist through the exhaustion requirement and the presumption of correctness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.774" offset="7659086">In looking at the statutory scheme, I believe that it is critical to examine not only what Congress did in section 2254 in 1966, but also what it did in section 2244 and did not do in section 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.608" offset="7750410">In 1966, Congress created a presumption of finality in section 2244.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.806" offset="7791161">Congress concluded that when a successive petition is filed it is appropriate to preclude additional evidentiary review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.374" offset="7837450">Congress did not import that same concept of finality into section 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.007" offset="7867961">To the contrary, in section 2254, Congress created an evidentiary rule which would be applicable once the hearing was being held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.565" offset="7910175">At the same time, in section 2241, Congress expanded the jurisdiction of the district courts so that the evidentiary hearings which Congress was clearly contemplating would take place under the decisions which were handed down in 1963... could take place in a more convenient form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.060" offset="8000140">So that the entire scheme as enacted in 1966 is replete with reference to hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.358" offset="8033368">And indeed, when Congress passed section 2254 and established the presumption of correctness, it assumed and built on and around the standard which had been set down in Townsend.</text>

            <text syncTime="2499.950" offset="10139778">If they are seen as applying at separate stages of the proceeding, so that one would have to first overcome Townsend before getting a hearing, then in that hearing have to overcome the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.881" offset="10195471">I think that it is reasonable to assume that Congress enacted a very difficult evidentiary presumption for a petitioner to overcome, based on the type of standard which would be applied in the first instance in determining whether or not the hearing should be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.050" offset="10268196">If the presumption of correctness as it applies in 2254(d) is made more difficult for a petitioner to overcome, it seems to me that the Court would be undoing what Congress set out to do when it enacted that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.153" offset="10340607">If we can't get a hearing unless cause and prejudice is shown, Congress' desire to provide protection through the presumption of correctness is less necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.342" offset="10393270">And I don't believe that this Court should take that step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.654" offset="10406540">In addition to the statute, however, I believe it is important to look at the rules which were adopted in 1976 and '77.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.611" offset="10450426">Rule 8 in particular, and the advisory committee notes to rule 8, again, make reference to Townsend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.278" offset="10489087">And those rules, as are the statutes, are full of reference to evidentiary hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.834" offset="10523256">They are built on the assumption that habeas corpus is not an appellate process and that hearings will be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.838" offset="10555334">And the fact that Congress adopted those rules in 1976 with knowledge of, we have to assume, what they meant, and with the advisory committee report available to it, provides further evidence that the Townsend language has been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.893" offset="10647494">In addition, a number of decisions of this Court have called section 2254(d) a codification of Townsend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.210" offset="10696813">I recognize that there is some dispute in the case law about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.654" offset="10718547">However, in a number of decisions, including decisions in the last several years, this Court has used that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.339" offset="10745296">And to the extent that the Court has recognized that section 2254(d) codified Townsend, the State is not only asking you to overrule Townsend, but also to revisit a number of other cases in which that position has been stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.742" offset="10818962">In looking at the decision in McCleskey, which was handed down last term, the State says that it is indistinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.754" offset="10890955">We respectfully submit that it is not only distinguishable, but the analysis which the Court undertook in that case supports the position that Mr. Tamayo-Reyes is taking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.591" offset="10942364">First, McCleskey specifically acknowledged that it was not changing the law, and that what was being stated in that case was consistent with the historical decisions of the Court in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.784" offset="11019060">That is clearly not the situation that we're dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.599" offset="11038390">Second, in McCleskey, the Court acknowledged that that was an area in which the Court had taken the lead, and in which Congress' enactments had not been intended to preclude further judicial development of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.289" offset="11109130">That is distinguishable from this situation in which the entire history of congressional enactments in the area of habeas corpus is replete with evidentiary hearing language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.058" offset="11164196">Third, McCleskey saw a very close parallel between the question of inadequate and independent State ground, which underlies the cause and prejudice analysis, and the procedural default which occurs in the successive petition area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.045" offset="11260118">Here we do not have a procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.268" offset="11277045">To the extent that the State was attempting to suggest in its reply brief that Oregon law might consider this situation a procedural default situation, it is important to look not only to the rules which they have cited, but in addition, rule 71 of the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.252" offset="11364921">As we indicated in our brief, the Oregon courts have in some areas adopted the Townsend and Fay language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.368" offset="11401388">Rule 71 of the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure provides for relief from judgment under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.983" offset="11439840">And those circumstances include mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.648" offset="11470560">And I submit that the entire Oregon statutory scheme, if it is applicable at all... and I don't know that that is clear in this situation... makes it crystal clear that we are not dealing here with a procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.469" offset="11533776">The State court reached the merits, decided the case on the merits, and that is entirely distinct from the types of cases in which cause and prejudice has been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.957" offset="11579752">The McCleskey decision is distinguishable for yet another reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.941" offset="11611726">In looking at section 2244(b), one finds a compound standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.417" offset="11641610">Congress has indicated that a successive petition can be precluded if a claim was deliberately withheld or a petitioner otherwise abused the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.855" offset="11695318">To the extent that the discussion in McCleskey looked at the statutory language, it would have been focusing perhaps on both sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.595" offset="11746309">The fact that Congress has in it otherwise abuse the writ makes it very clear that Congress was not intending to limit this Court's authority to continue to define when an abuse of the writ should be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.095" offset="11816317">McCleskey is further distinguishable because here we have an entire statutory scheme to inform the discussion about when a hearing should be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.318" offset="11889251">There, nothing similar exists to the language which we have in 2241, 2243, 44, and most of the statutory and rule provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.386" offset="11945466">When the State suggests that the policy which has led this Court to conclude that the cause and prejudice standard should be applied is applicable here, we submit that they overlook several important distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.963" offset="12047762">One of the most important is the interest that the Federal court has in being able to faithfully carry out its responsibilities when the door is opened.</text>

            <text syncTime="3180.465" offset="12861842">I would like to make a couple of points following up on Mr. Wax's remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.850" offset="12883367">First, he has referred to the record to demonstrate the deficiency of the State court hearing and the necessity for the Federal evidentiary hearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.538" offset="12938119">I want to refer to that bit of the record as well because I think it makes the point that I'm trying to make, or that I tried to make in my opening remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.173" offset="12964660">If you take a look at that in the joint appendix, the deposition of the interpreter indicates not that the translation was in anyway inadequate, it demonstrates that he didn't have a very good memory at that point 2 years after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.903" offset="13027562">How much more so, I would submit, would he have that problem, were the evidence to be adduced some 6 years in addition after that, or 8 years after the fact?</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.031" offset="13072075">That is the very point that we are asserting here, is that there needs to be built into this system incentives for petitioners to put all of their evidence in at the earliest possible point so that the witnesses, whose recollections are fresh, or as fresh as possible at the time, can have that evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.539" offset="13186073">Our concern is that the application of the deliberate bypass works against that and that the cause and prejudice tests provides the kind of further incentive that would ensure that the record is--</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.247" offset="13600898">That is true, but if you look at that legislative history, the comments are twofold.</text>

            <text syncTime="3386.482" offset="13685848">As the Court has... as this Court has observed in Sumner v.
