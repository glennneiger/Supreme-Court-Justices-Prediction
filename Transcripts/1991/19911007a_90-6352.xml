            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143843">We'll hear argument now in No. 90-6352, Diane Griffin v. the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.357" offset="177175">Mr. Logan.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael G. Logan</label>
            <text syncTime="10.388" offset="185325">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.589" offset="202148">Diane Griffin was convicted in a single count in 23 counts of an indictment centering around a major drug prosecution in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.492" offset="237779">In the count in which she was charged, there were two objects of this conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.335" offset="257110">During the trial, and at the end of the Government's case, it became clear, as a lawyer, that the evidence was insufficient as presented by the Government and the DEA object.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.625" offset="318341">At that time, Griffin made a motion for a directed finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.763" offset="342792">The Government made argument, and during that argument conceded that the evidence was insufficient on that object.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.901" offset="367347">At that time, Griffin made a motion for a severance for reasons that I set out in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.352" offset="393156">At the end of the entire case, the evidence really didn't change.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.741" offset="410710">And prior to submission of the instructions to the jury, Griffin asked for several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.784" offset="438922">One of the things that she asked for was that the insufficient object be removed from the jury's consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.156" offset="468388">And she submitted a jury instruction that did just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.826" offset="483121">That instruction was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.904" offset="495451">As an alternative, she submitted a set of special interrogatories, wherein the jury would have told the court which of the two objects the jury was using as a basis for the finding of guilt if there was going to be a finding of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.568" offset="570057">Those instructions were also denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.267" offset="596911">At the end of the jury's deliberation, there was a finding of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.078" offset="620107">It was a general verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.141" offset="624392">And I submit to this Court, I submitted to the court at the time, I submitted it to the court of appeals, that to this day we do not know upon which basis... which of the objects this jury decided guilt.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="131.886" stopTime="137.508">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="131.886" offset="671307">Well, you know if you accept the presumption that the jury follows its instructions, don't you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_g_logan" startTime="137.508" stopTime="170.198">
            <label>Mr. Michael G. Logan</label>
            <text syncTime="137.508" offset="693773">Well, Your Honor, I think that's exactly the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.241" offset="708715">Because we follow the presumption the jury follows its instructions, because we believe that and we follow that presumption, we do not know because in the instructions there was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.753" offset="746854">The error was that the jury was allowed to use the basis that was insufficiently proven as a basis for guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.467" offset="789694">And this is a case where there was evidence concerning knowledge of the drug prosecution, of the drug dealing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="170.198" stopTime="188.395">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="170.198" offset="824594">But doesn't the issue get settled by the instruction on burden of proof and the quantum of proof necessary?</text>
            <text syncTime="177.804" offset="855001">And everyone agrees that there was insufficient evidence, and if the jury followed that instruction, it could not have convicted on that particular possibility.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_g_logan" startTime="188.395" stopTime="278.406">
            <label>Mr. Michael G. Logan</label>
            <text syncTime="188.395" offset="897423">Well, I believe that approach makes sense if you believe that the jury can recognize the legal insufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.955" offset="927621">And it's our view in this case, and I'm asking this Court to follow that view, that juries do not always recognize legal insufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.030" offset="963879">The trial lawyer in this case, and I tried this case, recognized that legal insufficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.215" offset="984672">The Government conceded the legal insufficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.901" offset="995435">The court agreed with both sides that it was legally insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.134" offset="1012362">However, in this case, Your Honor, there was evidence concerning... circumstantial evidence... concerning connection between Diane Griffin and the DEA object.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.332" offset="1053113">For instance, the Government brought in evidence that she lived with the kingpin of this major drug conspiracy; brought in evidence that she knew the major wholesale supplier of drugs in the case, Mr. Suarez.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.530" offset="1113926">There was evidence in the case that when Mr. Suarez came in for the first time to meet Mr. Beverly, he had to go through Diane Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.356" offset="1145169">Diane Griffin knew all of the personalities at trial, all of the other defendants in trial, including minor... relatively minor... personalities like Jim Dandy.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.867" offset="1179232">So there was an association.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.709" offset="1186651">And I liken this situation, Your Honors, to that in Cramer.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.364" offset="1213296">In Cramer v. United States, the defendant in that case knew Fiel.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.048" offset="1239941">He knew these German conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.907" offset="1247464">He met with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.126" offset="1252271">And I think as the opinion says--</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.659" offset="5622452">What this Court has said is that it's not sufficient that the jury could have found guilt by reason of review of the entire record.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="1779.181" offset="7260539">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.992" offset="7271719">If I may, I'd like to first address the factual setting in which this case arises and then move on to the broader legal questions that the case raises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.081" offset="7316127">But I do want to address very briefly the facts in the case because Mr. Logan has suggested that the Government had pressed the DEA object upon the jury and the court as a viable basis for conviction when, in fact, that's just not the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.402" offset="7385404">And very briefly what happened in this case in closing argument was that after the Government's proof had essentially failed on the piece of evidence that we hoped would show Diane Griffin's knowledge... excuse me... of the drug dealing that Beverly was involved in was that the Government argued entirely the tax basis for conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.391" offset="7497312">The Government started out its closing argument by saying Beverly, McNulty, and Griffin are charged in count 20 with defrauding the United States by impeding the activities of the IRS and the DEA, which, of course, was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.431" offset="7561469">That was the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.165" offset="7564499">And, in fact, the evidence was sufficient with respect to both Beverly and McNulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.587" offset="7578187">But the Government then went to discuss Griffin entirely in terms of the tax purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.381" offset="7597309">Defense counsel came back and argued... it specifically said, you will not hear the Government speaking about the DEA object in this case because there isn't any evidence of Diane Griffin's involvement in the DEA object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.765" offset="7654883">And indeed, in the rebuttal summation, that is exactly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.905" offset="7671392">Now it is true that the Government at one point, the prosecutor slipped and said something about Diane Griffin's seeing cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.949" offset="7699605">This was because that was the evidence that we expected to see, but in fact, that was where the proof had failed and the witness didn't give us that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.555" offset="7730011">But upon objection, the prosecutor then got up and said, I am sorry, I misspoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.725" offset="7758641">I misspoke earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.552" offset="7765956">And I'd like to read this because it makes the point, I think, very graphically, that this issue was not argued to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.595" offset="7786122">"I misspoke with respect to Diane Griffin, and that is that I said there is evidence that she saw cocaine and there's none. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.593" offset="7810155">"And we're not arguing that. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.046" offset="7816006">"Diane Griffin is charged in this case with assisting, knowingly assisting Alex Beverly in hiding his assets from the IRS. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.840" offset="7855190">"It's that simple. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.261" offset="7860832">"And we believe that the evidence has shown that that's what she did. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.088" offset="7872117">So there's not an effort here, as I think counsel suggests, to try to get the best of both sides and somehow hope that the jury would find a DEA purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2012.931" offset="8195513">Mr. Bryson, wouldn't it be a lot simpler if the Government would simply charge multiple object conspiracies in separate counts?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="2023.442" stopTime="2211.163">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="2023.442" offset="8237518">--Well, Your Honor, I think that it would not for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.612" offset="8254236">That typically when you have a conspiracy that may involve two closely related objects, typically that is regarded as a single agreement in which there is only one agreement, even though it may have two objects, and which can't support... indeed, it would be a multiplicitous charge if we tried to charge it as supporting separate judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.666" offset="8338455">If you have two different agreements, in other words, if I conspire with someone to, let's say manufacture narcotics, and I later conspire with someone else to distribute narcotics, I may well have engaged in two separate conspiracies that can be charged in separate counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.487" offset="8401776">But if I conspire with a group of people to both manufacture and then distribute the same narcotics, even though there are technically two different objects to the conspiracy, it's just one conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.702" offset="8446602">And the Government can't separately obtain judgments on both parts of that conspiracy and obtain, among other things, cumulative punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.308" offset="8480979">So there are limits on what we can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.589" offset="8490174">And we have in good faith, only one agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.150" offset="8500414">And that's what we had here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.290" offset="8504907">Even though it may have multiple objects, we can only charge it in the single count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.225" offset="8528731">Our options were just limited in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.989" offset="8539703">Now, the basic principle, I think, that's involved here is a principle that is at the heart of appellate review of jury verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.548" offset="8577946">And that is we ask whether a hypothetical, rational jury could convict on the evidence in the record, could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.168" offset="8628414">We don't ask what route this jury may have taken to conclude that the evidence was established beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.884" offset="8667285">Now the defendant in this case says that we don't know what route this jury took.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.818" offset="8691108">It may have gone IRS, it may have gone DEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.177" offset="8700512">We just don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.926" offset="8703543">But that's true in every single sufficiency case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.284" offset="8716917">You invariably have the situation in which we don't know, and indeed, we don't even ask, what route a jury took.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.344" offset="8745130">We ask, did that hypothetical, rational jury have enough evidence that looking at the whole record, they could have found a way toward conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.591" offset="8782119">And to underscore the point, suppose you have a case in which the indications from the way the evidence comes in and the way the case is argued, the indications are that the jury may well have been particularly interested in a particular theory of liability and that you might well guess that that's what the jury may have been induced to convict on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.332" offset="8877100">But in fact, the reviewing court says that theory of liability is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.422" offset="8893505">It just... there isn't enough evidence to support a conviction on that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.295" offset="8912940">But there is other evidence in the record which could have supported the jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.169" offset="8936450">Then that's enough to uphold the verdict as sufficient, legally sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.401" offset="8953378">You don't ask how did this jury get to this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.556" offset="8966021">And if you conclude that this jury followed an improper path, you reverse.</text>

            <text syncTime="2240.744" offset="9106769">And let me give you an example taken from Stromberg, perhaps, if I understand your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.024" offset="9123905">Suppose in the Stromberg case, you had multiple bases for the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.865" offset="9155252">One of which was using a red flag to organize opposition to Government, which was essentially the ground that was struck down in Stromberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.659" offset="9194436">Suppose further that in that particular case, there was absolutely no evidence of any red flag at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.562" offset="9214080">There was the... the evidence was that there was whatever, violence, anarchism, or whatever, but no red flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.215" offset="9244695">Now even if the judge charged the jury that you could convict on the basis of finding a red flag that was used to organize opposition against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.649" offset="9286387">We submit that would be error because that would be impermissible ground for conviction as a legal matter, but it would be harmless because there was no evidence in the case of any red flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.052" offset="9327974">That would be the situation if you both had essentially factual sufficiency and legal error with respect to the same evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.485" offset="9357753">But that's a harmless error question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.484" offset="9365694">This is not, we submit, a harmless error question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.484" offset="9377711">This is simply a matter of how you look at sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.732" offset="9394743">Now, Turner, it seems to us, answers this question quite clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.839" offset="9419193">What Turner says, and I'd like to read, if I could, the specific quote from Turner because I think it puts the point better than I could put it by arguing from the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.928" offset="9463497">It says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.834" offset="9467154">"When a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive, the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.752" offset="9514801">If the evidence is sufficient, that is to say it's sufficient to get to the jury, with respect to any of the acts charged, that's enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.122" offset="9548238">You don't have to... and this is the following sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.263" offset="9556806">Here the evidence proved that Turner was distributing heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.761" offset="9578854">The status of the case with respect to the other allegations is irrelevant to the validity of Turner's convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.524" offset="9601841">In other words, once you satisfy yourself that the evidence is sufficient on one of the grounds for conviction, then you need look no farther.</text>

            <text syncTime="2470.466" offset="10025652">In Yates there was no reason to assume, as there is here, that the jury based its conviction on some other ground because there was plenty of evidence to support the conviction if the legal ground that was given to the jury on which to convict was correct.</text>
