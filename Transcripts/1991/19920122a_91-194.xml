            <text syncTime="2150.365" offset="8737646">The fact of the matter is direct marketing has become such a big player in the national sales market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.185" offset="8756977">It is, depending on whose estimates you use, 15 to 25 percent of total retail sales in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.006" offset="8780278">And I think the combination of the changing marketplace, the ease of communication that goes on that facilitates this, and the fact that the collection burdens have gone down substantially because of technological developments, make the world a very different place in 1992 than it was in 1967 when Bellas Hess was decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2189.025" offset="8892291">The same year, in the National Geographic test... case, which has been alluded to by the other side, this Court severed the connection between the tax and the physical presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.798" offset="8935445">In that case, National Geographic Society had two advertising offices in the State of California where they solicited advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.819" offset="8963448">And the tax at issue there was a tax on their direct mail sales to the State of California from another location.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.157" offset="8992810">And this Court said it's okay because of those two offices, even though there was no connection between the activities in those two offices and the tax that was levied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.996" offset="9024157">By severing the connection between the transaction and the tax, all of the economic justification for the physical presence test has been lost, as I think any economist would tell you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.019" offset="9064281">And that's why we need a new standard today, a standard that recognized the realities of the American marketplace today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.173" offset="9088941">And that's why this Court believes it's appropriate for... or the State believes it's appropriate for this Court to adopt something like the standard applied in ordinary civil jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2486.895" offset="10083788">What Bellas Hess did was turn the commerce clause on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.513" offset="10098208">Instead of leveling the playing field, it's given out-of-State marketers a competitive disadvantage... advantage over other marketers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.167" offset="10124853">Finally, it's made it profitable for companies to avoid the tax by setting up subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.821" offset="10143452">That's how Saks Fifth Avenue does it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.690" offset="10150975">They have stores and they have direct mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.107" offset="10160588">They have a subsidiary that does the direct mail so that they don't have to collect the sales tax, or use tax, in the States where they actually have stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.629" offset="10186711">That kind of thing doesn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.580" offset="10198518">So I urge this Court to the affirm the decision of the court below to close that enormous tax loophole that exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.568" offset="10222446">It's unjustified by economic circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.270" offset="10233313">I think the apportionment and nondiscrimination requirements of Complete Auto will be met, will ensure that the collection of the tax doesn't violate any commerce clause considerations, and due process will be satisfied by forcing the seller to collect the tax, only when it purposely avails itself of the privilege of doing business in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.196" offset="10301022">Mr. Gaggini mentioned the fact that North Dakota doesn't tie this tax to its sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.100" offset="10316591">Well, of course it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.417" offset="10321920">They don't have collect the tax unless they make a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.052" offset="10332369">It's clearly tied to sales within North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.088" offset="10344595">I urge this Court, therefore, in closing, to affirm the decision of the North Dakota Supreme Court, which I think was a finely reasoned decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2567.347" offset="10405617">First, National Bellas Hess was larger than Quill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.715" offset="10419096">Quill's sales into North Dakota were one-half when measured against National Bellas Hess' sales in '62.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.571" offset="10446472">If we adjust by inflation Bellas Hess' sales, they were nine times the size of Quill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.190" offset="10468937">This is a commerce clause case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.175" offset="10476879">I want to repeat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.344" offset="10481581">It's a commerce clause case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.527" offset="10486283">The State treated it as a commerce clause case, we treated it as a commerce clause case, but the analyzed it under due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.748" offset="10511151">As to the consumer going outside the State to buy merchandise, the State of North Dakota buys merchandise from Quill.</text>

            <text syncTime="2607.424" offset="10565904">We were surprised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.590" offset="10570606">It came up in a newspaper article.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.417" offset="10745835">We say that the State has powers, State police powers, but those are not equated with tax jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.654" offset="10770808">As to the North... as to the validity of National Bellas Hess, we cite to the North Dakota legislation, where the North Dakota legislators themselves believed National Bellas Hess controlling in 1987, when they enacted their law, and they petitioned Congress to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.883" offset="10839772">The State's audit of the consumer... this is not a consumer question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.686" offset="10858998">Quill sells to businesses and the State audits those businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.388" offset="10873731">As to one State, it's... Your Honor, we cite in our appendix, there are 16 States that have alternative methods of collecting this tax.</text>
