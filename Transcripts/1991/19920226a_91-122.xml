            <text syncTime="79.516" offset="454107">The deprivation occurred in August of 1988 when senior officials of the Puerto Rican Permits Authority, that is the respondent ARPE, denied PFZ a construction permit and dismissed its project.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.773" offset="595169">The conduct which gave rise to PFZ's claim was the deliberate refusal by ARPE to review and process a set of construction drawings which PFZ had submitted to the agency in order to obtain a construction permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.515" offset="650130">This was accompanied by the dismissal of ARPE's project based on the deliberate review of another different set of drawings which ARPE knew to be the wrong drawings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.879" offset="7431623">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.764" offset="7451162">I would like to start my exposition going back to what Justice Souter was asking Mr. Richichi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.187" offset="7480837">This case from the very beginning has dealt with his claim, with petitioner's claim that he has a property interest in a construction permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.458" offset="7517931">It has... if we look at the record of the case all throughout the briefings, from the district court on to the court of appeals, never ever did petitioner rely on these zoning cases from the beginning of the century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.016" offset="7572161">There is no mention of Nectow, no mention of the Roberge case, no mention of Village of Euclid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.170" offset="7596821">This has always been considered by both courts below as a claim that the denial of a construction permit violated both his due process right, procedural due process right, his rights to substantive due process, and his equal protection rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.096" offset="7656485">So I don't think there is anything in the amended complaint that would lead us to believe that he is arguing anything other than he has a right to a construction permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.320" offset="7705386">And our position is that he has not cited to any statute or any regulation or any provision in Puerto Rico law to demonstrate, that is he has not pressed the argument that because he did as the statute provided he was anywhere near the moment where he could get a permit.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="1915.500" offset="7798068">Well, Ms. Ramirez, I asked this question and was referred, I believe, to Note 5 on page 4 of the reply brief and the citation to certain laws and regulations in Puerto Rico that the petitioner says make clear that ARPE, if that's what we're calling it, lacked any discretion other than to determine whether the construction drawings had been assembled and submitted, and that they were required by Puerto Rican law to grant the permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.513" offset="7966192">Well, it is not correct as a matter of law, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.929" offset="7975805">The only... I don't have it in my memory what issue he was citing in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.666" offset="7998793">Of course this is after we made a comment in our respondents' brief that he had not pressed an argument that he could derive the property interest from state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.455" offset="8029931">And he is citing to what he calls history, history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.926" offset="8055845">But the only, conceivably the only statute in Puerto Rico, the only disposition of positive law that he could rely on is the one that was examined by the district court in opinion and order, it is page 481 in the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.852" offset="8119479">It says ARPE shall issue the corresponding permit based on the compliance with the regulation provided in this section, and that is 23 Puerto Rico Laws Annotated, section 42c.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.659" offset="8162738">Again our argument is we have to indulge the petitioner with all favorable inferences that will derive, reasonably derive from his pleadings, because the procedural stance of the case will be on a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.669" offset="8226790">He, the petitioner has studiously avoided to recite the facts of what happened after he made an original submission of plans to ARPE.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.394" offset="8277676">The complaint has a chronological recitation of facts coming from the Planning Board, which is a different agency, but when he goes to ARPE and he gets preliminary approval for effect of construction drawings he does not, there are no allegations from which we could derive the idea that the permit process was somehow so far along or he has progressed through the progressive steps so that ARPE would have no discretion to withhold the permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.913" offset="8395750">Well, is it your view that ARPE has a wide range of discretion in reviewing construction drawings whether to grant the permit or not, even when the Planning Board has issued its approval?</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.409" offset="8469729">Yes, Your Honor, that is our position and in our brief in response, respondents' brief, this is, we cited to the precise statutory provisions that should indicate to the Court that ARPE is a separate agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.301" offset="8521347">The Planning Board will approve the use of land for, of undeveloped land for certain purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.471" offset="8549977">It gives out the site permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.907" offset="8555724">But ARPE has been delegated with all the powers to decide how you are going to subdivide your land, the subdivision part, which is where construction drawings get into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.065" offset="8608387">You have to subdivide your lands in such a way, and this is why you require ARPE to require the endorsements of so many public bodies, so many commonwealth agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.487" offset="8642032">And the reason this project has not gotten off the ground is because the petitioner refuses to comply with ARPE manual of procedures which says you must bring construction drawings approved by all the, endorsed by all the pertinent agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.496" offset="8702114">And one of these agencies is the Environmental Quality Board who has been asking since 1974 for the filing of an environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.018" offset="8740148">And petitioner refuses to do it because he believes that once he got approval to develop the land in that site among the manuals he does not have to comply with that.</text>
