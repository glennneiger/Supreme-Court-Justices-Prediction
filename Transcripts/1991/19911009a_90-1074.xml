            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text>We'll hear argument now in case No. 90-1074, Wayne Estelle v. Mark Owen McGuire.</text>
            <text>Mr. Gillette.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This case is before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text>Like Coleman v. Thompson last term, this is a case about federalism.</text>
            <text>Specifically, it deals with the extent to which a Federal court may review the admission of evidence in a State criminal trial pursuant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text>Although this Court has long recognized that a defendant may be denied due process if his trial is not fundamentally fair, and has also noted that the test for evaluating fundamental fairness is less demanding than the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt test of Chapman v. California, it has not provided any specific guidance to assist the lower Federal courts in evaluating such cases.</text>
            <text>While we recognize, of course, that bright lines are difficult to draw in an area as amorphous as due process, we nevertheless believe that some more specific guidance can be provided, and that this case illustrates the need for precisely that type of guidance.</text>
            <text>I want to touch very briefly upon a few of the facts in the case which will highlight what the Ninth Circuit did, and then turn to the two-part test which we propose, and discuss the reasons why we urge its adoption upon this Court.</text>
            <text>Respondent in this case was convicted, in 1982, by a jury in Oakland, California, of second degree murder.</text>
            <text>The victim was his 6-month-old child, Tori.</text>
            <text>Tori was brought to the hospital emergency room on July 7, 1981, by respondent and his wife.</text>
            <text>She was pronounced dead 40 minutes later.</text>
            <text>Testimony from the coroner and the pediatrician who examined her in the emergency room established that she had sustained significant injury as a result of a beating.</text>
            <text>There were contusions on her chest and abdomen, and there was massive damage to her internal organs.</text>
            <text>Both of those witnesses were allowed to testify as experts that Tori was the victim of battered child syndrome.</text>
            <text>In support of that diagnosis, the experts were also allowed to refer to trauma apart from the injuries which had resulted or which had caused the death of the child... specifically, two earlier injuries: a tearing wound to the rectum, and evidence of previously broken ribs, or fractured ribs.</text>
            <text>Neither... that injury was not completely healed yet.</text>
            <text>Both of those injuries were at least several weeks old.</text>
            <text>The diagnosis of battered child syndrome, as well as the admission of the priors as a part of the prior injuries, as a part of that, was admitted pursuant to long-standing and accepted California case law, permitting the battered child syndrome.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Gillette, now that evidence, the battered child syndrome evidence, is relevant for what purpose?</text>

          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>To establish, specifically, that this child's death was not an accident; that she was intentionally killed.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>It was offered for the purpose of proving that the death was intentional.</text>
            <text>There has been an argument made that the jury might have used it as a result--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It was offered as a means of linking the defendant with the injuries?</text>

          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>--No, Your Honor, battered child syndrome does not identify the perpetrator of the offense.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I'm talking about what happened in this case.</text>
            <text>What... there was an instruction given by the trial court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And that instruction, apparently, said that the evidence could be used to show that the defendant committed the crime charged?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>The argument has been made that a jury might so interpret the instruction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, isn't that what the instruction said?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>The instruction referred to evidence of prior acts by the defendant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It said evidence has been introduced for the purpose of showing that the defendant committed acts similar to those constituting a crime other than that for which he is on trial.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>Yes, that's correct.</text>
            <text>And--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And what evidence was that?</text>
            <text>Did that encompass the battered child syndrome evidence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>--Well, the battered child syndrome evidence... there were... in addition to that part of the instruction, which Your Honor has read, and an... admonition to the jury not to consider any of that as evidence of character, of disposition, they were told that there was three, specific purposes for which other crimes, or other acts evidence was proper in this case.</text>
            <text>One was to impeach the testimony of the wife.</text>
            <text>The wife testified that she did it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Did that evidence, referred to in the instruction, include the battered child syndrome evidence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>To the extent that it encompassed the prior injuries, I would suspect that it did.</text>
            <text>Because one of the bases that the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Is to establish the battered child syndrome.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>--Correct, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And yet, the jury was told that it could be used to determine whether the defendant also committed the crime charged.</text>
            <text>And that does not seem to track what you say was the use, the relevance of the evidence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>Well, I agree that this instruction was not as clearly worded as perhaps it could have been.</text>
            <text>It is... it's also clear, though, that the jury was instructed that before they could use any evidence of prior acts, whether it was the assaults on the wife... which came in to impeach her testimony... or the evidence of observations by neighbors of his handle... brutal handling of the child, or if it was the prior injuries, that they could only use that evidence if they found a clear connection between the prior acts and the crime in this case... such that it would permit them to make a reasonable inference that having committed one, the defendant had committed the other.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, the California courts have acknowledged, haven't they, that this is an inevitable inference, if the defendant is one of the few people with custody of the child, and the child has a series of injuries over a period of time, it's almost inevitable that the jury will conclude that this defendant was either the prime suspect or the perpetrator.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>It certainly may be a reasonable inference.</text>
            <text>In this case--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>That's almost inescapable.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>--I think that's very often, often the case.</text>
            <text>And in this situation there were only two people who could have committed this crime.</text>
            <text>It was either the respondent, or it was his wife.</text>
            <text>And in addition to the other testimony, there was also evidence presented by the... through prior statements of the wife, that on earlier occasions before the death of the child, she had observed bruises on the child.</text>
            <text>And when asked... when the husband was asked, the respondent was asked about that, he hadn't of... had no explanation to offer.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And I guess the stand... the standard evidence calculus... it's not necessarily constitutional law, but just as a matter of law of evidence... is whether or not the permitted purpose for which the evidence is introduced dominates, despite its prejudicial effect in other respects.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.</text>
            <text>And we do not perceive that as being a constitutional issue.</text>
            <text>We see, really, a separation of the two parts of this case.</text>
            <text>The Ninth Circuit found that there was error in the admission of the battered child evidence, and of the prior acts, which were offered in support of it, specifically finding that that evidence came in in violation of California law.</text>
            <text>Clearly, that was an inappropriate determination for the Ninth Circuit to make.</text>
            <text>They had no business reevaluating California law.</text>
            <text>California courts had held... the California Court of Appeal, had specifically held that that evidence was admissible and proper under California law, and I think it must be accepted as a given, for purposes of this case, that the battered child--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Whether they were right or wrong about that, in the end, they had to find that the admission of the evidence was unconstitutional.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>--Precisely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>In the long run, I think that it doesn't matter so much whether the California court was right or wrong.</text>
            <text>The question is, the evidence having come in, this evidence not being shown to violate any specific protection or guarantee of the Bill of Rights, can the defendant, nevertheless, establish that its use in this case denied him a fundamentally fair trial?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, the California... to say that... whether there... you know... it doesn't make any difference whether the California court was right or wrong.</text>
            <text>You know, there is no such thing as right or wrong, a State law and Federal habeas.</text>
            <text>If it doesn't violate the Constitution, it's no concern of the Federal habeas court, isn't that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>That is precisely right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>And when I say right or wrong, I don't think it matters whether the California court in this case had found that it was admissible under California law, or if it had found that it was inadmissible under California law.</text>
            <text>And I want to talk about the... primarily about the question of the admission of the evidence, and the extent to which the admission of evidence--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>May I ask, though, does it make any difference whether the evidence was admitted for the purpose of proving the battered child syndrome, on the one hand; or for the purpose of proving that the defendant committed the earlier brutal acts, and therefore to give rise to the inference that he may also have committed the one for which he is being tried.</text>
            <text>And that was the third part of the trial judge's instruction.</text>
            <text>Is that relevant at all, do you think?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>--For constitutional purposes, I think it makes no difference.</text>
            <text>The first question is, was this evidence properly evidence.</text>
            <text>The second issue is--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Let's assume it was clearly properly admissible for the purpose of proving the battered child syndrome.</text>
            <text>Does it also mean it's properly admissible to connect the defendant with the prior acts?</text>
            <text>And I... as I understand it, there's nothing in the record to connect him with the prior acts, other than the possibility he had custody of the child.</text>
            <text>But he wasn't the only one with custody of the child during those earlier times, was he?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>--I don't think that states a constitutional issue, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>The extent to which the instruction may have permitted that, does not necessarily establish that had it been used by the jury for that purpose, that it would have resulted in a fundamentally unfair trial within the meaning of the due process clause.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Gillette, I take it that in a trial in which the defendant is charged with the... killing this child, the State offers evidence for the purpose of trying to persuade the jury that he's guilty.</text>
            <text>And that would include the evidence of the battered child syndrome, would it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>Precisely.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>To narrow the... as you suggest... narrow the possibility to someone who intentionally did it to the child, rather than accident.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dane_r_gillette">
            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>That's correct.</text>
            <text>And the battered child syndrome does have added significance with respect to who did it in this case.</text>
            <text>Because very often, a part of that diagnosis, in addition to the observation of the actual injuries which the child has sustained, is evidence of an inconsistent or impossible explanation offered by a care-giver... and we use that term advisedly... as to how the child may have been injured.</text>
            <text>In this case, on multiple occasions... to his wife, to the emergency room nurse, to the police... the defendant, the respondent in this case, insisted that Tori had fallen off of the couch.</text>
            <text>Yet the medical evidence demonstrate, persuasively, that there was no possibility that a fall by a 6-month-old child, whether it was sixteen inches, as the distance was measured from the couch to the carpeted floor in this case... or even 16 feet... could have resulted in that type of massive internal and external injuries.</text>
            <text>In short, the battered child syndrome, in part, was supported by the fact the defendant gave a completely inconsistent and impossible explanation.</text>
            <text>Now, that brings us back again to the question that I want to primarily discuss with the Court, if I may, for a few minutes... and that is the issue of to what extent, and what is the process by which a Federal court should consider the issue of whether evidence came into the case in violation of due process, when there has been no showing of a specific violation of a guarantee of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text>And we think that there is a two-part analysis, a very limited analysis that would be appropriate for the Federal court to undertake in a case of that sort.</text>
            <text>The first question the Federal court should ask is was it relevant?</text>
            <text>If it was relevant, we submit that due process has been satisfied.</text>
            <text>If it was not relevant, the next step for the court to determine, the Federal court, is was it inflammatory?</text>
            <text>And to determine whether the evidence was inflammatory, we submit as appropriate the test which this Court has used in other situations for evaluating due process violations... specifically, whether there is a reasonable probability that had this evidence been excluded, there would have been a different result in this case.</text>
            <text>From by a reasonable--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Gillette, the only problem I have, is how it... how we should view the case in light of this misleading instruction.</text>
            <text>I mean, I can follow your argument that the evidence was admissible as a matter of State law, and that it's relevant to show that the prior injuries were not accidental, and that this was not either.</text>
            <text>But how can we justify the instruction that tried... said the jury could use it to link the defendant with the prior acts--</text>

            <text>Because I think that you need to separate it into two, separate issues.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>You look to the instruction, but you're looking for something different in that situation.</text>
            <text>You're looking... and I think appropriately you would use the test the Court stated in Boyde v. California.</text>
            <text>Is there a reasonable likelihood that the jury was misled in a way that would allow them to use this evidence in some unconstitutional or inappropriate manner?</text>
            <text>And it has to be a violation of the Constitution, in the way that it was used.</text>
            <text>Now, if the jury were to consider this evidence as evidence directly of guilt, that they conclude that the defendant committed those two prior injuries, and as a result they're convinced that he committed the murder with which he was charged, in order to do that, under the instruction in this case, they have to find a clear connection between the prior injuries and the injuries that resulted in the child's death.</text>
            <text>I think that's an important point to emphasize, because the Ninth Circuit consistently has misquoted that instruction, by leaving out the requirement that the connection be clear.</text>
            <text>I do not think due process is... is violated if a defendant's conviction is based upon part on the use of evidence from a jury which... in which they found a clear connection between prior acts and the acts that were specifically charged, so that they can reasonably conclude the defendant must have committed them.</text>
            <text>Now, there is one other possible use that has been suggested, that would be inappropriate for the jury in this particular case, given this instruction.</text>
            <text>And that would be to establish the defendant had some general, criminal disposition that he was just basically a real bad guy.</text>
            <text>And as a result, his character was such that the jury should convict him alone on that evidence has been suggested in one of the amici brief in support of respondent, that reaching that conclusion or an instruction permitting that inference would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text>The problem, however, is that this is not a case in which even if the jury drew an inference of character, it would be drawing an inference of general character or disposition.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dane R. Gillette</label>
            <text>We are using relevance, Your Honor, in the very broad sense that this Court used it in New Jersey v. TLO, in which it suggested that evidence is universally recognized as relevant if it has a tendency to prove any fact of consequence to the action that is being tried.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>If it does have that tendency... and evidence does have that tendency only if there is, in the usual case, a foundation connecting that evidence to this particular defendant.</text>
            <text>Any piece of evidence, I supposed, theoretically can be relevant.</text>
            <text>But it may not, in fact, be relevant in the case because there's nothing tying it to the proposition that you've got to prove, nothing tying it to this defendant.</text>
            <text>And so that's why I asked the question.</text>
            <text>When you say it's got to be relevant, I assume you mean there has got to be a foundation for its... to demonstrate its relevance.</text>

            <text>It wouldn't matter who actually committed the crime.</text>

            <text>Assuming that the battered trial... the evidence you seek to introduce is three prior acts of violence to the child that are provable by medical evidence and you can establish the dates when they took place.</text>
            <text>That would be admissible, as I understand your theory... and I think I agree with you... regardless of whether you tie that to the particular defendant?</text>

            <text>I think it's important to emphasize, as I started to a moment ago, to... to the extent we are talking about disposition evidence in this case and whether it's a demonstration of bad character, this is not a general disposition case.</text>
            <text>And that is why I think that ultimately the argument with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment analysis by the amici is really not necessarily relevant to this case.</text>
            <text>At most, what the evidence of the prior injuries showed was that if there was a linkage, this particular defendant had a disposition or tendency to mistreat this particular victim.</text>
            <text>This was specific disposition evidence.</text>
            <text>It went to the relationship between this defendant and this victim.</text>
            <text>And the California courts have drawn a very clear distinction between that type of specific disposition relating to the relationship between the victim and the defendant, as opposed to some general type of character evidence.</text>

            <text>And the prosecution had to prove that to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text>Now, in addition to the other evidence we've discussed, and the fact that he had sole custody, we also have the confrontation between Mrs. McGuire and the respondent in the emergency room after the child has been brought in.</text>

            <label>Ms. Ann Hardgrove Voris</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>The Ninth Circuit said that the aggregate effect of the admittance of irrelevant, highly prejudicial evidence, compounded by the trial court's instruction to use that evidence in the most prejudicial manner possible, rendered the trial arbitrary and fundamentally unfair.</text>
            <text>Mark McGuire was denied due process of law by the use of the prior injury evidence, coupled with a jury instruction which gave maximum prejudicial effect, rather than a limiting effect.</text>
            <text>The Attorney General has suggested a test which requires that we first look at the relevance and then at the prejudice.</text>
            <text>The first point which I would like to make is that the battered child syndrome evidence... the battered child syndrome could have been proven without the prior injuries, at all.</text>
            <text>The battered child syndrome can be, and Dr. Levine testified, that the battered child syndrome could be proven with the acts which took place which killed the child.</text>
            <text>None the... so, I'm not sure that even on the threshold test of relevance, that this evidence passes the threshold test.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, Ms. Voris, suppose that the trial court had told the jury that they could only consider the evidence of battered child syndrome as tending to show that the child did not die accidentally, and the jury was so instructed, would you still be here arguing that is unconstitutional?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ann_hardgrove_voris">
            <label>Ms. Ann Hardgrove Voris</label>
            <text>I do not believe so.</text>
            <text>In fact, Justice O'Connor, the defendants proposed a jury instruction at the time, which stated that evidence of prior injuries have... has been introduced for the purpose of showing that Tori... Tori McGuire suffered from the battered child syndrome.</text>
            <text>Such evidence, if believed, was not received, and may not be considered by you to prove that defendant is a person of bad character, or that he has a disposition to commit crimes.</text>
            <text>Such evidence was received, and may be considered by you only for the limited purpose of determining if it tends to show the injuries suffered by Tori McGuire, July 7, 1981, were not accidental.</text>
            <text>That was the defendant's proposed jury instruction.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Ms. Voris, why can't you use it to prove... to prove the crime?</text>
            <text>Suppose a child has died from a punctured lung, the lung being punctured by a broken rib.</text>
            <text>And the prosecution introduced evidence... introduces evidence that this defendant has been one of two custodians of a hundred other children over the past 2 years.</text>
            <text>And every one of those other children had broken ribs.</text>
            <text>Are you saying that evidence could not be admitted?</text>

            <text>No, I'm not.</text>
            <text>Under California law, that evidence can be admitted.</text>
            <text>Under Federal law, that evidence can be admitted.</text>

            <text>It is being introduced to show, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is it likely, is it likely that a hundred other children, within the custody of this defendant and one other person, should all have broken ribs, just as this child does?</text>

            <text>It's just one of many pieces of evidence that lead to the conclusion.</text>

            <text>Surely the fact that he was only one of two is something the jury ought to know.</text>

            <text>No, Mr. Chief Justice, my belief is that every single State of the Union, and every... and the Federal system requires that there be an analysis of the evidence prior to its admission.</text>
            <text>And in this case, when the analysis was to be undertaken, the court was told and believed that no analysis was necessary.</text>
            <text>This position is still being taken, that this prior... that battered child syndrome evidence is admissible, without any guidance regarding the characters in terms of similars.</text>
            <text>Now, what happened in this case, was then an instruction was given, which took it from being battered child syndrome evidence to rebut an accident defense, and turned it into similars evidence, by means of a connection made by the instruction... not by the evidence.</text>
            <text>And what happened also is that intent and identity were provided not by evidence in this case, but by this instruction.</text>
            <text>And in so doing, the burden of proof was shifted, and the presumption of innocence was taken away.</text>
            <text>When that happened, fundamental fairness was taken away, and due process was denied.</text>

            <text>The other offenses were not murder, and the other offenses are being used to conclusively tell the jury to... to use the prior injuries to identify him as the perpetrator of the crime in this case.</text>

            <text>And so they had to draw a balance.</text>
            <text>And that the prejudice outweighed the probative value, and therefore a denial of due process.</text>
