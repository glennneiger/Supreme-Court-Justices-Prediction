            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="9.069" offset="127106">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.848" offset="150198">Petitioner, Harold Ray Wade, pleaded guilty to federal charges of drug trafficking and gun possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.631" offset="173290">At his sentencing hearing, Wade argued that the applicable sentencing statute and guideline permitted the District Court to go below the mandatory 10-year sentence for his conviction on the drug charges because after his arrest, he had helped the government catching another drug dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.526" offset="232850">The District Court held that it had no authority to go below the minimum unless the government filed a motion to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.487" offset="256778">Because the government had not filed such a motion, the District Court's sentence weighed to 10 years in prison on the drug charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.223" offset="283736">The Court of Appeals affirmed holding that the District Court had correctly found itself without authority to depart.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.290" offset="307978">The Court of Appeals specifically rejected Wade's argument that the District Court at least had the power to review the government's refusal to file a motion upon a claim that its refusal resulted from an unconstitutional motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.654" offset="361372">We agree with Wade that the District Court has authority to review the government's decision to withhold a substantial assistance motion when a defendant makes a substantial showing that the refusal reflected an unconstitutional motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.322" offset="412050">In this case, however, Wade failed in the District Court to make any showing of unconstitutional motive even though the District Court gave him an adequate opportunity for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.658" offset="445382">We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
