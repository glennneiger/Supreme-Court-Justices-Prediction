            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="9.622" offset="178610">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.474" offset="193970">This Court has stated repeatedly that the starting point for statutory interpretation is the statutory text that Congress enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.381" offset="241618">That admonition has relevance here, even though the question before the Court involves the scope of a judicially implied exception that is not itself to be found in the statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.577" offset="306401">The comprehensiveness and unqualified nature of the prohibitions of restraints of trade and of unfair methods of competition that are in the text nonetheless have much to say about the proper resolution of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.990" offset="392083">In the Parker against Brown line of decisions, this Court has held that those Federal statutory prohibitions of commercial conduct should not be interpreted to apply to the activities of the States themselves and derivatively to private conduct that implements the States' regulatory policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.593" offset="506499">Now, the basic error of the court of appeals in this case as we see it is that in its concern to give generous scope to this implied exemption, in its concern to give the exemption ample elbow room, it gave the exemption a penumbrile expanse that cuts into the quick of the statutory restraints on private conduct that Congress did enact, the statutory commands that embody what this Court has described as our national policy in favor of competition, and most emphatically in favor of price competition among horizontal competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.693" offset="710881">Contrary to the court of appeals approach, this Court's decisions have made clear that primacy is to be given to the statutory command and that the scope of the implied exemption is limited by the exemption's purposes and is to be delimited so as to preserve the effectiveness of Congress's prohibition of privately imposed trade restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.997" offset="848076">This is the jurisprudential perspective we see reflected in the rigorous two-prong test for exemption of private conduct that this Court unanimously adopted in the Midcal Aluminum case and that the Court has elaborated in subsequent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.897" offset="947655">The first prong of that test, that there must be a clearly articulated State policy, is not at issue in this case as it reaches this Court, but the reasons why that prong alone does not suffice to exempt private conduct are illuminating in considering the function that the second prong must play, because if merely a clearly articulated State policy that private conduct would be exempt from the antitrust laws would suffice, the States would in effect be given the power to repeal the Sherman Act and the other antitrust laws industry by industry as they choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.453" offset="1189967">And in Parker against Brown itself the Court recognized that that cannot be the case under our constitutional system and under the supremacy clause, and said that a State does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate or by declaring that their action is lawful, something that the Court quoted again just a year or so ago in the Omni case.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.674" offset="1318803">So the second prong is of crucial importance here, and the second prong as it was formulated and as it's been repeated every time, says that the conduct must be actively supervised by the State itself, and every time the Court has formulated this prong it has used the modifier actively.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.741" offset="1731120">It is whether there has been review and approval by State officials of the proposed rates, and we mean approval of the substance of the restraints.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.712" offset="1862986">Professors Areeda and Turner in their analysis came to the conclusion that the negative option approach really cannot suffice as an adequate method of State supervision.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.555" offset="1926307">We think that there can be a showing that the option was exercised in a way that showed that the State officials did in fact approve the policies and... except that they were reviewed, and that the State can manifest its approval in any way it sees fit, including a failure to disapprove, as long as there is assurance that the State has reviewed and approved the restraint, the particular restraint as consistent with the State's regulatory policies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.910" offset="7499792">Those essentially set out and the States defined what they meant by all those concepts what I think the State was worried about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.497" offset="7530094">They wanted the rates not to be excessive because they wanted consumers to have reasonable rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1856.353" offset="7565516">These are insurance companies, and the States wanted to be sure that a policyholder, when it comes time to make a claim, has someone to make a claim against, and lastly they worry about discriminatory practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="2772.173" offset="11228824">We submit that the type of qualitative analysis which permeates the Federal Trade Commission's decision below is an inappropriate standard for active supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.385" offset="11309595">Both the Third Circuit and the First Circuit in the New England Motor Carriers case criticize the Federal Trade Commission for insisting on sitting in judgment of the strictness or effectiveness of what these States did which became in effect an overly intrusive... an intrusion into the prerogatives of these States to regulate as they see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.404" offset="11417742">We think that their decision is consistent with this Court's precedent, which has evidenced a determination to give the States some breathing room to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.878" offset="11467583">In Southern Motor Carriers the Court held that the Sherman Act was not designed to compromise a State's ability to regulate, and rejected a compulsion requirement for Midcal's prong one test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.769" offset="11523172">In Town of Hallie, the Court also rejected an intense inquiry into legislative intent as undermining the policies of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.327" offset="11565386">In the most recent State-actioned opinion, the Omni case, decided by this Court last term, the Court rejected an inquiry into whether the municipal regulation of billboards was in some way procedurally or substantively defective or deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.622" offset="11634558">The Court also rejected a conspiracy exception to State action, suggesting that the probing into the intent of a regulator was anathema to the federalism principles that underlie State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.981" offset="11700073">Several of the members of the Court, in questioning Mr. Wallace, have expressed concern about the problems which private parties would face if the Federal Trade Commission's analysis of active supervision became the law, and indeed we submit that would be a practical problem which would cause the withdrawal of companies from otherwise accepting this kind of option just as it caused these companies to withdraw from the rating bureaus in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.910" offset="11875720">Mr. Wallace suggests that to meet the commission's affirmative determination test, all a company would have to do would be to in effect communicate with an insurance department or in some other fashion endeavor to evaluate ahead of the fact what they might do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.372" offset="11945624">I submit that however cautiously and carefully a company considering entering into a rating bureau and joining in a collective filing might be, there just is no way to assure that ultimately, whatever commentary is received in advance, the department will act in a way which might satisfy the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.606" offset="12050532">Any test, we submit, that leaves for later judicial assessment the quality of what a regulator has done defies predictability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.175" offset="13316844">What I would concede, as many of our amici have very forcefully argued, that any test that goes beyond looking to the statutory structure of regulation runs some risk of lapsing into some sort of qualitative analysis of what is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.470" offset="13386016">I also concede that it lessens the possibility of certainty or predictability for private parties considering whether to accept an option which the State has provided for them.</text>
