            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="137996">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-42, United States v. Therese A. Burke.</text>

            <text syncTime="9.956" offset="177807">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.224" offset="190868">The issue in this case is whether a taxpayer must include in her gross income amounts received in settlement of a title VII wage disparity suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.080" offset="226290">We submit the settlement award is gross income because it amounts simply to delayed payment of wages for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.067" offset="254189">Those wages should be taxed in the same manner as if they had been paid when earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.054" offset="270176">The facts of this case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.423" offset="279684">The taxpayers were female employees of the Tennessee Valley Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.375" offset="295462">In 1984, the TVA was sued under title VII on the theory that it had increased the salaries of employees in certain male-dominated pay schedules without providing comparable increases to employees in certain female-dominated pay schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.468" offset="355857">The complaint sought specific relief in the form of an order directing TVA to eliminate prospectively the pay disparity and to provide, quote, back pay to all affected female employees in an amount sufficient to eliminate discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.977" offset="413849">In 1987, the plaintiffs and TVA settled the lawsuit by entering into a settlement agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.731" offset="436837">The taxpayers in this case shared in the settlement proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.016" offset="450003">TVA made payments to them, and in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement, withheld amounts for Social Security and Federal income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.420" offset="479573">The taxpayers then filed claims for refund of the withheld taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.558" offset="500158">The Internal Revenue Service disallowed those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.343" offset="511338">The taxpayers then brought this refund suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.395" offset="523563">They argue that the settlement payments should be excluded from gross income under section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, which states that gross income does not include, quote, the amount of any damages received on account of personal injuries or sickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.904" offset="581555">The district court rejected their claim; however, the court of appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.208" offset="598796">The majority reasoned that title VII awards constitute damages on account of personal injuries or sickness because injuries resulting from discrimination are, quote, injuries to the individual rights and dignity of the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.866" offset="649369">Judge Wellford dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.733" offset="656892">He concluded that title VII awards should be included in gross income because they simply amount to a payment of wages for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.705" offset="688762">We submit that Judge Wellford is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.824" offset="701196">An equitable award of back pay is compensation for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.442" offset="715720">The Court recognized that principle in Social Security Board v. Nierotko, where it held that a back pay award under the National Labor Relations Act is subject to Social Security taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.416" offset="755635">As the Court stated there, surely the back pay is remuneration.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.118" offset="770368">The same is true with respect to title VII back pay, which was patterned after the NLRA remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.689" offset="792729">Thus, the taxpayers back--</text>

            <text syncTime="181.184" offset="862633">But this was the very issue that was involved in Nierotko, actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.850" offset="873395">That was an unlawful discharge case also.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.986" offset="881859">And in Nierotko, the Court held that the person remained in the service of the employee where he had been wrongfully discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.492" offset="911952">The Court stated that services are... that one remains to provide services even though one might not be active.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.846" offset="945284">Of course... I mean, you can say he remained in, quote, in the service of the employer, but did not provide any services.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.268" offset="975064">But that was the issue that this Court faced in Nierotko and decided that in fact those were wages for services.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.063" offset="1050192">That is the very distinction we draw between personal injuries and wages for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.950" offset="1069732">That where a person is unable to perform the service, that he has been disabled, in those cases he's receiving damages by the amount of the lost wages.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.916" offset="1185611">I don't believe that the IRS has had an opportunity to formulate a formal position on that, but I think the same principles would be applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.821" offset="1209225">We would look to whether there has been what amounts to a capital loss of some kind for the... on behalf of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.241" offset="1234930">If the employee, for instance, suffered emotional injury, that is a type of injury that is recognized by the Service as being within the 104(a)(2) exclusion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="294.935" offset="1317686">It doesn't read that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.585" offset="1324269">It says the phrase damages received means an amount received through prosecution of a legal suit based on tort or tort-type rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.609" offset="1364393">And I think that that regulation is referring specifically to what we mean by the term damages received.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.227" offset="1386858">It's not speaking to what we mean by a personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.179" offset="1398665">And I think the important distinction that that regulation is making... which, by the way, appears on page 12 of our reply brief... the important distinction that that regulation is making is between a damage remedy and a remedy for equitable relief, for specific relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.438" offset="1459687">It says the term damages received means an amount received through prosecution of a legal suit or action based on tort or tort-type rights.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="339.294" offset="1495109">Well, why isn't a suit brought, as in this case under title VII, a suit for damages based on a tort-type right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="348.400" offset="1531576">Because instead, Your Honor, that is a suit for equitable relief, for specific relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.554" offset="1552161">What title VII provides is an equitable remedy for specific relief in the form of reinstatement and an additional award of back pay.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="362.410" offset="1587583">Can't you get damages as a form of relief?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="365.043" offset="1598136">This... I would look to the same distinction that this Court drew in Bowen v. Massachusetts between... the term damages and the term specific relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.300" offset="1635126">Damages are provided as a monetary substitute for a loss, while specific relief is provided as the very thing to which the plaintiff is entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.156" offset="1670548">And in fact, in Bowen, the majority opinion used the back pay award as an example of that type of specific relief where a monetary award is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.845" offset="1709314">Now as I was saying, the taxpayers' back pay award in this case falls squarely within the Internal Revenue Code's definition of income, which expressly includes compensation for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.486" offset="1763857">And the only question then is whether some other provision of the code nevertheless removes back pay from that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.573" offset="1788203">As a starting point, we note that this Court has repeatedly stated that exclusions from income must be express and not implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.912" offset="1817565">And this Court has repeatedly emphasized that even express exclusion should be construed with restraint in light of Congress's policy to tax comprehensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.982" offset="1849852">Now there is no express exclusion for title VII back pay awards, and we believe that the court of appears erred in construing section 104(a)(2) as providing that kind of exclusion.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="438.790" offset="1893111">So, Mr. Minear, if Congress in enacting title VII had provided for damages for this sort of discrimination and allowed a jury trial so that Albemarle would have come out the other way, then this award would be excluded?</text>

            <text syncTime="455.300" offset="1959149">That only passes the first hurdle here.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.183" offset="1966672">The question in front must first be damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.168" offset="1974613">And it also must be received as compensation for personal injuries or sickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.406" offset="1995616">So there still would have to be a determination whether the damages were received as compensation for personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.060" offset="2022156">And that would be the remaining question.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.178" offset="2034695">And that would depend on the gravamen of the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.402" offset="2075550">Why did the Government abandon its original interpretation of that in which personal injuries would mean physical injuries?</text>
            <text syncTime="495.175" offset="2118600">I mean, when you say personal injuries or sickness, it seems to me... the phrase feet or inches, you wouldn't think that feet referred to a part of the human anatomy, given the word feet as used with inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.483" offset="2171890">And when you say personal injuries or sickness, I mean, it obviously connotes to me physical injuries.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.480" offset="2271887">It becomes even stronger when one looks to the original language of the 1918 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.516" offset="2292053">And in 1920, based on that language, the IRS took the position that personal injuries meant physical injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.037" offset="2322042">However, that same year, this Court decided the case of Eisner v. Macomber, and that indicated, at least suggested, that income for purposes of the Sixteenth Amendment referred only to gains from labor or capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.429" offset="2375645">The IRS, looking at that definition, reconsidered this question, and it said, well, regardless of what what is now section 104(a)(2) might say, this wouldn't be income in any regard because a damage award is not a gain from labor or capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.307" offset="2439175">That is the approach that continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.093" offset="2450355">In other words, that the exclusion here just became irrelevant, based on the Service's view of the meaning of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.162" offset="2478567">That question was finally resolved in 1955, when this Court decided Glenshaw Glass, and made clear that income includes all accessions to wealth.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.669" offset="2616598">It also arose in a tax court case in 1972 called Say v. Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.221" offset="2638855">Now perhaps the IRS made the mistake of not pressing that argument further and continuing to draw the line between physical injuries and other types of injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.345" offset="2679292">However, by that time there had been this accumulation of practice, you know, from the... as a result of the original Eisner decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.785" offset="3073114">The question in Threlkeld, it was attempting to deal with a difficulty that had originally arisen in the Roemer tax court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.041" offset="3102058">And in Roemer the tax court had tried to make a distinction between personal reputation and business reputation, saying that one could get an exclusion for injuries to one's personal reputation, but not to one's business reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.281" offset="3151064">And what Threlkeld did, and I think quite correctly, was eliminate that distinction and said no, we simply look to the fact that there was an injury to one's reputation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1034.614" offset="4276419">Now the ordinary meaning of the term personal injuries or sickness does not embrace, as the court of appeals would have it, I think, every legally cognizable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.803" offset="4313199">And that is the reductio ad absurdum of their position, that every injury would in fact be covered... every legally cognizable injury to an individual would be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.993" offset="4349875">As various courts and commentators have observed, the term personal injury has a more limited meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.480" offset="4371818">And as a result of various tax court rulings, the Internal Revenue Service has applied the term to certain analogous nonphysical injuries, primarily injury to one's reputation and injury to one's emotional well-being, that, like physical injuries, can be roughly related to a loss of human capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.358" offset="4443394">We think it's clear, however, that the taxpayers here did not receive that kind of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.310" offset="4463142">The resulting settlement agreement here provided for specific relief in the form of certain affirmative action and also back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.499" offset="4491981">And the monetary award... the monetary portion of that award clearly compensates wages for services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.320" offset="4519253">Now, the Government's position here is not only reasonable, it also consistent with prevailing law and produces a just result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.240" offset="4546943">As I noted earlier, this Court has already concluded in Nierotko that a back pay award is a payment of wages for purposes of FICA taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.080" offset="4574215">There would be... there is no reason to depart from that rule in the case of Federal income taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.548" offset="4592187">Additionally, the IRS has consistently treated back pay awards under other statutes, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, as gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.070" offset="4622176">We simply urge that a title VII back pay award be treated in the same manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.839" offset="4637327">And to hold otherwise would produce anomalous results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.791" offset="4649134">If earnings received through a back pay award had been paid when earned, they certainly would have been subject to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.278" offset="4671077">There's no reason why the earnings should now become tax exempt simply because they are paid at a later date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.932" offset="4689676">Indeed, if the court of appeals's approach were followed, the Federal Government would end up subsidizing discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.634" offset="4712455">An employer could engage in wage discrimination, and if sued under title VII, make up the difference in wages through a back pay award based on after tax earning, which would make the employee whole... whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.823" offset="4757281">And it could then pocket the taxes that should have been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.125" offset="4770447">And we do not believe that Congress intended to provide that sort of tax reward or incentive for unlawful discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1179.723" offset="4856860">I detected at the outset a really... misstatement of the question presented that has veered from what I thought we addressed in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.763" offset="4896984">Counsel for the Solicitor General and for the Government talked about it as a accession to wealth or gross income case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.852" offset="4929376">We all agree that it would be an accession to wealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.721" offset="4940869">This is a question of exclusion by section 104(a)(2) from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.140" offset="4970545">It's an exclusion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.326" offset="4975247">And to reach the exclusion case, we have to look at the statute, and that's where this case begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.265" offset="5014953">And the regulation that follows thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.817" offset="5025193">And the statute says in language that one may think clear until we start bouncing it around, but the statute says, excluding the amount... the amount... of any damages received on account of personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.398" offset="5107531">Now, a regulation follows--</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph E. Finley</label>
            <text syncTime="1246.800" offset="5125189">--Yes, but sickness wasn't involved in this case, and I'm trying to confine it to this case and the scope of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.236" offset="5146923">Now, the regulation comes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.990" offset="5165940">It's the Government's regulation, not ours, a regulation which we are entitled to follow and entitled to honor because the regulation is in accord with the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.698" offset="5208781">And the regulation helps to expound and expand what is excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.602" offset="5236367">And 26 CFR 1-104-1(c) excludes the amount of any damages received on account of personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.208" offset="5274819">Then it goes further to make an express definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.492" offset="5287880">The term damages received means an amount received... we're not talking about legal or equitable; it's an amount received... through prosecution of a legal suit or action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.686" offset="5348693">Through prosecution of an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.204" offset="5354754">In this case, the underlying case was an action brought in court to redress the wrong of sexual discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.494" offset="5391952">And it says, through prosecution of a legal suit or action based upon a tort or tort-type rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.618" offset="5436465">And we suggest and argue and present that the inquiry must be focused on those terms, used by Congress, and used by the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.657" offset="5476589">And the facts of this case fit exactly into the statutory language and the regulation, point by point, step by step.</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.173" offset="5562688">And they're not relying for their point in this case upon the word damages, although the D.C. Circuit in a recent case did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.682" offset="5624651">--Well, if they are relying on personal injuries, and I struggle to determine what their position really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.621" offset="5660386">In the reply brief, the Government says that we can't establish that a personal injury was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.256" offset="5682956">Now, it seems to me the analogy may be drawn readily from this Court's ruling in Goodman v. Lukens Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.095" offset="5718274">And this poses a hypothetical to which I don't believe the Government has an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.499" offset="5739903">And in fact, its whole argument treats Goodman v. Lukens Steel as it never existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.670" offset="5760592">In Goodman v. Lukens Steel, there was a combined section 1981 case and a title VII case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.656" offset="5792566">It was the same wrong, the same injury complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.858" offset="5805418">The case proceeded under section 1981 through the district court and the court of appeals because obviously there was a wider, broader remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.749" offset="5844915">Now this Court has held, and it's undisputed, that in section 1981 claims and title VII claims, the gravamen of the injury is the same, the proof required is the same, the treatment is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.307" offset="5899145">And the bottom line is that the only difference in those statutes in application in a practical world is the actual remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.913" offset="5929552">Now, this Court earlier said in Davis v. Passman that you must separate the wrong from the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.852" offset="5969363">And that's what we believe clearly, clearly the statute provides and the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.089" offset="5990260">Now to answer your question further, Justice Scalia, and go back to the 1981 analogy, in our particular case... let's take that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.362" offset="6023384">If the taxpayers in this case had been black persons instead of females, they could have brought the same action under section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.468" offset="6067792">The same wrong would be complained of, the same proof would have been necessary, and the result... let's say the outcome or the settlement was based... same dollars, same everything else, except this is under section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.810" offset="6121186">So the question becomes if a violation of section 1981 is a personal injury, there... and it's also a part of title VII, discrimination is a personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.785" offset="6169043">And this Court in Goodman made a ringing affirmation that discrimination is a personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.307" offset="6203211">And it cannot be said otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.507" offset="6211988">And I can't understand the Government saying otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.009" offset="6222019">And so the Government has not unequivocally answered the question, was a... is a violation of title VII a personal injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.054" offset="10854156">Employers in this country need to have the question resolved because they will be caused to expend far more monies if these proceeds are taxable, and the need to settle these cases, which Congress has specifically addressed itself to, will be greatly furthered by the fact that if these proceeds are not taxable, cases will be easier and more readily resolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.782" offset="11129069">And I hope to conclude by and wish to conclude by again referring to the basics of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.471" offset="11159789">The facts of this case fit the statute and the regulation hand in glove, which entitles the taxpayers here to be exempt under the statute.</text>
