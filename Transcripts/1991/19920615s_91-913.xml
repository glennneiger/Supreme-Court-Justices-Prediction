            <text syncTime="7.200" offset="119587">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.992" offset="138813">The respondent, Shumate, was a participant in his employer's pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.200" offset="159606">It contained the antialienation provision that is required for a plan's qualification under the 1974 statute we call ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.914" offset="202447">The District Court rejected his contention that his interest in the plan should be excluded from his bankruptcy estate under a section of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.372" offset="248318">That provision excludes property that is subject to a restriction on transfer enforceable under "applicable non-bankruptcy law".</text>
            <text syncTime="50.573" offset="293144">The Trial Court held that the latter phrase embraced only state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.248" offset="311743">The Court of Appeals reversed and ruled that the interest should be excluded from the bankruptcy estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.328" offset="336090">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm that judgment by a unanimous vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.506" offset="356779">The plain language of the Bankruptcy Code and ERISA establishes that an antialienation provision in a qualified pension plan constitutes a restriction on transfer enforceable under applicable non-bankruptcy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.445" offset="420622">Justice Scalia, while joining the opinion of the Court, has filed a separate concurring statement.</text>
