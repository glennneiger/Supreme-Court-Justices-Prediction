            <text syncTime="59.103" offset="378694">The case before the Court today in this case relates to the definition of punitive damages as that term is used in the Federal Tort Claim Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.041" offset="418400">The basic structure of the Federal Tort Claim Act is premised on three features.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.612" offset="440761">The first is that in these cases the United States is to be treated as would a private individual if it were a defendant in a tort claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.234" offset="479213">The second feature is that the law of the State where the tort occurred is to be applied, and the third feature is that certain exceptions are engrafted in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.609" offset="524771">One of those exceptions, namely the punitive damage exception, is the one that the Court is concerned with today.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.513" offset="548385">It is our position that if the Government's definition of punitive damages is to be accepted as it was by the Seventh Circuit and the Fourth Circuit, it would emasculate the objectives of the Federal Tort Claim Act, because it would result in the Government not being treated as would an individual citizen if the individual citizen were the defendant, and that's the--</text>

            <text syncTime="157.063" offset="770531">That's correct, but I... but I believe the Federal interpretation should bear in mind the other objectives of the act, one of which is to treat the Government as an individual citizen would be treated if it were a defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.525" offset="832389">I mean, you treat the Government as an individual citizen except with respect to punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.679" offset="857048">I mean, it seems to me you're sort of begging the question when you say you have to treat the Government the same way you treat everybody else.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Rottier</label>
            <text syncTime="187.416" offset="891948">The approach I would suggest is the one used by the this Court in the Neustadt case, where the issue was how to define misrepresentation, since that is also an excluded basis of liability for the Government, and there what the Court did was to look at the commonly accepted definition of misrepresentation as it existed at the time the Federal Tort Claim Act was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.197" offset="983063">I would suggest that this Court should do the same thing with respect to punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.201" offset="1003125">And what I believe the Court would find is there was general consensus among the writers and among the courts as to what punitive damages are, and the definition, for example, that was used by this Court in the Milwaukee railroad case going back to 1875 focuses on the nature of the conduct of the defendant as opposed to the effect of the receipt of the damages by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.800" offset="1105525">I think that's where the Flannery court and the Molzof court deviated from an appropriate approach to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.537" offset="1136454">They focused on the effect of the receipt of the award on the plaintiff, as opposed to focusing on the basis of imposing the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.226" offset="1175220">In this case, one might ask this question: would Mr. Molzof have been entitled to future medical expenses if the defendant were a private hospital instead of a veterans' hospital?</text>
            <text syncTime="269.534" offset="1220464">The answer is absolutely clear, under Wisconsin law, that, yes, he would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.605" offset="1240735">And then, to remain in keeping with the... one of the objectives of the act, the Government should be treated the same, unless... unless the basis for awarding these is the basis on which punitive damages are normally awarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.197" offset="1303115">What principle of Wisconsin law is it that leads you to answer that question the way you did?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Rottier</label>
            <text syncTime="295.149" offset="1322864">Under traditional Wisconsin common law in tort cases, if a plaintiff can show that the negligence of a defendant was a substantial factor contributing to the need for future medical expenses, those are awardable.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.159" offset="1378870">In some instances, they're subrogated to someone who has paid them.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.563" offset="1400500">That much is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.563" offset="1404575">In this case, for example, this entire problem that's presented could easily be remedied by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.001" offset="1434250">If Congress had approached the Federal Tort Claims Act as strictly a compensation act and defined what elements of compensation were to be included, it would be much more easily applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.559" offset="1484509">Or, if it wanted to avoid this type of situation, it could have enacted a set-off procedure, just as it did for disability benefits under 38 U.S.C. 351... and the Court I am sure is familiar with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.300" offset="1539471">If, for example, a veteran is malpracticed upon and it causes an increase in disability benefits, the Government, pursuant to section 351, suspends payment of the previously enacted and previously ordered disability payments so that a double payment does not result.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.511" offset="1620346">That is what two of the circuits have recommended to Congress over the years, in the Feeley case in 1964 and in the Ulrich case.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.485" offset="1660261">In both of those instances... those are the only two circuit cases before Molzof where this particular issue was presented... both of those circuits said that they were uncomfortable with the potential of a double recovery, but that the resolution of that problem was for Congress, not for the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.886" offset="1773842">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.421" offset="1780007">If, for example... and I think it is... this problem can be dealt with through State law, if for example a... under State law a particular type of compensatory damage is deemed to be excessive, then it can be... then it is certainly not awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.966" offset="1850119">In... if we took Flannery, for example, which gave rise to this discussion generally, where you had a comatose individual, where $ 1, 300, 000 was awarded for that, the Federal court could merely have addressed that issue on the basis of excessiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.809" offset="1913545">If it thought... if the circuit court, the court of appeals, felt that under the State law such damages were awardable, it could have diminished them on the basis of excessiveness.</text>

            <text syncTime="482.951" offset="2074041">You said, if this individual had been in a private hospital rather than a Government hospital, it's perfectly clear that under Wisconsin law there would have been a recovery for the lost medical expenses, the large amount in dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.478" offset="4752219">It's based on... it has not been defined... punitive damages have not been defined by this Court as those which are not compensatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1191.852" offset="4909685">Essentially, Judge Shabaz... and you may recall at the end of his decision from the bench, I asked him if he were giving... granting the equivalent of a permanent injunction against the Veterans Administration to provide the same level of care, and he said that the Court would retain jurisdiction and would monitor the situation and be available for interim relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.201" offset="4999128">The Court went on, however, to find that there were deficiencies in the Veterans Administration care and awarded $ 25, 000 a year so that the family could bring in an outside physician, outside physical therapists, outside respiratory therapists, and supplement the care in the respects in which it was deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.615" offset="5076764">That is an unworkable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.567" offset="5088571">Essentially what he said is, all future damages for medical care, other than $ 25, 000 a year, are noncompensatory and thus punitive, but he conceded that at least to the extent of $ 25, 000, compensatory damages were justifiable.</text>

          <turn speaker="daniel_a_rottier" startTime="2967.505" stopTime="3152.292">
            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Rottier</label>
            <text syncTime="2967.505" offset="12012274">Mr. Chief Justice and the Court, there was proof at the trial level that three other hospitals, including the hospital in the home town of Mrs. Molzof... Boscobel, Wisconsin... would take this... the injured veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.496" offset="12068281">Moreover, the suggestion that Mrs. Molzof should have taken him from the Veterans Hospital before the case was tried to evidence her intent overlooks the fact the cost of care is approximately $ 400, 000 per year, and there was testimony she had limited resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.525" offset="12132438">So that should not be the determinative factor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.810" offset="12145499">To respond to a couple of the issues raised with Justice Kennedy, I think under the New York regime the only difference between damages for a fully comatose individual versus someone who had died would be the future cost of care, which obviously wouldn't be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.288" offset="12219478">The impairment of future earning capacity would likely be the same, I would expect, under the McDougald approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.961" offset="12246122">The attorney for the Government came very close to agreeing that they were not objecting to paying the money, but they were objecting to the continuation of free medical care under Mr. Molzof's entitlement as a disabled veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.821" offset="12313518">I suggest there is a very easy solution to that, and this is the wrong branch of Government for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.057" offset="12338491">It merely... it can come from the Veterans Administration; it can come from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.694" offset="12357091">They merely suspend eligibility for the underlying benefits and require the veteran to expend the dollars which have been awarded at his or her choice, whether in a private facility or whether in a Government facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.454" offset="12416127">But in either case they will be expended, and the purpose of the act will be complied with, and that is the much cleaner approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.144" offset="12446847">Each time you try to focus on whether the effect of receipt of compensatory damages is punitive or not, you get deeper and deeper in the quagmire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.166" offset="12486971">It's much easier to step back and say, what is the justification for punitive damages?</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.486" offset="12508183">If the justification is to punish, and it's based on the nature of the conduct, then it is not awardable because it falls within the prohibition of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.394" offset="12555830">I might mention in response to Justice Souter's questions about conscious pain and suffering and such, the state of the law in Wisconsin is that conscious pain and suffering is compensable, but not... there is no such entity as unconscious pain and suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.423" offset="12623958">Loss of enjoyment of life is viewed as a component of pain and suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.291" offset="12639422">The narrow issue that's undecided in Wisconsin is whether a comatose individual who cannot exhibit an awareness of loss of enjoyment of life should be compensated for that component.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.948" offset="12690100">There was no effort made in this case to seek an award for conscious pain and suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.936" offset="12710057">We took the position that we did not have the evidence to support that, and it was not available under Wisconsin law, even though some States might in fact have allowed that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.313" offset="12879540">I agree with the Government's counsel that the basic approach of both the trial judge and the Seventh Circuit was that both of these components of damages resulted in the punitive effect and therefore was prohibited by the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.923" offset="12933979">In closing, I would draw your attention to the Massachusetts Bonding case which did relate to the Federal Tort Claims Act and did require the Supreme Court to look at the definition of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.265" offset="12995314">That involved a Massachusetts wrongful death statute which said that if someone was killed their survivors could make a claim for wrongful death, but it had to fall within a certain minimum and maximum irrespective of what pecuniary damages had been sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="3264.310" offset="13199487">"By definition, punitive damages are based upon the degree of the defendant's culpability. "</text>
