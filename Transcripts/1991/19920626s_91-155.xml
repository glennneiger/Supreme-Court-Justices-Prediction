            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90931">The next two cases are related.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.865" offset="106291">They are a petition and a cross-petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.862" offset="126353">One of them, I am announcing on behalf of the Chief Justice who was unable to here this morning for the announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.987" offset="162820">These cases come to us on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.065" offset="187166">The respondent in International Society for Krishna Consciousness against Lee, and Lee against the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.519" offset="236903">The respondent operates three major airports in the New York City area.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.931" offset="258637">It adapted a regulation banning the repetitive solicitation of money within its terminals while allowing such solicitation on the sidewalks outside the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.877" offset="302418">The petitioner is a not-for-profit religious corporation whose members solicit funds in public places to support their movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.580" offset="337213">It brought suit claiming that the regulation banning solicitation activities deprive them of their rights under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.383" offset="372427">In an opinion authored by the Chief Justice, we hold that the airport terminals are not public fora.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.726" offset="401788">Historically, airports have not been made available as locations for speech activity, nor has the respondent in this case voluntarily opened the terminals to solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.126" offset="447346">To survive review, therefore, the solicitation ban need only be shown to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.838" offset="474200">The solicitation ban satisfies this test as it is a reasonable means of attacking the risks of duress, fraud, and congestion that attend personal solicitation for funds in airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.709" offset="525713">In a separate per curium opinion, dealing with the related challenge to respondent's ban on leafleting activity within the terminals, we strike down the port authority's regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.894" offset="594467">I have filed a separate concurring opinion; Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which he is joined in part by Justices Blackmun, Stevens, and Souter; Justice Souter has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justices Blackmun and Stevens joined; Chief Justice Rehnquist has delivered a second opinion dissenting in part in which Justices White, Scalia, and Thomas joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.293" offset="720064">Now, if anyone can figure that out, they are doing well.</text>
