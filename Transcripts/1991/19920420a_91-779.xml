            <text syncTime="47.291" offset="333793">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="50.894" offset="348212">The issue in this case is whether Montana's venue law violates the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.759" offset="375693">That venue law provides that a domestic corporation can be sued only in the county in which it has its principle place of business or in a case where a tort occurred within the State in the county where the tort occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.810" offset="431804">The same venue law provides that suit can be filed against any foreign corporation in any of the 56 counties in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.086" offset="469002">This rule applies even to a foreign corporation that has been licensed to do business, has named a registered agent, and has established a place of business in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.146" offset="513202">Burlington Northern is this latter type of corporation, and the reason that we're before this Court today is that application of the Montana venue law has led to these suits and a number of others being filed in two particular counties in Montana in which suit would not be proper if the suit were against a domestic corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.919" offset="596271">Now, I want to emphasize at the outset that petitioners are not asking this Court to determine what kind of venue law any State should prescribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.274" offset="633678">That is strictly a matter for the State, and they are entitled to make it as narrow or as broad as they choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.378" offset="662099">Our position is simply this: that a foreign corporation that has been admitted to do business in the State and has named its registered agent and established a place of business there is entitled to the protection of the same venue laws that the State chooses to adopt for its domestic incorporations.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.610" offset="839105">That is our position, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.354" offset="850077">We believe that that basic issue was decided by this Court 60 years ago in the case of Power Manufacturing Company v. Saunders, and there are two points that I want to particularly emphasize in the argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.631" offset="903157">First, that the Saunders law was squarely based upon the reality of the substantial similarities between a domestic corporation and a corporation that, although incorporated in another State, has been what this Court called domesticated in Wheeling v. Lander.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="211.336" stopTime="217.761">
            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="211.336" offset="989988">Saunders was substantially criticized and limited very shortly after it was decided, wasn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="betty_jo_christian" startTime="217.761" stopTime="364.006">
            <label>Ms. Betty Jo Christian</label>
            <text syncTime="217.761" offset="1015693">The only criticism of Saunders that I'm aware of, Justice Rehnquist, occurred in the Starnes decision in a footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.865" offset="1048085">Starnes had decided, in the context of a Texas venue law in which geographic discrimination was not at issue that in that particular case there was in fact no discrimination at all in practice between the foreign and domestic corporation, and in a footnote in Justice Brennan's opinion he simply stated, citing three decisions of this Court, that it is not clear whether Saunders is still good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.325" offset="1157904">But when those three decisions are analyzed, one of them... Metropolitan Life Insurance Company against Brownell... actually cited Saunders and quoted from it as establishing the standard that should be applied, and simply went on to find that in that case, because of the different statutory schemes that the State had enacted related to foreign and domestic insurance companies, there was a rational basis for the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.694" offset="1263438">The second case was the Bain Peanut Company case authored by Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.859" offset="1284023">In that case, the Court held that a venue law which established venue for a corporation of any type, domestic or foreign, in any county in which a cause of action arose, was constitutional although a suit could be brought against an individual only in the county of Donethal, and the point there was simply that there's sufficient difference between a corporation and an individual to justify the different treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.069" offset="1404917">We have no quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.120" offset="1409097">The third case cited was the Allied Stores case in which the Court was concerned with a State statute that provided a more favorable treatment for a foreign corporation than a domestic corporation and thus did not involve the issues of disparate treatment for one who is essentially an outsider to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.857" offset="1500003">So we do not think that those cases in any way undermine Saunders.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.212" offset="1521424">In fact, to the contrary, Saunders was actually the first in a line of cases that has established a broad principle regarding the equality of treatment to which a domestic corporation and foreign corporations in this domesticated class are entitled.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.006" offset="1600627">Ms. Christian, if you win this case, is it sufficient for us to decree that Montana must... in effect the Montana courts must allow domestic corporations to be tried in any county?</text>

            <label>Ms. Betty Jo Christian</label>
            <text syncTime="377.624" offset="1655066">--I think that the equal protection simply demands that foreign corporations that have been admitted to do business and in fact have a place of business in the State be treated equally with domestic corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.095" offset="1724970">Now, the State legislature could choose to equalize this in any way that they see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.032" offset="1748793">We think as a practical matter that a State legislature is unlikely to ever adopt an any-county rule if it has to be applied to domestic corporations.</text>

            <label>Ms. Betty Jo Christian</label>
            <text syncTime="411.728" offset="1791530">I think the answer would be to determine that the equal protection clause requires that foreign corporations of this class be given equal treatment with domestic corporations and remand to the Montana supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.258" offset="1857672">Under the existing law, the Montana supreme court has decreed that a domestic corporation resides wherever it has its principal place of business in the State, and so the equality would appear to be one of permitting the foreign corporation that is also operating a place of business in the State to have venue only at its principal place of business in the State, but I would reiterate that ultimately the decision is for the State legislature and for the State courts, and that the equalization that is required is simply equal treatment for the foreign corporation and the domestic corporation.</text>

            <label>Justice Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="470.946" offset="2028408">But you think it would be open to the Montana supreme court to provide the, as it were, the more favorable alternative relief that in effect would get you out of this county.</text>

            <label>Ms. Betty Jo Christian</label>
            <text syncTime="480.503" offset="2066651">We think that it would, and we think in fact that if... to do anything else would require that they overrule their own prior decisions, holding that the residence of a domestic corporation is its principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.346" offset="2134047">It might be illuminating, Justice Souter, if we look briefly at how this disparity arose, because it doesn't arise directly from the statute itself.</text>

            <label>Justice Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="507.320" offset="2173858">I think maybe if I may interrupt you again, maybe that's in part what was provoking my question, and I may simply be wrong about the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.577" offset="2202906">I thought the Montana statute... well, Montana had a statute in which the domestic corporation simply had the power to designate its principle place of business and that that was binding for venue purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.858" offset="2256091">Am I wrong on that?</text>

            <label>Ms. Betty Jo Christian</label>
            <text syncTime="528.729" offset="2259539">It does not appear to be that, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.711" offset="2271451">The statute talks about residence and nonresidence, and the Montana supreme court decreed that a domestic corporation resides wherever it has its principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.848" offset="2320039">Now, at the time this case arose and historically, there had been no requirement that a domestic corporation designate a principal place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.675" offset="2359327">That came--</text>

            <text syncTime="554.066" offset="2360895">So, in effect it's a question of fact, it's not something that is, as it were, within the control of the domestic corporation simply by putting the name of one town down when it files its annual return.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.197" offset="2469355">I believe the definition for the domestic corporation is that the principal place of business is where its executive offices are located, and so the State itself has provided a definition which would certainly be appropriate for them to also do in the context of a foreign corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.301" offset="2825770">I think the equality would have to reflect equal treatment related to the purposes of the venue laws, and in the context of the considerations that go into venue, a foreign corporation such as Burlington Northern that in fact has a major executive office presence in the State, even though its national headquarters is elsewhere, cannot be treated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.256" offset="2921587">The uncontroverted affidavit in this case, Justice Scalia, shows that Burlington Northern has its division headquarters in Hill County, Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="708.848" offset="2979997">So our position is that, consistent with equal protection, a State has the obligation to recognize that the same factors that justify treating a domestic corporation's principal place of business in Montana as its residence have equal application to a foreign corporation that in fact has a principal place of business in the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="901.702" offset="3751445">Our position is simply this, and I think this is the basic principle established by the Saunders case, that with respect to matters pertinent to venue... and that is, we're talking about trials in State district courts... that there is no substantial difference between a domestic corporation and between those foreign corporations that have been admitted to do business in the State and have actually established a place of business there, and that if the court chooses to extend to its domestic corporations the very great benefits that are attached to limiting venue to the single county where it has its residence, then there is no rational basis not to extend that same benefit to those foreign corporations that have been domesticated, are also doing business in the State, and also have what is reasonably considered a residence in the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.525" offset="6386677">Montana's venue laws, like those of virtually every other jurisdiction in this country, treat residents and nonresidents differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.156" offset="6505273">Justice O'Connor, the answer is that there are probably a dozen or so States that draw distinctions similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.672" offset="6535262">The problem is, each State has a different venue law, so for example, some States say... and these are cited in petitioner's petition on pages 21 to 23, but some States will say that if you're a nonresident you can be sued in the county of a plaintiff's residence, so they're not identical, but I think there are something like a dozen States that draw these kinds of distinctions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.713" offset="6711432">In other words... and that's a key distinction between Saunders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.836" offset="6720000">A lot of States provide that any corporation can be sued wherever it has an office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.252" offset="6741629">Montana hasn't gone that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.881" offset="6748108">That was the statute in Saunders, and it seems to me, Justice Kennedy, that's a very different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.796" offset="6767752">If it says, look, wherever you have an office, you're amenable to suit, now you're a foreign corporation, and wherever you have an office it's not going to be a limitation, that does seem to me to be an arbitrary distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.915" offset="6812264">But Montana has its own scheme, and I think it rests on this rational justification, and that is, the Montana legislature could rationally have concluded that domestic corporations tend to have an important attribute that foreign corporations like petitioners lack, and that attribute is a single, easily identifiable headquarters in the State of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.451" offset="6914455">That attribute, that single identifiable headquarters, is rationally related to Montana's distinction for two reasons: first, having that headquarters relates to the kind of convenience considerations that affect venue, and second of all, having such a headquarters means there won't be litigation over where the venue is located.</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.932" offset="7676290">When you administer a rule like this, Justice Scalia, there are some people who are going to fall on the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.528" offset="7698756">Let's take a simple rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.359" offset="7702099">If you're 18 years old, you can drive in Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.923" offset="7720281">If you're 17 you can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.494" offset="7726550">There are some people who are 17 who are very good drivers, but the State doesn't have to make an individual determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.748" offset="7751628">The State has to look across a category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.950" offset="7764375">Now, I suggest to you, if you take the following two groups that petitioner is talking about, one is those corporations that incorporate in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.757" offset="7795618">Are they likely to have their headquarters, their executive officials, and litigation hub in the State?</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.830" offset="7823935">The answer to that is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.453" offset="7830413">If you take foreign corporations, they may or may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.026" offset="7844728">Burlington Northern's litigation may be handled out of Forth Worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.298" offset="7857789">It may be handled any place within the State out of a division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.111" offset="7873045">Second of all, if you have a headquarters... and this is important to venue law... it's easy to know where to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.007" offset="7900630">There's no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.036" offset="7904810">You know, in the history of Montana there's never been a single lawsuit about where is the residence of a domestic corporation, and I think that's important because that issue is subject to interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.834" offset="7947964">So what it means is, plaintiffs know where the domestic headquarters of a Montana corporation is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.028" offset="7972728">It's an easy place to find, and indeed, as counsel points out, it's now expressly designated, but it was always designated in that we knew where the chief executive official was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.007" offset="8016614">Now, if you're a foreign corporation... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.461" offset="8038452">If you're a foreign corporation, and let's just say you have five different drugstores in Montana and your executive offices are in Chicago, there's no readily identifiable place to call residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.381" offset="8094145">The fact that you may have a few more employees or a few fewer employees in a particular place doesn't answer that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.817" offset="8315873">That's correct, and in this instance... that's an interesting point, Justice O'Connor, because in this instance Burlington Northern, for example, has its registered agent in Helena, Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.264" offset="8353698">It's basically a shop that serves as registered agent for virtually everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.610" offset="8375014">They don't claim that that's where they should be sued, and again I don't think the State has to accommodate... the mere fact of certainty that you have an agent some place doesn't give you a residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.366" offset="8422034">You could put an agent in the most far-away corner of the State for service of process, but that would not give you a residence, in the same way that a domestic corporation is entitled to say we reside in this State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.835" offset="8471980">And I would just follow that with a historical point, Justice Scalia, is that this is an area where we're talking about a tradition that goes back 100-some-odd years in that as a logical matter if a State creates a domestic corporation the logical inference is that it's going to treat it as a residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.978" offset="8544496">That inference is still the rule, by the way, under Federal venue statute 1400(b), that your residence under 1400(b), as this Court made clear in Brunette, is where you're incorporated, so I think this rule has both the virtue of historical tradition and the virtue of practical significance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2137.623" offset="8695066">I mean, they don't have a residence, they're not people, but if you're going to allow your domestic corporation artificially to acquire a residence, and thereby to be suable only in one place, you have to let out-of-State corporations artificially acquire a residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.645" offset="8763193">We don't care where it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2194.792" offset="8923794">You know, when it comes to a trial, if I am the chief executive official or the general counsel of a Montana corporation, my presence at the trial may be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.238" offset="8961515">That's... especially in a big case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.381" offset="8970188">My direct access to trial counsel has practical convenience concerns that relate to every venue kind of consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2219.433" offset="9022328">Now, it may be that an individual foreign corporation has the same kind of practical necessities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.938" offset="9044375">I don't believe Burlington Northern does, but as a rule, foreign corporations don't claim to have the same kind of practical necessity in terms of venue considerations and accessibility, and I do want to emphasize, I think Saunders is a very different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.759" offset="9107696">The statute in Saunders says wherever you have an office you're suable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.223" offset="9125459">Now, that statute, it seems to me once you say that it's impossible to say that just because you have your certificate from another State you shouldn't be suable wherever you have an office, but there's nothing wrong with Montana's single residence notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.502" offset="9186586">Once you buy that notion, then you have the rule I gave you, and second of all you have the question of administrative convenience.</text>

            <text syncTime="2932.805" offset="11875840">First of all, respondent has argued that the matter of convenience in venue is entirely different for a foreign corporation and for a domestic corporation on the theory that the significant factor with respect to convenience in terms of venue is where the chief executive officers and the corporate records are, but I'd like to step back for a moment and just look at what convenience in terms of venue really means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.565" offset="11990883">We're talking about convenience in the logistics of a trial in a State district court, and what that really means is the convenience of having an office in which your witnesses can remain and continue to get their work done until shortly before they're called on the stand to testify instead of having to leave town at least one day ahead of time, go to another city, and stay in a hotel waiting to be called.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.192" offset="12089417">It means having physical facilities, your secretaries and word processors available, in order to put together exhibits, in order to prepare witnesses for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.147" offset="12125153">This is the sort of thing, the sort of convenience and economy, related to venue, not where the chief executive officer is, who is highly unlikely to be involved, and not the place where the corporate books and records are kept.</text>

            <text syncTime="3025.430" offset="12246361">--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and our point is simply this that in terms of selecting... of identifying convenience generally, the convenience in terms of State district court litigation needs to focus primarily on the convenience of logistics in running the trial, not upon in particular... where particular individuals would be.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.321" offset="12377913">Mr. Chief Justice, Montana has complete discretion as to whether even to consider convenience or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.467" offset="12398498">Respondents have suggested that convenience is the key consideration, and I was simply responding to their argument in terms of, if that is the justification, then it applies just as much to a foreign corporation that also has a place, one place from which it would be more convenient to centralize its litigation, and the mere fact it's incorporated elsewhere, or even has its national headquarters elsewhere, does not mean it does not have a single point that would be more convenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.907" offset="12528274">My final point is simply this: the suggestion has been made that the Saunders case was different from this because in Saunders the venue for domestic corporations was at any place where the corporation had a fixed place of business... pardon me, any place of business, whereas for a foreign corporation it was any county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.650" offset="12615210">What this would mean in practice is that if you have a relatively broad venue statute for a domestic corporation so that the disparity with foreign is relatively narrow, then it's a violation of the equal protection clause, but if you have a vast disparity, the difference between one county venue for the domestic corporation and any county venue for the foreign corporation, then that passes constitutional muster, and that simply does not square with any realistic notion of equal protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.780" offset="12783752">Traditionally, Justice Thomas, this Court has considered venue laws, challenges to venue laws, under the equal protection clause rather than the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.699" offset="12827428">We think that there may be commerce clause implications here, but from a policy standpoint, this is the way this Court has treated it, and since it avoids a case-by-case determination of whether there is a burden on interstate commerce in any particular venue law perhaps as applied to any particular case, we suggest that from a policy standpoint equal protection is really what venue laws is all about.</text>
