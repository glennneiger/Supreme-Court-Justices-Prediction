            <label>Mr. Arthur N. Eisenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.318" offset="181024">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.161" offset="200459">At issue in this case is the constitutionality of Hawaii's total prohibition against write-in voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.755" offset="226791">This case began in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.898" offset="235359">In the general election that year held in Hawaii with respect to State legislative offices, one-third of those elections were uncontested; a single candidate was running unopposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.935" offset="287499">And that pattern of uncontested elections was consistent with the pattern that prevailed in the 1982 elections and in the 1984 general elections with respect to State legislative offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.426" offset="341520">One of the uncontested elections in 1986 occurred in the State legislative district, the State House of Representatives district in which Mr. Burdick lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.701" offset="382585">A single candidate was running unopposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.382" offset="393347">Mr. Burdick had no interest in voting for that candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.246" offset="408812">He did, however, want to participate in the election, and he saw his only opportunity to participate as the casting of a write-in ballot to express his opposition to the single candidate running unopposed, and to express support for an alternative candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.677" offset="470461">Hawaii, unfortunately, has a total prohibition against all write-in voting in all elections and under all circumstances, and that total prohibition was invoked to bar his right to exercise a write-in ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.886" offset="527303">This total prohibition, therefore, denied Mr. Burdick the opportunity to vote for the candidate of his choice, or in the alternative, to cast a ballot as a protest vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.715" offset="574637">Moreover, one of the unique functions of write-in voting in our society is that it serves as a safety valve mechanism, to permit voters to respond to new issues or changed circumstances that arise after the close of the petitioning period but before the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.498" offset="645795">In this case, Mr. Burdick did not realize that a single candidate was running unopposed until the close of the petitioning period and still Hawaii invoked its total prohibition against write-in voting, even to deny the use of the write-in ballot as a safety valve mechanism.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.417" offset="2509475">The Court has in Anderson and most recently in Norman against Reed suggested that while it looks first these days to the First Amendment as the source, as the textual source for the protection of the rights of electoral participation, it would reach the same result under the equal protection clause, and it doesn't much matter whether you call it a right to vote or an equal right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.733" offset="2606755">In both instances, we think that Hawaii is obligated to show that the total prohibition is necessary to the advancement of substantial governmental interests, and it has not made that showing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.751" offset="2662761">The interest in an informed electorate, while a worthwhile goal, cannot justify Hawaii's blanket prohibition, even in circumstances where there are no sore-loser candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.571" offset="2710095">If the State is concerned about sore-loser candidates it can enact a narrow sore-loser provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.856" offset="2743218">The interest in protecting parties against interparty raiding has no application whatever to a prohibition that would be extended to a general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.651" offset="2782402">Interparty raiding is a concern about voting in primary elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.404" offset="2793373">So again, Hawaii's total prohibition sweeps too broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.518" offset="2813853">We think that there is another consideration in this regard, and that is that at least one of the three established parties in Hawaii, the Libertarian Party, has now expressly requested that voters in its primary elections be permitted to cast write-in ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.039" offset="2875920">So Hawaii, it seems to us, now has a Tashjian problem, a problem confronted by this Court in Tashjian where the State, in that instance, the State of Connecticut, was imposing a restrictive measure on ballot access, and even in circumstances where the party had no interest in the protection that the State was affording it.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.134" offset="2968289">And so for these reasons we think that the interest in protecting against interparty raiding is insufficient in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.086" offset="2996188">The interest in an informed electorate, again, while a worthwhile goal, we think cannot be justified here.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.893" offset="3027326">If the State is concerned about voters voting in an ignorant way, that concern seems improbable, because it is not likely that somebody is going to vote for somebody that they know nothing about, when you have to actually go to the trouble of casting a write-in ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="753.534" offset="3153968">Moreover, if the State were concerned about the body politic in general, that is to say, if the State were concerned that everybody ought to know that are surreptitious write-in candidates afoot, then the State can do, the State of Hawaii can do what approximately 20 other States do: it can require that write-in candidates file a declaration of candidacy shortly before the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.892" offset="3255323">This mechanism satisfies the safety valve concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.024" offset="3275907">It allows write-in candidates to enter the race after the petitioning process is closed where new circumstances or new issues arise, and it provides that flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.113" offset="3332227">And if the State were concerned about an informed electorate in that regard, informing the electorate that there are other write-in candidates or indeed there are other candidates beyond those who are simply listed on the ballot, Hawaii can do, as I say, what 20 other States have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.003" offset="3399832">Finally, the interest in protecting Hawaii's runaway election provisions cannot justify Hawaii's policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.610" offset="3438284">To the degree that Hawaii has abolished general elections in these circumstances, there is no occasion to cast a write-in ballot, so this last concern about Hawaii, this concern about their provisions with respect to runaway elections, is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.541" offset="3501919">In fact, Hawaii's runaway election provisions, provisions which permit a candidate who emerges from the primary election as a victor and unopposed for at least county offices and State legislative offices, not to have to stand for election in the general election, that provision argues more forcefully in favor of a right to cast a write-in ballot in these dispositive primary elections, because in Hawaii, given the pattern of uncontested elections, and given these runaway election provisions, the right to cast a write-in ballot at the primary level is very, very important.</text>

          <turn speaker="steven_s_michaels" startTime="1366.922" stopTime="1639.273">
            <label>Mr. Steven S. Michaels</label>
            <text syncTime="1366.922" offset="5607493">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.908" offset="5643437">At the outset of our argument, we would like to emphasize three very brief points that we would like to carry through our discussion with the Court, and which we would urge the Court to keep in mind as it deliberates upon this important case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.827" offset="5695159">First, Hawaii is simply not in a small minority of States when it comes to the issue that is actually presented by this case, because rather than the mere 4 States that Mr. Eisenberg refers to, well over 30 States, and in fact, by our count, 37 States do not permit what Mr. Burdick claims the Constitution compels, namely the right at primaries and general elections to vote for whomever one pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.155" offset="5808426">Second, if this case is about voting, then this case is governed by this Court's ballot access decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.983" offset="5851685">Voting is very different from generalized speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.483" offset="5865687">It is the casting of legally effective speech, and under the ballot access decisions of this Court, Hawaii's law is plainly constitutional because viewed as a whole it does not substantially burden Mr. Burdick's ability to cast an effective vote, and if there is any substantial burden, those burdens are justified by Hawaii's compelling interest in narrowing the field of eligible candidates for the general election and promoting an informed vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.021" offset="5971848">And third, to the degree Mr. Burdick is saying that Hawaii need not seat a write-in candidate who would get a certain number of votes, but that nonetheless, Hawaii must count up and publish that speech, this case is not governed by the questions of substantial burdens or the issue of compelling State interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.714" offset="6054709">It is merely controlled by the question established by this Court's public forum cases, namely whether Hawaii has acted neutrally in excluding the purely advisory question from the ballot, I quote, if you don't like all of the people on this list, who would you vote for?</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.930" offset="6139555">That advisory question Hawaii has excluded in a neutral fashion, and because the answer... that answer to the public forum question runs in our favor, Hawaii's law is constitutional and Mr. Burdick is entitled to no relief from the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.840" offset="6203189">As the argument in the briefs and the discussion has established, it has to be the case that States have the authority under our Constitution to exclude the ability of voters to cast write-in votes for broad classes of candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.594" offset="6286154">In fact, Mr. Burdick really doesn't contend otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.649" offset="6306425">He says that we need not seat ineligible candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.690" offset="6322516">We need not seat primary losers, and we need not seat late filers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.334" offset="6341115">And if one just looks, for example, at what the right to vote means in our country, it has to mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.487" offset="6369746">Because in our Nation, and as this Court has defined what voting means in a constitutional sense, the right to vote is preservative of other rights, as this Court said in the Yick Wo v. Hopkins case, because the right to vote is legally effective speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.413" offset="6449471">It is the right, when joined with other votes, to transfer power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.494" offset="6465772">Now it is true that not all votes end up in seating a particular candidate, but the reason politicians worry about votes as opposed to just ordinary speech, which is nonetheless very important, is the fact that votes, if there are enough of them, put you out of a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.987" offset="6539751">We have eligibility rules in our Nation for a variety of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.280" offset="6564933">We have them because some people, we have determined as a constitutional matter, don't have enough experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.704" offset="6586666">But we also have eligibility rules that would serve to eliminate classes of candidates because they have too much experience, term limits for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.991" offset="6623760">And one of the great ironies of this case, if write-in voting really means the right to vote for whomever one pleases, is that the term limit movement, which is a widespread movement across this Nation, would be shut down at the outset as a matter of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.280" offset="6688962">And that--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1639.273" offset="6696903">Why would that be--</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.452" offset="6701605">--I don't understand that, explain that to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.415" offset="6709442">--Well, the petitioner, we think has essentially conceded that Hawaii need not seat anyone who in the 1994 election would vote by write-in for Governor Waihee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.151" offset="6760433">His time has come to an end at that time, and for that reason, the term limit is an effective ban that Mr. Burdick agrees Hawaii can effectuate by prohibiting votes for that category of candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.231" offset="6820724">What he is saying, Hawaii must count up all the protest speech that would be cast at that time for people that want Governor Waihee to keep serving, but we need not seat Governor Waihee for a third term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.200" offset="6876626">And what we are contending to the Court is that that protest speech is a public forum question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.055" offset="6904002">It is not a voting question because what is being cast by that protest speech is not a vote at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1727.760" offset="7050810">In other words, the former governor isn't going to have to go back to the State House on their theory, it is just that everybody is going to know that a lot of people wish he could.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven S. Michaels</label>
            <text syncTime="1763.885" offset="7195319">The point that we would emphasize to the Court also in considering this case is that this is very... at its outset, a facial challenge to Hawaii's ban on write-in voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.389" offset="7269403">The petitioner, even in the 1986 State House race that was before the court, never said who he wanted to vote for, never said whether the person he wanted to vote for was in fact Donald Duck or someone who was not eligible or so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.758" offset="7338784">And under that situation, the Court should not be speculating as to all the possible ranges of situations in which our law might operate in a tough manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.428" offset="7389566">On a facial challenge, you look to see whether there is any circumstance in which the law can be validly applied, and the petitioner has virtually conceded that there are large numbers of cases in which it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.705" offset="7434601">Secondly, the petitioner did not make any record below concerning the burden that our law may impose upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.542" offset="7481935">There was none of the typical testimony or evidence that one finds in the voting cases that have come up through the courts of appeals, that we really tried to get the signatures but we couldn't; it was too hard to get the signatures at that time of year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.883" offset="7543375">None of that... there is no such testimony in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.575" offset="7554137">And the record from our side of the case shows that there are large numbers of third parties that exist and have existed in Hawaii and large numbers of nonpartisan candidates who make it through the primary stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.294" offset="7605024">Our Hawaii law is structured around a four-part process; the party petition process which commences with the filing of the party petitions in April; there is the candidate filing deadline in July; there is the primary in September; and then the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.392" offset="7713380">And Hawaii's law should be particularly amenable to being sustained by this Court because it creates two cumulative opportunities for voters like Mr. Burdick to get the candidates they want on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.271" offset="7772939">We do have a petition route, and you can guarantee access for your chosen candidates by filing the petitions equal to 1 percent of the general electorate vote by April, and we have a primary route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.168" offset="7824453">And the routes are structured in a manner so that those persons who try to file for that automatic access in April have that 90-day period between the April deadline and the July candidate filing deadline in which all of the litigation that typically occurs about petitions must occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.993" offset="7911806">The lieutenant governor must make his decision on the petitions within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.736" offset="7926748">There is an administrative appeal authorized under our little APA for the last 60 days; and for those persons who are disqualified from that automatic access by the April deadline, they have the right to bail out and get back into the game by filing for a nonpartisan slot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.961" offset="8003653">And what we would emphasize to the Court also is that you can file a party petition even if you are just a single candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.066" offset="8036044">This is not the situation that the Court referred to in Storer v. Brown where you have to bring all this party baggage with you to file at the April deadline.</text>

            <text syncTime="2182.270" offset="8868933">That's correct, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.321" offset="8873112">Our basic, our system is structured in a way so that not only can an individual get on the ballot through the automatic access in April, because you don't have to have party committees, party officers, or rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.107" offset="8960257">The statute admonishes you to file them if you have them, but if you don't have them, you won't be kicked off the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.059" offset="8988051">But it also allows the party candidates whose petitions fail to get on the ballot through the nonpartisan process... there is no disaffiliation requirement under Hawaii law, and so it is truly a case where Hawaii has two complementary and each equally available systems for getting on to the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.494" offset="9081778">We submit to the Court that under this Court's cases in Munro v. Socialist Workers' Party is we submit our best case, that our system is wholly constitutional, and there is really no argument by the petitioner that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.921" offset="9179476">There are a couple of footnotes in the brief criticizing parts of the law, but there is no extended argument looking into the Court's cases and what the Court has decided in these cases, to challenge as a constitutional matter our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.971" offset="9239662">And if one looks to the principles that the Court adopted in the Munro case, that access at the primary stage alone would be sufficient, we have that automatic backup that you can get into at April with a 1 percent signature requirement that is equally sufficient and makes our law doubly good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.485" offset="9329733">The Ninth Circuit in this case therefore has a right to say that there wasn't any substantial burden on Mr. Burdick's constitutional interests, and the Court need not get to the second step of the analysis, as to compelling interest, except perhaps to note that there is a rational relationship between the laws, the goals that we have, and the law that is adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.350" offset="9425236">And we think that that should be the proper way for the Court to decide the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.283" offset="9440910">But even if one gets over that hump, Hawaii's law is backed by compelling State interests at every turn that are narrowly tailored to the way that the law is written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.961" offset="9483646">You simply cannot have the kind of informed voting that Hawaii mandates unless you have deadlines that stick, and although Mr. Burdick concedes that the sore-loser interest is only a narrow one, we urge the Court to look at Judge Easterbrook's opinion in the Seventh Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.393" offset="9561386">A lot more people than just the candidates are mad after the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.636" offset="9574343">Our eligibility requirements, those are conceded to be valid and can be enforced, and at the primary there is an important interest in respecting the party's ability to, in a sense, have their own house in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.198" offset="9640590">Now, Mr. Burdick says that it is enough just to say that in Hawaii our laws provide that you have to be a member of the party in order to be a party candidate at the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.126" offset="9684266">But time is really of the essence in election law, and the point we wish to make with respect to the party raiding argument is that the parties need not just to have this requirement out there, but they need the time to make that requirement effective by looking at the filing deadline to see if there really is a bona fide person who is a member of their party running in the primary, and then to go to court and to use the time we provide to go to court, if in fact they have a beef about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.395" offset="9797429">And as far as the runaway primary winner argument goes, it is true that in the Federal races and State-wide office, a person isn't automatically seated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.163" offset="10152485">That's true that that is one way, but we have chosen to balance the question a little differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.498" offset="10185817">As a matter of constitutional law in our State, we do have an open primary, and this is recognized because for a large number of races the Democratic primary was determinative, and it remained so in large numbers of races.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.414" offset="10237435">But for the protection of the Republican Party and the Libertarian Party and any other party that exists in Hawaii, what we do is two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.811" offset="10275052">One, we say that the candidates who run in the primary have got to be party members; and secondly, we provide that 60-day period between the filing deadline and the primary date for the party itself to go to court and say, this person isn't really a Republican or this person is not a Democrat or not a Libertarian or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.514" offset="10357808">And under Mr. Burdick's theory of write-in voting at the primary, what he is saying is that you can have last-minute nominations by write-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.380" offset="10393334">If he is really serious about that, that period of time that the State gives to the parties to go to court and effectuate their own interests is gone, and that is why we believe we have a legitimate narrowly tailored party raiding interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.367" offset="10485285">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.327" offset="10489151">In large measure this case is not about write-in voting at all, because Mr. Burdick has said that there are broad classes of candidates where he is asking not that a candidate be seated or that politicians need worry about write-in votes in the manner that I described before, but he is asking that Hawaii, at its own expense, count up what he writes on his ballot and publish it in the lieutenant governor's reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.950" offset="10639617">If I could just, at this point, direct the Court's attention to page 71 of the JA, these are sample ballots and this is the way the ballot looks to the voter on election day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.759" offset="10682875">These were the facsimile ballots in the 1986 election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.312" offset="10705027">And we can state to the Court with confidence, it is no crime in Hawaii to write in on your ballot, but we are not going to count it up and we are not going to publish it, and that is the law in Hawaii if you write a message on your ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.254" offset="10784857">What we are contending under that set of undisputed facts is that this is a case about a claim for State subsidization of protest speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.584" offset="10846088">Actually, it wouldn't matter if Mr. Burdick wrote in and said the lieutenant governor is a great guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.306" offset="10865001">We are not going to publish that either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.369" offset="10873256">So whether it is favorable or not favorable, we just don't publish what is written in on the ballot if it is not punched and executed in a manner required by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.244" offset="10904812">And under the Court's decisions, the Cornelius case is certainly a very powerful case for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.778" offset="10934905">This is a matter that the State can regulate, how it publishes the... and what questions it will address at the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.116" offset="10976283">Judge Posner in the Georges v. Carney case put it very well, a State could decide to have the advisory question of who if not these do you want regardless of whether they could be seated, but Hawaii, along with a large number of States has decided not to do that, and that is a legitimate decision to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.710" offset="11058621">I might just add that in that regard, our law would also be justified as a time, place and manner restriction at the ballot because what you are saying, if there is this right to cast this advisory speech, is that you must double the election ballot, that there is an advisory question tacked on to every single race from governor on down, and that conceptual overcrowding of the ballot is something that Hawaii has an interest in avoiding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.067" offset="11172097">And unless the Court has further questions, we rest on the briefs, and we ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2830.837" offset="11463101">Hawaii essentially closes off, as we said, the political process to write-in vote, and even for qualified votes, so that if somebody wants to vote for... not express a no vote, a protest vote, but vote by virtue of a write-in for somebody who is perfectly qualified to hold office, we think Hawaii's law which closes off the process 60 days before the primary election and 105 days before the general election is deficient on that ground as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.428" offset="11593504">On that issue, there was some discussion with Mr. Michaels about filing deadlines with respect to those States that require a write-in candidate to register shortly before the election, and Mr. Michaels shows several States which have quite long filing deadlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.181" offset="11664557">There are other States that we could have chosen that have quite short filing deadlines; California requires filing by write-ins 2 weeks in advance of the election.</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.195" offset="12188573">But there are some States, for example, Georgia, that has a filing deadline that continues to count the votes, and in fact, there was an unreported Federal district court decision in the 1980s, James against Falagant, where the voters voted into office, in essence, an individual who did not properly register.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.752" offset="12278853">And the question in that circumstance was whether Hawaii's prohibition against that individual from serving had to be recognized, or whether, when the voters vote in somebody who hadn't complied with the filing requirements and therefore was ineligible, whether that person had nonetheless to be seated, and the Federal district court concluded that the ineligibility would stand and that the individual wouldn't be seated, but the vote is recognized as a protest vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="3061.719" offset="12386686">No, that in fact is the appropriate approach we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.742" offset="12398807">What is at stake in this case is the right of the voters to choose, petitioner's right to direct his portion of sovereign power to the candidate of his choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.697" offset="12446559">This right, we say, is not an absolute right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.931" offset="12455545">Many States regulate write-in voting in a variety of ways, with specific focused concerns, and those regulatory measures at not at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.586" offset="12498177">What is at issue is the application of Hawaii's total prohibition against all write-in voting in all elections and under all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.532" offset="12533912">That total prohibition, we think, cannot satisfy the standard articulated by this Court in Anderson against Celebrezze.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.257" offset="12560871">That total prohibition cannot be shown necessary to the advancement of any substantial governmental interest, and the decision of the court of appeals should be reversed.</text>
