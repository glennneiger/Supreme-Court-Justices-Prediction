            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="136370">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 91-372, Georgia v. Thomas McCollum.</text>

            <text syncTime="10.077" offset="176599">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.050" offset="192481">The issue in this case is whether the Constitution prohibits a criminal defendant from exercising his peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.387" offset="229888">Respondents assert that under the facts of their case they have the right to use their peremptory strikes to excuse black jurors under the assumption that because these jurors are black they cannot be impartial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.606" offset="286731">The Georgia supreme court agreed, and held that the Constitution did not prohibit criminal defendants from racial discrimination in the exercise of peremptory strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.703" offset="327168">The State of Georgia submits that the Georgia supreme court is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.015" offset="344409">This Court has stated clearly that racial discrimination in the exercise of peremptory strikes violates the equal protection rights of the challenged jurors and harms the State's interest in maintaining public confidence in the fairness of judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.446" offset="414104">This Court has already held that prosecutors cannot exercise their peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.521" offset="442421">Civil litigants, neither plaintiffs nor defendants can do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.723" offset="455168">Criminal defendants should be similarly barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.607" offset="470737">This Court has noted in a number of decisions that peremptory strikes are not of constitutional origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.700" offset="499159">They are creations of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.863" offset="511802">If Georgia so chose it could summon jurors to the Court, conduct the voir dire to determine which of those jurors were partial, exclude those jurors, and require the State and the criminal defendant to go to trial without any peremptory strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.336" offset="585676">I would submit that such a procedure would be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.606" offset="602708">Instead, Georgia has chosen to delegate to the criminal prosecutor and the criminal defendant significant State power to determine the composition of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.914" offset="651923">Under Georgia law in practically all felony trials 42 jurors are impaneled for jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.500" offset="678359">The State has the right to exclude 10 jurors with peremptory strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.114" offset="696749">Georgia has delegated to the criminal defendant power to exclude 20 jurors... almost 50 percent of the jury panel.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.558" offset="786506">As this Court has noted in Edmondson there is State action throughout the jury selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.832" offset="815658">In Georgia, county officials, jury commissioners compose the jury list, the Clerk's Office of the Superior Court sends out a summons directing the jurors to report in the courtroom, bailiffs who are deputy sheriffs of the Sheriff's Office escort the jurors to and from the assembly room to the courtroom, in the courtroom jurors in a criminal case are given up to three oaths... these are all by Georgia statute... and the second oath that is given to all 42 jurors on the panel is that they will truthfully answer the questions propounded to them, and then during the voir dire the judge requires that the jury answer those questions that are propounded to them by the attorneys in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.144" offset="1016906">Once the voir dire has concluded, the peremptory strikes are exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.320" offset="1037594">After those strikes are exercised, it is the judge that directs the 12 jurors remaining these are the jurors you will serve in this case, you're directed to enter the jury box, and the other jurors are excused by the court generally to return to the jury assembly room.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.494" offset="1130277">There is a statutory right to individual voir dire of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.307" offset="1149503">Now, the court does not have to sequester the other jurors separately from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.423" offset="1169983">Generally the Court will empanel 12 jurors in the box but there is a statutory right to individual voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.977" offset="1196210">Jury selection in Georgia does go fairly fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.010" offset="1216377">Not as quickly as the Federal courts, but in most cases a jury will be empaneled in two or three hours, even... with the exception of a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.044" offset="1248455">It is the State of Georgia's position that when a criminal defendant is exercising this State delegated power to exclude jurors from the jury, he is acting under color of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.696" offset="1319090">This is a right created by statute, and although the State may delegate this power to the defendant in the case, it is the position of Georgia that the State may not license the defendant to exercise these peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.848" offset="1391710">It is also the position of the State of Georgia that the attorney general has standing to assert these equal protection rights on behalf of the jurors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.595" offset="6642741">In that case, of course, the Court held that a Federal public defender is not a State actor in performing the traditional defense functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.570" offset="6678581">In that case, the traditional defense function was a motion to withdraw from the case on the basis that the appeal was frivolous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2544.632" offset="10314826">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.965" offset="10324230">Although this Court has clearly held over and over again that the peremptory challenge is not of constitutional dimension, we would submit that between voir dire and the selection of the jury there has got to be some means implemented to secure the defendant's right to select an impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.870" offset="10431750">Voir dire is very limited in Federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.093" offset="10444706">The peremptory challenge was designed to operate in conjunction with the voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.939" offset="10476053">We don't think in practice the voir dire effectively determines who may be biased, who may be prejudiced, who may have empathy, who may have sympathy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.458" offset="10530179">All of the briefs make reference to various studies, and one of the studies is that it is a human tendency not to respond intentionally or subconsciously that one is biased in answering voir dire questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.129" offset="10596843">On the one hand we've got a juror, as Justice Kennedy said, who candidly admits his bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.873" offset="10627772">On the other hand, we've got a juror who is totally impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.137" offset="10640834">Most jurors fall somewhere in between, and because of the facts and circumstances of each case, they have empathies, sympathies, human experiences which affect their ability to decide the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.193" offset="10685137">We have got to have some way to ferret out as best we can those human tendencies in order to secure the right to an impartial trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.231" offset="10725261">What we're really concerned about is that ultimately if this Court were to extend State action to private attorneys in exercise of peremptory challenges, would be the natural consequence that it would have to decide peremptory challenges based on gender, peremptory challenges based on ethnic issues, peremptory challenges based on all of the other stereotypes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2674.997" offset="10836334">We're going to have to do that for the prosecution and for attorneys in private civil litigations as the law stands now, are we not?</text>

            <text syncTime="2682.894" offset="10867890">Very probably so, Your Honor, but hopefully we won't have to do it for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.847" offset="10887743">One of the ironies, and this is brought out by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in their brief in support of petitioner, is that the evil which was sought to be prevented in Batson, the exclusion from the jury of the members of the defendant's race, may have come full circle so that a ruling prohibiting parties from any peremptory challenge based on whatever reason, including race, would have the effect of prohibiting the minority defendant, the underrepresented defendant, from being able to use the peremptory challenge to have members of his or her own group on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.131" offset="11092857">The underrepresented minority defendant would not be able to use his peremptory challenge to exclude majority members to enhance the opportunity for members of his own group to be on the jury, and they recognize this as a problem, and that's why in their brief they, in a simple manner of speaking, want to have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.428" offset="11190032">They want us to be excluded solely on the issue of black jurors, but they want the black juror to still have the freedom to exercise peremptory challenges in any way they see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.276" offset="11237470">We believe that the exercise of the peremptory challenge by the defendant in a criminal case is the ultimate private choice and exercised by the defendant while performing a traditional function of defense counsel, and it should remain that way to preserve the adversarial system as we know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.700" offset="11323152">To stretch the concept of State action to encompass the defense attorney will undermine the adversarial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.049" offset="11364530">This Court must ensure the continued sanctity and right of a juror... of a defendant to be tried by an impartial jury.</text>
