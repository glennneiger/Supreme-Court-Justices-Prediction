            <text syncTime="22.929" offset="241854">The growing awareness of the dangers posed by work on hazardous waste sites to the general public and the environment prompted the Illinois legislature to enact the Illinois Hazardous Waste Crane Operators Licensing Act and the Illinois Hazardous Waste Laborers Licensing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.256" offset="303189">These Illinois licensing acts ensure that only qualified competent people engage in these hazardous waste sites in Illinois by demonstrating through training, testing, and experience their competency.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.283" offset="359300">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held the Illinois licensing acts preempted under the OSH Act, the Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act because, in addition to protecting the environment and the public safety, they also protect worker safety... workers regulated by OSHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.762" offset="441220">We urge this Court to reverse the decision of the Seventh Circuit because Congress did not intend through the OSH Act to deprive States of their historical power to regulate entry into occupations for the protection of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.856" offset="501615">While we also urge this Court to find that the OSH Act does not preempt any supplemental State regulation, I would like first to draw this Court's attention to the fact that the OSH Act does not preempt dual purpose legislation where the State has a purpose in addition to the worker safety for protecting the public and for protecting the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.541" offset="612374">Every other court of appeals and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration itself have... they have considered the question of whether the OSH Act preempts State licensing acts, have limited the preemptive effect of OSHA, and have found OSHA only preempts purely workers' health and safety matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.437" offset="691891">It does not extend to preempt matters which have as a purpose or effect the promotion of public health and safety and the protection of the environment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1509.572" offset="6188472">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.005" offset="6198190">This morning I hope to establish three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.607" offset="6208639">First, the language, structure, and purpose of the OSH Act expressed Congress' intent to allow States to duplicate or supplement an OSHA standard only pursuant to an approved State plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.831" offset="6253465">Second, the preemptive reach of the OSH Act as applied by the court below is narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.651" offset="6276766">It applies only to State occupational health and safety standards that clearly directly and substantially intrude upon the OSHA-regulated employer-employee obligations in a specific work place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.793" offset="6321383">And third, when a State occupational standard also serves other purposes, for example environmental protection, the Seventh Circuit test would preclude only those provisions of State law that directly intrude upon the federally regulated work place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.283" offset="6379271">Under State law severability analysis, other provisions would remain valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.604" offset="6396616">Unlike the other circuits that have addressed this issue, the Seventh Circuit avoids weighing the legitimacy or substantiality of various State legislative purposes, and it focuses instead on the effect of the State standard on the OSHA-regulated work place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.430" offset="6455862">It is important here to look at what Illinois actually did, in addition to what Illinois purports to be the purpose of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.851" offset="6485537">These Illinois statutes establish training, experience, and certification conditions specifically for workers at hazardous waste sites who already are subject to comprehensive OSHA standards that address the very same topics for the very same employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2507.939" offset="10181968">OSHA leaves the States three options.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.208" offset="10190954">They can regulate in areas where there is no Federal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.910" offset="10201821">They can regulate the environment and public safety directly and not by the means of regulating corporate health and safety, or they can submit a State plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.981" offset="10230138">They have three alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.016" offset="10234213">In this case, Illinois has rejected all three alternatives and done the one thing that section 18 would deny it, namely to regulate piecemeal in an area without a State plan where there is a Federal standard already in place, and indeed in this case the second question that the Seventh Circuit would ask is does the State standard regulating worker occupational safety relate to an issue, and OSHA can define that issue with an effort to accommodate federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.218" offset="10351032">As you know, under Federal executive order OSHA seeks to try to accommodate the State's interest to the greatest extent possible and can define the standard in a narrow way so as not to intrude on general purpose or obligation State laws, and here, however, the issue is the regulation of hazardous waste workers at hazardous waste sites, which is precisely the issue that Illinois addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.514" offset="10432221">Indeed, Illinois statute is more narrow than the OSHA standard, because it doesn't apply to all the hazardous waste sites that would be subject to the Federal-standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.387" offset="10475689">Finally, the Seventh Circuit through its severability analysis would seek to preserve those elements of the State law which regulate the environment or other issues that are not directly and substantially impacting the operation of the Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.468" offset="10552071">On the dual purpose regulation issue, what we have in this case is all the public benefit that Illinois ascribes to its State laws derived from workers' safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.757" offset="10597210">It's only when you hire a crane operator who has 4,000 hours of experience, and that crane operator presumably then operates safely and has fewer accidents, that there may be a public benefit that flows from that, so that the public benefits attributed to the Illinois statute are exclusively derived from the workers' safety practices which are precisely what is regulated by OSHA, and that's why this law must be preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.641" offset="10692714">In conclusion, the Illinois acts constitute worker health and safety standards that address the very same topics... training, experience, competency and certification... that are addressed comprehensively by the OSHA standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.199" offset="10742974">The Illinois acts apply only to hazardous waste workers who are subject to the OSHA standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.651" offset="10760737">Therefore, under section 18, Illinois may not duplicate or supplement the OSHA standard without filing a State plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.320" offset="10787486">Illinois claims an exemption from this process merely because it has asserted an additional public purpose for what is plainly worker-oriented, narrow legislation, but as I've mentioned, the public benefits from the Illinois training and experience provisions are derived solely from safe conduct in the work place, which is precisely the issue addressed by OSHA.</text>
