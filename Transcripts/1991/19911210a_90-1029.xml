            <text syncTime="11.590" offset="202174">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.828" offset="235193">Kodak's lack of market power is central to the resolution of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.869" offset="255359">Kodak lacks market power because interbrand equipment competition disciplines Kodak's conduct in the derivative after-markets for parts and service.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.296" offset="292976">Without evidence of market power, respondent's claims fail, and Kodak has no duty to sell them parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.360" offset="317322">Kodak's copiers and micrographics equipment, like most durable goods, require regular service and maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.376" offset="345325">Kodak chose to provide this service itself, through an in-house service organization, subject to uniform training, practices, and procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.232" offset="380747">Kodak did not have to choose this course.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.923" offset="391509">It could have used independent service outlets, as many manufacturers do.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.527" offset="405929">But in deciding what would work best in highly competitive interbrand markets, Kodak chose an equipment marketing strategy that would stress the highest-quality service available in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.283" offset="452949">And to make good on that promise, Kodak invested in the best in-house service organization it could develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.247" offset="476773">Kodak saw the rise of independent service organizations as a threat to its interbrand equipment marketing strategy and to the investments which had been made to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.775" offset="522958">So when ISO's demanded that Kodak provide them with parts, tools, service manuals, diagnostic equipment, which would be used solely to provide service in competition with Kodak, Kodak said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.214" offset="572695">It said what any competitor, in a competitive market, ought to be able to say to another competitor.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.189" offset="608639">I'm unclear about these things that the respondents wanted to buy from Kodak.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.676" offset="646569">Are they things manufactured by Kodak, or does Kodak, in turn, buy these things from other suppliers?</text>

            <text syncTime="129.961" offset="675722">In the great majority of instances, they are things that are manufactured by Kodak.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.645" offset="690455">In some small percentage of times, there are other equipment manufacturers who will manufacture a part for Kodak to be used in a copier, or in a component of a micrographics system.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.204" offset="740610">So the only source of supply would have to be from Kodak, if the respondents were to buy these parts?</text>

            <text syncTime="160.234" offset="796721">But the lack of market power that Kodak has, does not come from the source... availability of sources to ISO's; it comes from the interbrand competition and the effects.</text>

            <text syncTime="983.335" offset="4089194">There are two, central points to the argument of the United States in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.279" offset="4104972">First, the ISO claim that Kodak can possess and exploit market power in the parts and service market, when it lacks market power in the equipment market, is implausible, as a matter of antitrust law and economic theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.351" offset="4181250">Second, when a plaintiff, seeking to avoid summary judgment, attempts to put forward an implausible argument, or argument based on an implausible theory, it is required under rule 56 and under this Court's decision in the Matsushita case, to come forward with particularly persuasive, probative, and substantial evidence in support of a cogent theory of antitrust liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.131" offset="4368391">The rule for summary judgment is, of course, prescribed in rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and in particular, rule 56(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.881" offset="4415307">Matsushita stands for the proposition that this Court recognized that in antitrust cases, where conduct can be often ambiguous and can permit an inference of procompetitive as well as anticompetitive conduct, it is particularly appropriate to use the vehicle of summary judgment to prevent the deterrence of procompetitive conduct that would result from the threat of costly, time-consuming, antitrust trials, particularly where they proceed on a per se theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.869" offset="4599314">And while the district court might have been justified in granting summary judgment as a matter of pure economic models, that was not necessarily controlling, so far as summary judgment would be concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.419" offset="4721462">When Kodak came forward and set out the point that it was not contested, that it lacked market power in the equipment market, it became incumbent upon the ISO's under rule 56 and under Matsushita, to come forward with specific, substantial, probative evidence that raised a genuine issue as to a cogent theory of antitrust liability.</text>
