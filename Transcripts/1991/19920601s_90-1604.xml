            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="9.835" offset="130179">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.463" offset="148674">When Congress regulated the airline industry in the late 1970s it added a preemption provision to prevent the state from simply replacing the old federal regulation with a regulation of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.913" offset="198515">That provision prohibits the states from enforcing any law "relating to air carrier's rates, routes, or services".</text>
            <text syncTime="35.398" offset="232475">The issue here is the meaning of this phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.466" offset="244700">The National Association of Attorneys General have adapted guidelines containing detailed standards governing the content and format of airline advertising, frequent flier programs, and other airline industry practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.267" offset="303946">When the Attorney General of Texas sent a letter to several airlines threatening to enforce the fare advertising provisions of these guidelines, the airlines filed this suit claiming that the fare advertising portions are preempted and requesting an injunction against Texas enforcement of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.943" offset="374581">The District Court agreed that those portions of the guidelines are preempted and it enjoined Texas not only form enforcing the fare advertising guidelines but also from taking "any enforcement action" which would regulate or restrict "any aspect of the airline's operations relating to rates, routes, or services".</text>
            <text syncTime="93.958" offset="466636">And the Court of Appeals affirmed that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.754" offset="477817">As an initial matter, the injunction has to be vacated in so far as it restrains the operation of Texas' laws with respect to matters other than the fare advertising portions of the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.096" offset="523270">Basic principles of equity dictate that an injunction cannot issue unless the moving party is actually threatened with the irreparable injury and has no adequate remedy at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.981" offset="566738">Texas has never threatened to interfere with the airline's operations except with respect to those portions of that guidelines dealing with fare advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.441" offset="600592">But as to those portions, we do agree that they relate to rates and are preempted and that Texas' threatened enforcement of them should be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.028" offset="642911">The key in our view is that Congress preempted state laws "relating to rates", and as we have repeatedly recognized in our cases interpreting the similarly worded provision of ERISA, the Employees Retirement Insurance Security Act, that phrase relates to expresses a far broader preemptive purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.469" offset="744684">Transposing into this case, our construction of that same phrase in the ERISA cases state laws having a connection with or reference to airline rates are preempted even if they do not formally prescribe the rates airlines may charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.397" offset="796406">It is clear that the fare advertising guidelines have a reference to airline rates, each one of them specifically mentions them.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.558" offset="821066">It is also clear that they have a connection with airline fares in the sense of affecting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.384" offset="840396">Collectively, they establish binding requirements as to how tickets may be marketed if they are to be sold at given prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.312" offset="868086">As an economic matter, their compelled disclosures and restrictions would have a significant impact on the airline's ability to market their product and hence, on what fares the airlines would be able to charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.007" offset="910822">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in so far as it pertains to the guidelines restricting fare advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.940" offset="938617">Justice Stevens has filed a dissent in which the Chief Justice and Justice Blackmun have joined.</text>
