            <text syncTime="17.276" offset="213004">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.478" offset="229827">Born at the onset of the Seventies and by the early Eighties the subject of an unusual consensus of 30-plus cases, now in the Nineties the issue presented today of airport crossroads as commerce and idea marketplaces may well serve to shape the future of the public forum as we not long from now end this and enter the next century.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.509" offset="325957">And it's from the vantage point today of what so many cases, including six circuits, the Canadian supreme court, findings of Congress and the FAA with its special knowledge and airport expertise, almost 20 years of time, place, and manner regulations that have been tailored by airports throughout the country to ensure and protect the free and unburdened passenger flow at airports, also today some free market and other analysis supplied by amici, Free Congress Foundation and Concerned Women for America, and also unlike perhaps any case in recent times, a kind of special judicial notice because everyone in the courtroom has probably witnessed what's at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.074" offset="512158">Indeed, Your Honors, from the Ninth Circuit's Kuszynski... the '73 case, not the judge... to the present, no kind of forum has been the subject of so much analysis covering so many facets, and it's from this vantage point that we present this case today which began 17 years ago with a very fast track start of a TRO hearing within less than an hour of filing the case that I had with my colleague here, Mr. Berg.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.891" offset="623440">But soon the case took a slow track nose dive, and the first 13 years of the case... '75 to '88... focus solely on the airline leased terminals as opposed to the Port Authority unleased general circulation areas, which the Port Authority months before we filed the case, months before we talked about the case, said was subject to no regulations excluding ISKCON, and the Port Authority agreed to ISKCON's very limited presence and subject to detailed Port Authority tailored time, place, and manner regulations, and these regulations were altered over the ensuing 13 years as the Port Authority saw its needs increase, and I want to give an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.824" offset="815178">The only place at Kennedy Airport that was allowed then and is allowed to this day is an off-the-beaten-track area in the mezzanine area of the international arrivals building.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.382" offset="865438">It's in the vicinity of the stained glass chapel that holds regular Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish services.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.368" offset="889366">Now, during the first 13 years of the case the Port Authority neither disputed that those areas that they allowed ISKCON to be in were public fora nor did they complain about the agreement, and the airport deputy director, Mr. Sloane, testified in his deposition in 1985 that the arrangement with ISKCON worked out okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.882" offset="979436">But Your Honors, in 1988, ISKCON settled with all the airlines.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.879" offset="6195358">The agreement referred to by Mr. Fisher was made between counsel and was motivated on the part of the Port Authority by a litigation strategy in order to avoid the granting of a preliminary injunction which in our view would have granted greater access to our facilities than the agreement which we reached, and the agreement... it was always understood that the agreement was during the pendency of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.219" offset="6332762">At a hearing before the magistrate after our new regulations were adopted in 1988 Mr. Lieberman... and this colloquy is found at page 498 and 99 of the joint appendix... Mr. Lieberman, representing the Krishnas, said that he just found out about the new regulation a few days ago, but I don't really think it changes anything because the port in their opposing papers made it very clear what their policy was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.908" offset="6483541">That is, that the airport terminals are a nonforum, that their policy is to exclude the distribution of literature and solicitation of donations in the general circulation areas controlled by the port.</text>

            <text syncTime="2528.692" offset="10258653">They held that because of the nature of air travel, with passengers going through the terminal buildings, rushing to catch a plane or going to secure ground transportation, carrying luggage, that it would be more disruptive here than in Kokinda to allow solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.359" offset="10369307">I think that this case is quite close to the recent decision by this Court in Kokinda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.685" offset="10422597">In fact, I think Kokinda was a more difficult case than this case, because in Kokinda the Government had to overcome the strong presumption that any sidewalk was a public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.279" offset="10481007">In the instant case, airport terminals, unlike sidewalks, have not long been devoted to expressive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.717" offset="10522803">Significantly, in Kokinda, in the course of holding that a postal sidewalk was not a public forum, the court set forth a number of critical factors, all of which are present in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.894" offset="10583512">First, this Court noted that the Government has much greater flexibility in restricting First Amendment activity when it is acting as the operator of a facility rather than as a Government regulator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.154" offset="10644534">In the instant case, as in Kokinda, the Port Authority is acting as the operator of a facility rather than as a regulator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.342" offset="10681209">Airports, like post offices, are intended to be operated much like private businesses and be as self-supporting as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.567" offset="10718199">A second critical factor in Kokinda, and also present here, is the special purpose of the forum involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.006" offset="10755920">This Court noted that the sidewalk involved in Kokinda was constructed solely to assist postal patrons to negotiate the space between the parking lot and the front door of the post office and not to facilitate the daily commerce and life of a neighborhood or city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.635" offset="10830421">In the instant case, the sole purpose of the air terminals is to facilitate air travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.871" offset="10855394">As an airport operator, the Port Authority has a legitimate, managerial interest to preserve air terminals for their air travel purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.679" offset="10894578">A final, critical factor set forth in Kokinda which is also present here is the physical separation of the airports from the surrounding community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.820" offset="10947136">In Kokinda, the postal sidewalk was held to-be akin to the nonpublic forums of the military... the sidewalks of the military base involved in Greer and distinguished from the public forum sidewalks surrounding this Court involved in Grace.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.371" offset="12901409">The narrow pavement strip serving the post office parking lot in Kokinda, of course, is wholly unlike the complex environment and the actual use and the reality of the New York area airports that the district court found in its opinion to add up to it being a public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.515" offset="12969954">The Port Authority, as is clear, allows continuous solicitations of people to read and sign petitions and membership forums, but you can't give out a self-addressed donation mailer, you can't stand there mute holding a bucket, and you can say read this and sign this, but not give or join, distinctions that are not borne out as having any impact difference in the record of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.167" offset="13076534">And in fact this case was not ever... was not ever presented by the Port Authority as one dealing with specific impacts justifying the regulation or even before 1988 when there wasn't a regulation, they never argued the facts, and in fact the only thing in the record is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.342" offset="13145288">It's a single page, bald table with numbers, and it tells you failure to check in, to wear ID's, and some other problems that they've had in administering this, which are minor and diminished by 1980 and trail off by 1984, and the chart ends in 1986.</text>

            <text syncTime="3382.076" offset="13672230">They're not there to serve passenger flow, but they're there for economic reasons because they know when people come to rest they have time, they wander around, and they wander around to the area that the Hare Krishnas are allowed to be there now.</text>
