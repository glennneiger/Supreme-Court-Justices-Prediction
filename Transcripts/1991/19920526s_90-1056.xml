            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90919">The second case is No. 90-1056, Burson versus Freeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.797" offset="126028">Tennessee has a statute which prohibits the solicitation of votes and the display or distribution of campaign materials within 100 Feet of the entrance to a polling place on Election Day.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.661" offset="189557">Respondent, while she was the treasurer for a political campaign in Tennessee, brought this State Court action alleging that the statute limited her ability to communicate with voters and that this was in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.821" offset="262178">The State Court dismissed the suit but the Supreme Court of Tennessee reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.407" offset="280463">It ruled that the state had a compelling interest in banning such activities within the polling place itself but not on the surrounding premises, and it therefore concluded that the 100-Foot limit was not narrowly tailored to protect the State's interest and was not the least restrictive means to serve those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.142" offset="363428">I have the judgment of this Court to announce.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.232" offset="375758">We reverse the judgment of the Tennessee Supreme Court and remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.466" offset="396761">The Chief Justice, Justice White, Justice Kennedy, and I conclude that the statute does not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.974" offset="426749">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice O'Connor and Justice Souter have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.656" offset="481502">Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
