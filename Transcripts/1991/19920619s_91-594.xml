            <text syncTime="9.201" offset="127802">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.494" offset="148909">Respondents filed a state law tort suit in a New Hampshire State Court alleging that one of them had contracted AIDS from a transfusion of infected blood supplied by the petitioner, Red Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.797" offset="194153">The Red Cross removed the case to Federal District Court citing among other basis for federal jurisdiction the sue-and-be-sued provision of its federal charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.830" offset="230307">The District Court asserted jurisdiction on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.195" offset="243786">The Court of Appeals reversed concluding that the charter provision in question did not in fact confer federal jurisdiction over cases to which the Red Cross was a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.797" offset="278163">In an opinion filed today, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.529" offset="293105">This Court has construed similar sue-and-be-sued provision since the early 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.730" offset="313899">When read together, our cases support a rule that such a provision may be read to confer a federal jurisdiction if it specifically mentions the Federal Courts, though a particular Federal Court need not be mentioned by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.904" offset="358620">As the relevant provision of the Red Cross' Charter satisfies this requirement, we hold that it confers federal jurisdiction over cases to which that organization is a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.180" offset="395714">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Kennedy have joined.</text>
