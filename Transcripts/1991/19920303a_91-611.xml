            <label>Mr. Kevin M. Fowler</label>
            <text syncTime="119.809" offset="630934">Your Honor, perhaps the statute is sufficient in and of itself because it plainly prohibits discrimination against Federal officers or employees because of the Federal source of their pay or compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.190" offset="692479">And that is precisely what the Kansas Supreme Court has endorsed here under State standards of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.814" offset="714944">For the reasons set forth in our briefs, which I will attempt to elaborate on here, we respectfully submit that the decision below should be reversed, because the Kansas income tax structure plainly discriminates in favor of all retired employees of the States and its political subdivisions over retired members of the United States Armed Forces in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.280" offset="820792">Petitioners represent a class of approximately 14,000 retired members of the Armed Forces in Kansas, and their joint taxpayer spouses were applicable, who have been subject to disparate income tax treatment by the State of Kansas from at least tax year 1984 through tax year 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.944" offset="903444">Several named petitioners brought suit in 1989 challenging that disparate tax treatment in the wake of Davis v. Michigan Department of Treasury, on the basis that the Kansas income tax structure, on its face and as applied, violates governing principles of intergovernmental tax immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.627" offset="978154">Notwithstanding the arguments raised below, the Kansas Supreme Court held that differential tax treatment of military retirement income by the State of Kansas was constitutionally permissible, because it was directly related to and justified by significant differences between the classes of retirees.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.461" offset="1061537">However, in route to its decision, the Kansas supreme court violated several cardinal principles of law that this Court has recognized since at least 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.537" offset="1105840">Those principles are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.369" offset="1117125">Because the Federal Government's interest must weigh in the balance whenever intergovernmental tax immunity is at issue, the reviewing court must examine the applicable tax structure as a whole, and must focus on the nature of the classification erected by statute to determine whether the proffered reasons for discrimination furnish the actual basis for differential treatment, and if so, whether those differences furnish an adequate justification for differential treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.060" offset="1247946">The Kansas income tax structure utilizes Federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for determining an individual taxpayer's Kansas taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.058" offset="1287966">Because Federal adjusted gross income incorporates and includes all forms of retirement income... from whatever source derived... Kansas, one would think, should uniformly tax all forms of nondisability government retirement income.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.860" offset="1359124">But it does not.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.564" offset="3341922">Once a decision has been made to discriminate by giving exemptions to a favored class of State and local government employees, there is no political check in the system to turn back the clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.073" offset="3388002">And the reason for that is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.695" offset="3394480">In order to provide the check, to provide equal treatment which is mandated under the nondiscrimination clause of section 111, that would either require an exemption for similarly situated Federal retirees, which would reduce tax revenue; or, if the tax were applied uniformly, as this Court recognized in Davis, in order to provide State and local retirees with the same level of benefits, benefits would have to be increased in fact beyond the level of that necessary by a tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.677" offset="3526451">Which means once the decision to discriminate has been made, there is no political check because there are political, economic, and institutional forces against changing the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.534" offset="3565844">Because any way they turn, they are going to be losing revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.217" offset="3580577">And it may result in a tax increase across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.989" offset="3591653">And the vast majority of voters in the State will not stand for that, which is why we are here in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.123" offset="3616208">Because military retirees in Kansas have been fighting for equal treatment in the legislature for over 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.877" offset="3639195">They haven't gotten it.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.497" offset="3645674">And we are now asking this Court to provide them with equal treatment, because they are substantially analogous to every State and local government retiree for all material purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.385" offset="3689246">Military retirees must serve for at least 20 years in the Armed Forces before they are eligible for retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.770" offset="3726758">They must meet statutory criteria before they are eligible for retirement; when members of the military retire, they lose their entitlement to active duty pay and allowances and instead receive retired pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.691" offset="3782451">That retired pay is calculated based upon past years of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.723" offset="3802617">It's calculated in accordance with their highest rank of paid rate held.</text>

            <text syncTime="1287.046" offset="5299852">But to return to the question of what a significant difference would be, for purposes of Davis, we believe that significance has to be assessed in terms of a legitimate tax purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.697" offset="5354500">Now, there are many differences between Federal and State employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.998" offset="5367666">To give one example, Federal patent officers are different from any State or local government employees, because unlike State and local government employees, they're authorized to issue patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.067" offset="5411969">That is a significant difference between a Federal employee and a State and local government employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.284" offset="5532864">We believe that a neutrally drawn classification that attempted to account for double taxation by reference to the manner of funding would be a legitimate classification and would survive scrutiny under section 111.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.974" offset="5579571">However, that is not that... the... what is going on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.194" offset="5592423">In this case, it is true that no part of the military retired pay is taxed before it is received because it is not funded by employee... in any part, by previous employee contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.383" offset="5637249">It is also true that State and local government retirement benefits are funded in part through employee contributions that were previously taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.968" offset="5671522">But Kansas also exempts that portion of State and local government retirement benefits that consist of employer contributions and accumulated interest which, like military retired pay, have never previously been taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.437" offset="5729409">Now, we submit that a nondiscriminatory tax truly intended to avoid double taxation would not fully exempt State and local government retirement benefits based on their source, but would generally exempt retirement benefits to the extent they reflect previously taxed contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.748" offset="5790640">And that, by the way, is the way in which the Federal Government taxes... benefits disbursed pursuant to qualified pension plans under section 72 and section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.654" offset="5834317">So there is ample precedent for Kansas to draw a classification in a neutral way that accounted for the justification that they cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.430" offset="5861380">I would also like to address Justice O'Connor's point about the other Federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.583" offset="5882069">The legal conclusion that retired pay is current compensation in cases involving such matters as bankruptcy or laches does not necessarily govern the question in the context of section 111 and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.252" offset="5948733">As Mr. Fowler pointed out, Congress, in fact, treats military retired pay not as current pay in the Internal Revenue Code, but as deferred compensation in such statutes as the... as FICA, and in the individual retirement account statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.474" offset="6021563">So there is certainly a recognition in the Federal code that military retired pay can have aspects of deferred compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.166" offset="7452342">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.612" offset="7490167">In Kansas, military retired pay is taxable, and State retirement benefits are not taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.598" offset="7514095">And it's our position that this differential tax treatment is valid because it satisfies the test set out in Davis v. Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.632" offset="7542203">And that test requires that differential tax treatment must be directly related to and justified by significant differences between the two classes of taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.268" offset="7580760">And our position is, very simply, that these two classes are taxed differently because they are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.592" offset="7606046">And the primary justification for different tax treatment is the fact that military retirees receive current pay for current services; and State retirees receive pension benefits... they receive deferred compensation for prior services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.513" offset="7661739">The character of the compensation received by these two classes of taxpayers is fundamentally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.226" offset="7688593">And the different tax treatment is based on the nature... on the character of the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.651" offset="7706252">It is not based on the source of the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.165" offset="7716387">And taxation based on the source is the only type of discrimination that the statute prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.139" offset="7740211">The statute does not prohibit a State from drawing reasonable distinctions in its income tax structure where there's a legitimate reason for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.534" offset="7773857">The only prohibition is where it's discriminatory because the Federal Government is the source of the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.517" offset="7797785">Now there really is no question that this Court has characterized military retired pay as current pay for current services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.370" offset="7825161">And in McCarty v. McCarty, this Court stated that military retired pay differs in some significant respects from a typical pension and retirement plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.038" offset="9875878">And in Davis, the State of Michigan taxed Federal Civil Service retirement benefits, but it did not tax State retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.193" offset="9904508">And the Court recognized that there was different tax treatment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.004" offset="9919659">And if you'd like to call it discriminatory tax treatment, we can call it that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.086" offset="9931989">But the Court conducted an inquiry to determine if this different tax treatment was justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.010" offset="9955708">And I think this demonstrates first it is not just the mere fact of discrimination, not the fact that Federal retirees receive less favorable treatment than retired State employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.778" offset="9994787">That is not conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.510" offset="10001684">And the Court proceeded to conduct this inquiry, and searched for significant differences between the two classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.486" offset="10029687">Now, in Davis, it happened that the Court found no such differences, and the conclusion therefore was that since there were no differences between the two classes themselves, no intrinsic differences, the taxation must be based on some other factor, some outside factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.345" offset="10089037">And, of course, in Davis, the Federal Civil Service retirees receive their pay from the Federal Government, and the State retirees were paid by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.749" offset="10118712">So that was determined to be a tax that distinguished based on the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.473" offset="10133550">And that is why, I believe, the conclusion was that it was a violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.254" offset="10152671">Because it discriminated based on the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.266" offset="10164792">Now, there were many States just like Michigan that taxed Federal Civil Service retirement benefits, but did not tax State retirement benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.165" offset="10272312">That would be approximately $91 million that we would be required to refund to the Federal military retirees.</text>
