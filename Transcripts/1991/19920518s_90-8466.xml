            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="6.914" offset="118429">The first of these is Riggins versus Nevada No. 90-8466, and the case comes to us on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.654" offset="165450">Shortly after being taken into custody on murder and robbery charges the petitioner, David Riggins, complained to a psychiatrist about hearing voices and having trouble sleeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.467" offset="212679">The psychiatrist prescribed the antipsychotic drug Mellaril.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.539" offset="232950">Later, the defense attorney moved to suspend the administration of Mellaril during Riggins' trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.080" offset="267118">After taking testimony from doctors who had examined Riggins, the Trial Court denied the motion without explaining its reasons for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.474" offset="304735">Riggins was convicted of murder and robbery, and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.079" offset="319154">The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.657" offset="329394">We granted certiorari to decide whether the forced administration of antipsychotic medication during trial violated Riggins' rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.271" offset="379863">We hold that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.366" offset="388222">The forceable administration of medication represents a substantial interference on a person's liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.275" offset="415912">In the case of antipsychotic drugs which are designed to alter the brain's chemical balance and which may have serious or even fatal side effects, the interference is particularly severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.382" offset="468366">Thus, once Riggins moved to terminate administration of antipsychotic medication, Nevada became obligated to establish the need for Mellaril and the medical appropriateness of the drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.682" offset="517476">The Trial Court, however, denied Riggins' motion to stop administration of Mellaril without making any determination of the need for the medication or any findings about alternatives to forcing antipsychotic medication on Riggins.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.044" offset="582991">This error may well have impaired Riggins' trial rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.648" offset="597411">The testimony of doctors who examined Riggins establishes that the dosage he received was within the toxic range and may have made him nervous, drowsy, or confused during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.091" offset="643177">Such side effects may have impacted Riggins' demeanor but for jurors, the content of his trial testimony, his ability to follow the proceedings or his communication with his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.027" offset="686854">Because the record offers no basis for saying that this strong possibility of trial prejudice was justified, we reverse the judgment bellow and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.565" offset="741084">Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment of the Court; Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Scalia has joined in part.</text>
