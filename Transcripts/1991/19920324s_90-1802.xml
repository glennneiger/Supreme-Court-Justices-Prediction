            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90868">The third and blessedly shortest case is Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and Darden, No. 90-1802.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.544" offset="136948">In this case, we issued writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to determine the test of status as an employee under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act or ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.102" offset="187208">Robert Darden operated an insurance agency according to the terms of several contracts with petitioner, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.326" offset="220122">Under the contracts, Darden agreed to forfeit his right to retirement plan benefits if within a year of his termination as a Nationwide agent in 25 miles of his prior business location, he sold insurance in competition with Nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.034" offset="278950">When Nationwide relied on that condition, to deny him retirement benefits to which would otherwise have been entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.386" offset="300370">Darden sued for them claiming that they were non-forfeitable because already vested under the terms of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.065" offset="327119">Darden has an action under ERISA only if he qualifies as an employee as that term is used in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.661" offset="353451">The District Court held that under traditional common law principles, Darden had worked for Nationwide as an independent contractor and not as an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.685" offset="385529">The Court of Appeals reversed finding the common law test inapplicable in this context and holding instead that an ERISA plaintiff can qualify as an employee simply by showing that he had reasonable expectation of receiving pension benefits, that he relied on the expectation, and that he lacked the economic bargaining power to contract out of benefit plan forfeiture provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.468" offset="472674">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we unanimously reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.439" offset="488556">Under ERISA, an employee is any individual employed by an employer, a completely circular definition that explains nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.636" offset="521366">In the past, when Congress has used the term employee without defining it in any helpful way, we have construed the term to incorporate common law or agency principles for identifying master-servant relationships, and we adapt that rule here as well since nothing in ERISA suggest that construing the statute to incorporate the common law criteria would tort the congressional design will lead to absurd results.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.121" offset="611332">We remand the case to the Fourth Circuit to determine whether Darden does in fact qualify as an employee under traditional common law principles.</text>
