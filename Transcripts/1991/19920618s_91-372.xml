            <text syncTime="5.240" offset="111740">One of these is No. 91-372, Georgia against McCollum.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.146" offset="135355">The respondents who are White were charged with assaulting two African-Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.706" offset="161582">Before the jury selection began, the trial judge denied the prosecution to motion to prohibit the defendants from exercising preemptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.072" offset="215080">The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed and distinguished a recent case here where this Court had held that private litigants cannot exercise preemptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.511" offset="280804">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse that judgment and hold that the Constitution prohibits a criminal defendant from engaging in purposeful discrimination on the grounds of race in the exercise of preemptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.769" offset="345902">Doing this inflicts the harms addressed in the Batson case decided here sometime ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.249" offset="367740">A criminal defendant's exercise of preemptory challenges constitutes state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.788" offset="389892">The state has third party standing to challenge the defendants' discriminatory use of challenges and the prohibition does not violate a criminal defendant's constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.450" offset="436599">The Chief Justice, while joining the opinion, has filed a concurring statement; Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice O'Connor and Justice Scalia each have filed dissenting opinions.</text>
