            <text syncTime="17.044" offset="218106">The essential question now before this Court is whether there must exist some connection beyond the mere jurisdictional presence of the corporation in a State in order for a State to tax an apportioned share of all of that corporation's income.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.295" offset="291145">In other words, must a State have some connection with the activities of produced income in order to tax an apportioned share of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="44.459" offset="327716">We believe the answer to this question is yes for three reasons that I'd like to state briefly and then return to in more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.734" offset="352898">First, a State's power to tax a nondomiciliary taxpayer depends on the benefits and protections that the State provides to the taxpayer's activities in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.123" offset="398456">Second, over 100 years of precedent of this Court make it clear that there must be some connection beyond mere ownership between the in-State activities of the corporation and its out-of-State activities before the State can take account of those out-of-State activities in determining the in-State tax liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.681" offset="568670">Another theory, which is a well-established theory in the tax jurisdiction, is residency, and there is no question that a State of residence or domicile does have power to tax all of a corporation--</text>

            <text syncTime="165.097" offset="810355">With regard to a resident taxpayer, whether it's an individual or corporation, while in principle the State has power to tax all of the income, that power does in fact yield when there are activities in other States that are taxable by other States.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.677" offset="1200624">--Justice White, there is more than a theory, there is a practice going back 100 years, the very basis, for example, that the United States taxes all domestic corporations on income it earns in France or Germany, or wherever, is based on the notion that a domestic... a domiciliary corporation may be taxed on all of its income.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.427" offset="1263631">What is it that gives the State the power, for example, to tax an individual on all of his income wherever its earned?</text>
            <text syncTime="283.272" offset="1283066">It's the same residence-based principle, which is as well-established as the source-based principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.246" offset="1306890">However, when we have States seeking to tax the same income, it's quite clear when there's an intersection between those two principles, then it is the source State that generally may prevail over the residence State, because to allow both States to tax would violate the commerce clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.534" offset="1488075">Something more is required under ASARCO than just a flow of value into the taxing State from that nondomestic entity.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.067" offset="1562159">Justice O'Connor, we have never taken issue with the proposition that there may be apportionable income, other than income that is related by a unitary relationship between the underlying payor and payee.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.502" offset="1699981">We have certainly not taken issue with the notion that investments that are integrally related to the taxpayer's operations in the State, organically related... capital that flows in and out of the business, that certainly wouldn't be apportionable, but there is no reason, as New Jersey suggests here, because of this doctrinal foot fault, if that's what it was in ASARCO--</text>

            <text syncTime="594.194" offset="2526704">In other words, the mere fact that there was wealth in the corporation, there was money that adds to the riches of the corporation, does not give the State the concrete connection that it needs where it is not a domiciliary State to tax the income of an out-of-State corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.831" offset="2921257">If the corporation goes to a third-party banking institution and borrows based on its overall wealth, it might well make a difference to the bank as to whether or not it was willing to make the loan, but that is precisely the kind of overall attenuated notion that has never been the basis for allowing States to tax income.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.287" offset="3019060">We're talking now about income from activity such as the parking lot, or the investment, which itself is not generated by any activities in the taxing State.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.216" offset="3054795">In other words, to go into this parking lot example, what protections or benefits has New Jersey provided to the parking lots in California that would allow it to tax that income?</text>
            <text syncTime="736.941" offset="3097741">The Court has always said there must be some connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.513" offset="3104010">Now, you've suggested a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.394" offset="3107458">Clearly, if there were interconnections between the parking lot and the beauty parlors that might well justify looking to the entire unitary business, but once you say that any time anything is under a single corporate entity and in some general sense may add to the wealth of the corporation, this is simply abandoning the underlying notions that justify a portion of it in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.082" offset="3206306">Why do we... one thing, why is it the States have been allowed to look outside the State?</text>
            <text syncTime="769.217" offset="3226786">We start with a notion that States are confined territorially in their tax power.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.952" offset="3253744">Now, the original notion was, going back to the earlier cases, there must be some organic connection because as a limited exception to the principle that States may only tax within the State when in fact there's a connection between what goes on within the State and what goes on outside the State, then the limited purpose of determining the value of what's in the State, it may be appropriate to look outside the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.281" offset="3359070">Then the Court said of course, in cases like Wallace v. Hines and Fargo v. Hart, and in ASARCO and Woolworth, when you're looking outside the State you may not sweep into that tax base these unrelated assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.239" offset="3406926">You can't sweep in these bonds, you can't sweep in the parking lot or the yak farm, or whatever it might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="822.487" offset="3439840">We can't distinguish.</text>

            <text syncTime="825.210" offset="3450812">In effect, New Jersey is... would bite the hand that feeds them.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.462" offset="3463768">The first... the only reason New Jersey could look outside in the first place was because of this organic connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.797" offset="3485084">Now New Jersey says, let's abandon any notion of organic connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.089" offset="3498250">Let's just sweep it all in when it's too difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.663" offset="3508595">Now, wholly apart from the theoretical flaws in New Jersey's approach, the practical consequences of adopting New Jersey's scheme, they're absolutely astounding when you think about the existing structure that's grown up around this Court's understanding of the limits on State taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.624" offset="3584454">Over 30 State laws are based on the very distinction that underlies the unitary business principle, namely identifying income that's organically connected and is therefore apportionable because of its link, and income which is nonbusiness, which is not included.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.988" offset="3661881">All of these... if this Court were to adopt the notion that New Jersey has advanced here that everything gets swept in simply because it's within the corporation and has some attenuated connection, you have in effect invalidated the laws of 30 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.838" offset="3877235">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="892.730" offset="3720813">Because this Court has made it clear that taxation by allocation... that is, sending all of the value to a single State and taxation by apportionment, allowing all the States to allow a piece of it, is theoretically incommensurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.712" offset="3784761">It would lead to inevitable multiple taxation.</text>

            <label>Ms. Mary R. Hamill</label>
            <text syncTime="1530.944" offset="6273708">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.439" offset="6299726">We are pleased to be asked back to address the Court's questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.893" offset="6317489">As you know, we argued initially that there was no need to overrule ASARCO and Woolworth, provided that the Court would clarify the statements in ASARCO and Woolworth, that there has to be an operating relationship between the payor and payee of dividend income in order to apportion that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.166" offset="6394603">But if the Court wishes to clear up the confusion and dispel the misconceptions that those opinions have generated, it seems to us that it should overrule the two opinions, and once you get to that point... and it should do so retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.637" offset="6456461">But once you get to that point, then the question is, where do you draw the line and how do you apportion, and we see no bright line, no clear line until you go all the way to the corporate entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.187" offset="6510691">And so we say that what is received as income by the corporation, by a nondomiciliary corporation that is doing business in the taxing State, should be apportioned by that State, and the reason we believe that is correct is that when there is a common corporate management, there are inevitably going to be flows of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.862" offset="6601388">There are inevitably going to be mutual interdependence, no matter how disparate these activities seem, the parking lot, the beauty parlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.040" offset="6634093">As Justice Kennedy suggested, there may be borrowing going back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.421" offset="6651648">There may be tax losses offsetting one or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.874" offset="6661470">There may be the need for geographical diversification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.348" offset="6675367">There may be a William Agee running both of those who sees that there is money to be made in beauty parlors in New Jersey and he can generate capital to go into parking lots in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.827" offset="6721238">The permutations of that are infinite, and to ask the lower courts and the taxing authorities to pull apart these very fine, intricate distinctions is really asking too much, and it is getting into the very area that the Court addressed with the exception to the corn products... the corn products exception to the statutory definition of capital assets where we were talking about business motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.206" offset="6822802">If the motive for acquiring an asset was to further the business, it wasn't a capital asset, and therefore, it generated an ordinary loss on sale, the Court saw that problem and got rid of it in Arkansas Best and severely limited the corn products doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.866" offset="6885391">And it really seems to us that we have got to move that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2327.723" offset="9460856">The property tax cases on which Allied relies... Fargo v. Hart, Adams Express, Pullman's Palace Car... are property tax cases and the difference is that they are valuing tangible property in the State, and you can look at that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.945" offset="9529715">And you could see in Fargo v. Hart that there was $8,000 worth of property, tangible property in the State and the apportionment formula put $800,000 of property in the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3045.505" offset="12331922">If I might I would like to turn very briefly to the question of retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.528" offset="12360030">If the Court should overrule ASARCO and Woolworth, we believe it should do so retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.895" offset="12393466">We believe that ASARCO and Woolworth were not the kind of clear precedent on which litigants relied under the Chevron Oil test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.292" offset="12439128">No prior case had formulated an exclusive test of operating relationships between payor and payee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.658" offset="12480611">Corporate purpose had been sanctioned, indeed, in Adams Express Company the Court had said, quote, presumptively, all the property of the corporation is held and used for the purposes of its business, close quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.828" offset="12533274">One year after ASARCO and Woolworth were decided, the Court decided Container, it may have referred to ASARCO, not attacked it head-on, but the reasoning in Container in many, many respects undercuts ASARCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.130" offset="12606417">The recognition that the California code tracks UDITPA and the definition of business and nonbusiness income is a subtle attack on the... and the rejection of the corporate purpose doctrine in ASARCO and Woolworth because that corporate purpose doctrine really does come out of UDITPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.853" offset="12681336">It may have been formulated in a rather generalized way, but it is the UDITPA test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.417" offset="12699621">It sanctions, Container sanctions a business purpose for making an investment unitary, and that is footnote 19 that talks about the purpose of making loans to the subsidiaries, again, totally different from ASARCO and Woolworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.746" offset="12764928">Container sanctions reliance on the potential to control; whereas, ASARCO and Woolworth required actual, operating control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.783" offset="12797110">Container sanctioned the presumption that companies engaged in similar lines of business are unitary, but Woolworth was engaged in exactly the same line of business as its subsidiaries, and ASARCO's subs were in segments of ASARCO's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.265" offset="12858968">It rejects the bright line test that there must be flows of product, and it puts the burden of proof back on to the taxpayer, and if you read ASARCO it is quite clear that all the gaps, all the deficiencies in the record were construed against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.344" offset="12915288">So Container undercut ASARCO and Woolworth and after Container no corporate taxpayer had a legitimate reliance interest in ASARCO and Woolworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.272" offset="12958965">And then of course, ASARCO and Woolworth have provoked repeated litigation in the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.776" offset="12977042">The lower courts tried to square those rulings with their notions of common sense, tried to follow them and had a very difficult time doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.543" offset="13020092">We think the prospective application would not further a new rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.228" offset="13038795">We have been hurt by the ASARCO/Woolworth rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.929" offset="13057603">We, the State's fisc... the State's sovereign ability to tax, as long as it doesn't violate the Constitution and to promote, to have a new rule and then not let us have the benefit of it retroactively would be very harmful to New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.969" offset="13125835">The equities, for a similar reason favor, we think, retroactive overruling.</text>

            <text syncTime="3273.540" offset="13244118">To conclude, very briefly, again, I think Allied is trying to paint New Jersey as taking a very radical position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.014" offset="13277972">It relies on cases decided a century ago, but we have repeatedly pointed out in this case, this not the way companies operate today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.871" offset="13313395">Today they use their investments interchangeably with their manufacturing assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.486" offset="13331889">The days of Pullman's Palace Car, Adams Express Company and Fargo v. Hart are gone forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.149" offset="13354563">There is nothing wrong with the unitary business principle, but it has to be brought into the modern world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.404" offset="13379537">The Court will look in vain through everything that Allied has said about how companies invest, how they act, how they really manage these investments, and there is nothing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.170" offset="13422586">What they want is a constitutional formulary that has nothing to do with present-day economic reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.884" offset="13449440">And what we are proposing is a rule that we think is consistent with economic reality, that is clear and predictable, and that is consistent with the due process clause and puts the issue of the division of the tax base where it belongs, which is under the apportionment formula.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter Hellerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="3346.161" offset="13534599">I would like to make three points and given my experience in the first 25 minutes, I had better make my first two fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.976" offset="13573783">Ms. Hamill seems to ignore the commerce clause, that is, ignore the problem, or I guess acknowledge that there simply will be multiple taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.166" offset="13626550">This is simply a fact of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.197" offset="13630730">Well, it may be a fact of life that New Jersey is willing to live with, but it is certainly a fact of life that the Court has not permitted, that is terribly destructive to the underlying purposes of the commerce clause, namely to prevent multiple taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.349" offset="13687363">And indeed, her suggestion that because there is an exclusion for dividends, that this is a nonproblem, fails to recognize the fact that in this very case we are dealing with capital gains; fails to recognize the fact that under her regime it is not just intangibles we are talking about, we are talking about all income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.271" offset="13759043">Income from sales of tangibles, it doesn't matter, it all goes into the tax base, and therefore there is going to be multiple taxation resulting from the continuing existence of the 30-odd States that have the business/nonbusiness income distinction and States like New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.571" offset="13820170">Second, the 30 years that we have been living with UDITPA in which in fact the States have worked out these relatively workable rules, indeed, Ms. Hamill has conceded, at least for some purposes, that ASARCO and Woolworth are workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.422" offset="13883595">She says they are workable, at least they are workable for the 34 other States that don't want to do what New Jersey does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.277" offset="13903030">She wants to leave intact a system in which the preexisting unitary business principle exists for 34 States but not for New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.294" offset="13939079">What will that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.405" offset="13943572">Think of the kinds of substance versus form problems you would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.857" offset="13957365">For example, if you have a situation, going back to our parking lot, the parking lot is in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.235" offset="13990906">The beauty parlor is in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.788" offset="14005117">Under her regime, if you put the parking lot into a separate subsidiary, New Jersey cannot tax it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.943" offset="14033747">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.174" offset="14034583">Because there is no unitary connection under traditional principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.908" offset="14045555">Now suppose you take that parking lot, you dissolve it into the beauty parlor corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.992" offset="14069901">Now miraculously, New Jersey's power to tax expands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.312" offset="14083171">The Constitution does not permit this kind of form over substance result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.698" offset="14104696">It is simply indefensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.240" offset="14110861">The notion that... with respect to the retroactivity point, that Allied may not have relied on this case is simply irrelevant to the question of whether or not, if this Court should determine that ASARCO and Woolworth should be overruled, whether or not it should be applied retroactively or prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.856" offset="14205319">Under the Chevron test it is quite clear, from Justice Souter's opinion in which the Court joined in the judgment that selective prospectivity is unacceptable, and clearly this Court cannot decide this case on a retroactive, prospective basis based on whether or not a particular taxpayer relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.220" offset="14274805">It is obviously whether the taxpayers in general have relied on ASARCO and Woolworth and to suggest that this establishes, that this does not establish a new principle of law and that somehow we were to glean from Container, which actually reaffirmed, spoke favorably of ASARCO and Woolworth, that it was becoming eroded or discredited is simply contrary to common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.435" offset="14363621">New Jersey also completely fails to appreciate the complexity and chaos that will result from her approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.169" offset="14394655">The problem of having the tax base be congruent to the underlying apportionment factors is serious enough without the complication of sweeping wholly unrelated assets and wholly unrelated businesses into a single apportionable tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.202" offset="14470723">Under New Jersey's regime, New Jersey would retain the same three-factor formula regardless of the differences of the businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.547" offset="14496115">You could have, for example, an advertising business and a steel business under the same corporate roof, steel business, capital intensive, all of its property based in the steel mills would outweigh the advertising business, which was generated largely by payroll, say, in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.290" offset="14563092">The result would be complete misattribution of income without a serious look at what the underlying factors of the apportionment formula provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.387" offset="14595484">This would require the Court to become embroiled in the very controversies that presumably it thought it was getting out of over the last 10 years in developing these workable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.894" offset="14637489">ASARCO goes back 100 years, and not on a discredited basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.427" offset="14651595">The unitary business principle has been there for 100 years, has involved intangible property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.502" offset="14671971">There was no issue in Fargo v. Hart as to the particular tangible property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.395" offset="14691510">It was because intangibles were--</text>
