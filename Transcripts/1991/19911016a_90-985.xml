            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="200631">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.176" offset="212020">In the Eastern District of Virginia, what would have been a State action for trespass or public nuisance has now become a Federal case through the application of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 to the petitioner's antiabortion protest activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.900" offset="266982">The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia now monitors State obstruction actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.387" offset="288925">This case should not be in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.773" offset="302508">The Fourth Circuit holding rests on two faulty legal premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.208" offset="316196">First, that opposition to abortion constitutes invidious discrimination against women, and that petitioners' activities violate the respondents' constitutional right to interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.699" offset="362172">The interpretation of the lower courts goes a long way in making 1985(3) the general Federal tort law that this Court has long counselled against.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.740" offset="402296">There is redress available, and that is in the circuit courts of Virginia, for trespass, for public nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.744" offset="430299">And 12 State court of appeals have reviewed injunctions involving these type of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.631" offset="453914">All of those courts of appeal have approved the injunctions which prohibited trespass and blockades, and basically word for word, comma for comma, with regard to the same substantive issue as the Federal courts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.308" offset="516608">And that is prohibiting trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.908" offset="526952">We think it is important to point out that the court operated under the assumption that opposition to abortion constitutes invidious discrimination against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.449" offset="569166">This despite the court's finding of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.084" offset="579720">Judge Ellis said that it is indisputable that all the defendants share a deep commitment to the goals of stopping the practice of abortion and reversing its legalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.423" offset="621098">He stated that the defendants and their followers hope to prevent abortion, to dissuade women from seeking the clinic's abortion services, and to impress upon members of society the moral righteousness and intensity of their anti-abortion views.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.449" offset="681179">The court, however, comes to an illogical conclusion of law that those purposes constitute invidious discrimination against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.674" offset="726110">Our position is that that statement and that conclusion is wrong, and the Fourth Circuit should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.763" offset="754427">The issue of the application of this act to the petitioner's activities has been reviewed by numerous Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.850" offset="786714">And quite frankly, most courts have applied the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.154" offset="799984">But we think the mistake that the lower courts have made is applying the act to an activity that is not within the scope of this statute as it relates to classifications protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.062" offset="855573">Certainly gender, in and of itself, could be and would be protected under this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.199" offset="876157">But here, the class has been defined not by gender, but rather by an activity; seeking abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.870" offset="902802">There is no doubt that the opposition that the petitioners have in this case is not to women, but rather to the activity of abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.910" offset="947001">The court's findings of fact are detailed on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.445" offset="957137">The court itself stated that the petitioners engaged in these activities to rescue fetuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.949" offset="983155">That's what the court below said.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.551" offset="989529">And the illogical conclusion that was made was that constituted some form of invidious discrimination against women.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.177" offset="1260053">This Court, in Griffin, focused in on the animus that the petitioners' actions would have to be taken against the particular respondents because of who they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.170" offset="1308014">And I think the analogy could be if in fact you had a group of individuals that blocked a polling booth, if you will, because blacks were voting, and they didn't want blacks voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.978" offset="1355243">Well, there the animus is not against the activity of voting, it is against their race.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.203" offset="6476183">If you have 2,000 who go to the clinic, and the point of the conspiracy is to act in this massive fashion, then isn't it more reasonable to analyze the conspiracy as, one, in effect, to preclude the enforcement of laws against trespass, against assault, and so on?</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.609" offset="11177806">And though, although counsel misrepresented to you, in my judgment, one of the holdings of Griffin, the fact is we do not have to prove an intent to destroy this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.334" offset="11224722">Griffin itself noted on the remand that among the things that the plaintiffs would have to prove on remand would be simply whether or not they intended to travel interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.879" offset="11286894">Then the Court went on to say, and you could also prove that the defendants tried to prevent traveling interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.116" offset="11315837">But one... it was a disjunctive sentence, and one element of the sentence was that if you... if you simply intended, if you prove you intended to travel interstate, you've established this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.775" offset="11370485">And that to me, makes a lot of sense because this is, as I say, a basic constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.596" offset="11393787">It should not depend upon the plaintiff being able to prove a defendant's subjective state of mind as to whether or not he cared about interstate travel or he didn't care about interstate travel; the effect is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.023" offset="11451465">When the effect is to prevent interstate travel, or to make interstate travel useless, then it seems to me the travel right has been established.</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.529" offset="11709450">The facts in Griffin were simply... the allegation was they were just driving around on interstate highways to visit friends and to do errands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.986" offset="13607298">Do you know of any other instance where there's a statute that specifically says in only an action for damages it's parlayed into an injunction?</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.292" offset="13648572">No, I can't cite one to Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.611" offset="13657767">Of course 1343 just says in terms of all actions brought under the civil rights statutes, and this is one, 1985(3) is one, the court has jurisdiction to award both damages and equity relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.320" offset="13708654">And I don't frankly feel that it's necessary to look further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.539" offset="13725476">Again, a few words on the adequacies of State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.093" offset="13743762">Federal injunctions, frankly, mean more than State injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.728" offset="13766227">Federal injunctions are supported by more weight, by more marshals, by more people willing to make them work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.151" offset="13799978">We have amicus briefs here in this case where States are asking you to complement State enforcement activity with Federal enforcement activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.124" offset="13839893">This is an exercise of complementary federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.676" offset="13854103">The States want Federal help.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.862" offset="13866851">Wichita showed that this summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.230" offset="13880330">And there's no, it's just fallacious in my judgment to suggest to this Court that a State court can afford the kind of relief and the kind of protection of Federal rights that only a Federal court can do under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.776" offset="13954518">If there's nothing further, thank you, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay Alan Sekulow</label>
            <text syncTime="3458.881" offset="13986910">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.916" offset="13995060">Just a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.649" offset="13997986">With regard to the issue in Johnson Controls, the basis of the Court's opinion, or a significant portion of that opinion states that the bias in Johnson Control's policy is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.307" offset="14040618">Fertile men, but not fertile women are given a choice as to whether they wish to risk their reproductive health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.045" offset="14063501">The Court went on further; first Johnson Control's policy classifies on the basis of gender and child-bearing capacity rather than fertility alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.067" offset="14099654">Respondent, and this is from the quote, does not seek to protect the unconceived children of all its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.721" offset="14126299">The petitioners in this case, seek to protect all unborn children through their activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.041" offset="14147511">And the animus itself, or the motivation, is aimed at the entire process, all that involved with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.628" offset="14169872">With regard to the right to privacy, counsel, my brother in bar, submitted at trial that there is no State action that may stand or fall on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.218" offset="14204249">So the right to privacy claim, we think, is without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.420" offset="14216996">With regard to the issue of the right to travel, as Justice Scalia has said, it has to be purposeful because the statute in and of itself says that the activities have to be engaged in for the purpose of depriving a class, here described as women seeking abortion, their constitutional right to interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.917" offset="14299021">So the purpose has to be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.650" offset="14305917">And my brother at bar conceded that there is in fact no purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.753" offset="14326397">That is, they do not seek to find a difference between out-of-town people and in-town people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.439" offset="14341130">The last thing I'd like to say, Your Honor--</text>

            <text syncTime="3550.974" offset="14355236">And I'm not sure of the significance of it, but I notice one of the findings was that these rescues have been taking place in many places across the country and have been enjoined in New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, Connecticut, California, as well as the Washington metropolitan area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.167" offset="14408004">Does that have any relevance to the interstate aspect?</text>

            <text syncTime="3566.651" offset="14417930">I do not think so, Your Honor, because again, I think we have to look at what this Court has said, plus the statute itself requiring purposeful action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.872" offset="14450845">And here it's clear there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.058" offset="14455547">And as the findings of fact point out, it was Judge Ellis' determination that the activities, if they were to have taken place, of the petitioners, would have had an effect on interstate travel, not that there was a purposeful violation of the right to interstate travel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3602.306" offset="14560559">Because their sole independent right that is at stake here is interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.494" offset="14577382">Plus they... the interpretation respondents have given, Justice White, to the statute is pre the limiting amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.516" offset="14609460">That is they've eliminated the requirement of denial of equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.485" offset="14625343">It's any constitutional action and that is not what is at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.853" offset="14642792">And with regard to the State action issue, the State claims, as Judge Ellis pointed out, a public nuisance can be brought by a private party in a state circuit court in Virginia, and in fact, they have been brought in Virginia circuit courts, and they have been issued.</text>
