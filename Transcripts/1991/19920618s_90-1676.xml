            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.954" offset="130742">This case comes here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.756" offset="157909">The Occupational Safety and Health Administration pursuant to its authority in the Occupational Safety and Health Act promulgated regulations for the initial and routine training of workers who handle hazardous wastes.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.405" offset="228544">Subsequently, the State of Illinois enacted two laws requiring the licensing of workers at certain hazardous waste facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.872" offset="266369">The respondent, National Solid Waste Management Association, brought a declaratory judgment action in Federal District Court claiming that the state laws were preempted by the Occupational Safety Act than the regulations promulgated under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.445" offset="336691">The District Court held the state acts were not preempted because they protected public safety in addition to promoting job safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.411" offset="368560">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed holding that the occupational Safety and Health Act preempts all state law that constitutes in a direct, clear, and substantial way regulation of worker health and safety unless the Secretary of Labor has expressly approved the law, the state law pursuant to Section 18 of the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.433" offset="484649">In the opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.236" offset="511816">In part two of our opinion, a plurality of the Court holds that the Occupational Safety and Health Act impliedly preempts any state regulation of an occupational safety or health issue with respect to which, a federal standard has been established unless a state plan has been approved by the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.101" offset="599274">In parts three and four of the opinion, a majority of the Court holds that a sate law requirement that directly, substantially, and specifically regulates occupational safety and health is an occupational safety and health standard within the meaning of the Federal Act regardless of whether it has another non-occupational purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.593" offset="685269">Thus, we hold that the state licensing acts in this case are preempted by the Federal Act to the extent they establish occupational safety and health standards for the training of those people working with hazardous wastes.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.124" offset="743365">Justice Kennedy has written an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion which is joined by Justices Blackmun, Stevens, and Thomas.</text>
