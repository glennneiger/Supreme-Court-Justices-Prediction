            <text syncTime="15.260" offset="206755">Once an insanity acquittee has regained his sanity, may the Government continue to confine him in a mental institution indefinitely solely on the basis that he cannot prove that he is no longer a danger to society?</text>
            <text syncTime="30.160" offset="266314">Terry Foucha was found not guilty by reason of insanity back in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.154" offset="290347">Since that time he has since regained his sanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.637" offset="304244">And it was established at a release hearing back in 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.099" offset="318037">The Louisiana supreme court has answered in the affirmative that once an individual has been found not guilty by reason of insanity, he must, in order to gain release, prove that he is no longer a danger to himself or to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.899" offset="377282">We ask this Court to reverse the 4-3 majority of the Louisiana supreme court by finding that such a statutory scheme violates the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause and equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.297" offset="426915">Terry Foucha's plea was accepted pursuant to a statute in Louisiana that allowed the judge to accept his plea with the concurrence of the respondent's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.115" offset="474144">Since that time, as I said, he's regained his sanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.987" offset="489609">And that's been established at the release hearing in 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.958" offset="501521">He has since remained in limbo because the statutory scheme in Louisiana requires that in order to gain release the individual must prove that he is not a danger to himself or society.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.966" offset="549586">The problem is that the statute makes irrelevant his present mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.541" offset="575813">It does not consider whether he is mentally healthy or whether he's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.183" offset="594412">It makes that determination irrelevant to whether he can regain, whether he can ever gain release from the mental institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.297" offset="618863">In Jones v. United States, this Court stated that the Constitution permits the Government to continue confinement indefinitely of an insanity acquittee until such time as the individual regains his sanity or is no longer a danger to himself or to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.922" offset="697335">We believe that once he regains his sanity, the indefinite custodial confinement of this insanity acquittee must cease and cannot be based any further on his finding of not guilty by reason of insanity.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.153" offset="1006311">Your Honor, I would suggest that the statute, the reasoning in Jones specifically said... and I'm not here to tell the Court what the Court meant in Jones... but if the nature and the duration of confinement must be reasonably related to the purpose of initial confinement, and his initial confinement is based upon the fact that he was found not guilty by reason of insanity, and therefore, his confinement must continue because he is continuing to be mentally ill and dangerous, once he establishes that he is no longer dangerous... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.865" offset="1145178">Once he establishes that he's regained his sanity, then the finding of dangerousness that the Louisiana statute allows is not related to the mental illness for which he was originally committed for.</text>

            <text syncTime="1261.266" offset="5190709">The doctor, Dr. Ritter, comes in and testifies, well, I'm afraid I don't feel comfortable in certifying that he wouldn't be a danger to himself or to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.250" offset="5222683">The judge basically is given unbridled discretion because the statute does not give specific considerations for him to consider, such as the statute did in Salerno.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.007" offset="5261658">And, again, and this point is very important, the Government may be able to come in and make a carefully limited and narrowly drawn statutory requirement that allows for the indefinite confinement of an insanity acquittee even if he's regained his sanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.180" offset="5334383">But this type of indefinite confinement based upon his failure to be able to prove nondangerousness is... is clearly the most excessive type of restraint that Louisiana can fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.523" offset="5483803">The statute specifically specified the most dangerous types of criminals, major drug offenders, murderers, and those types of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.381" offset="5523196">In addition, the court, the legislature laid out specific factors that the Government was to consider and the judge was to consider in making the determination whether a limited duration regulatory confinement could be instituted in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.511" offset="5591741">Louisiana's statute isn't close.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.483" offset="5603653">It has a possible lifetime confinement in a mental institution by an insanity acquittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.618" offset="5628104">It involves all insanity acquittees with no relation to the... to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.572" offset="5647957">It gives the court no factors to consider in making its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.883" offset="5661227">And there's no showing necessary by the Government to prove the different circumstances for his release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.940" offset="5693410">Your Honor, the Government wants this Court to look at these statutes and to apply these factors in a very mechanicalistic fashion, the regulatory detention circumstances, very mechanicalistically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.540" offset="5755790">I would suggest that those sort of mechanical applications cannot be applied in this sort of situation where an individual is looking at... his liberty interests are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.427" offset="5807408">As far as the equal protection argument goes, this Court stated that in Baxstrom that the fact that a person has suffered and been convicted and was sentenced to a specific sentence, that that was not, that was insufficient to justify giving him less protection than those given to individuals who are civilly committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.526" offset="5923810">I would certainly suggest that an individual who's been found not guilty by reason of insanity should also not be given less procedural and substantive protections as those afforded to other civil committees in Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2925.625" offset="11848172">I think that, given the fact that the State does have an interest, a legitimate and compelling interest in protecting society at large, that the due process procedures are sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.180" offset="11926435">If you look at the differences between Salerno and Foucha, even though the Government has the burden in Salerno and the petitioner has the burden in this particular case, the evidence guideline is the same, clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.458" offset="11979516">You need a judicial officer to make a determination on the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.860" offset="12001145">Under Salerno, the arrestee may be detained if no conditions reasonably ensure the safety of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.646" offset="12028313">In Mr. Foucha's case, the Court determined that the conditions that were set forth by the review panel at Feliciana, the probationary conditions, were insufficient to reasonably protect the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.495" offset="12079617">In both cases, the individual can have counsel at hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.419" offset="12103336">In both cases the individual can testify himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.872" offset="12117129">He can present witnesses, which Mr. Foucha did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.352" offset="12131131">He can also present other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.355" offset="12139072">He can cross-examine the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.615" offset="12148162">In both cases, the individuals are entitled to a written judgment and they may seek appellate review or seek a writ in the next higher court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.282" offset="12186824">I think that Louisiana has provided a system of checks and balances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.607" offset="12212110">I think that this idea of this being an indefinite commitment is somewhat premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.149" offset="12238233">This individual could have received up to 30 years in prison for an aggravated burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.174" offset="12262370">He has been at Feliciana now for about 7 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.069" offset="12281909">He has a long way to go before it would even become indefinite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.120" offset="12298210">Every year he can come up and try to persuade the court that he is no longer dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.223" offset="12322556">He has not succeeded in the times that he has come up to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.367" offset="12339170">That is not to say that he cannot succeed in the future under the Louisiana statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.839" offset="12357037">On the issue of equal protection, this Court in Jones held that the holding in the Jones case accords with the widely and reasonably-held view that insanity acquittees constitute a special class that should be treated differently from other candidates for commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.434" offset="12435405">So I feel that it has already been carved out a little niche for insanity acquittees as opposed to how civil acquittees are treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.088" offset="12466020">And that is legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.207" offset="12474484">I think that the equal protection argument merges with the due process argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.741" offset="12492665">I think it is simply a matter of how long can we apply standard preventive detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.695" offset="12520460">How long can we detain these people?</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.668" offset="12528401">We've detained them before for, I think, a maximum for 17 days under Shaw v. Martin, and for longer times under Salerno... maybe for a period of weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.037" offset="12577824">In this case, even though it is a period of... of years, it can be several years, many years, still, I think the Court has previously recognized an overwhelming State interest in protecting the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.955" offset="12625472">What we are trying to prevent... we are trying to prevent a situation where an individual, an insanity acquittee, is released and then goes out and commits another crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.819" offset="12664969">I know we can't prevent all crimes from happening, it's impossible to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.622" offset="12680120">But I think the State has an interest in trying to do what it can in a situation such as this, to prevent these people from getting out and committing another crime, hurting another individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.948" offset="12721498">And I would ask the Court to keep in place Louisiana's statutory scheme for the detainment of insanity acquittees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.095" offset="12758069">Thank you.</text>
