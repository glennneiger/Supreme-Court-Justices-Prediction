            <text syncTime="1077.281" offset="4458681">That is to say, no DEA agents were in the territory of the Government of Mexico, and this activity followed on the heels of informal discussions with representatives of the Government of Mexico.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul L. Hoffman</label>
            <text syncTime="1549.833" offset="6348901">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.107" offset="6366037">This case does depend on a choice between the line of authority that begins with Ker v. Illinois and the line of authority that begins with United States v. Rauscher, and in the line of authority starting with United States v. Rauscher, this Court has made it clear on several occasions, an unbroken chain of occasions, in Johnson v. Brown, in the Ford case, in United States v. Cook, that the jurisdiction of the United States, the authority of the United States can be limited by treaty obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.848" offset="6500934">That is the basic principle of Rauscher and Rauscher really stands as an answer to all of the arguments that the Government has made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.585" offset="6539908">In the Rauscher case, there was no explicit rule of specialty, in the Webster-Ashburton treaty of 1842, nor was there any explicit mention that a violation of the rule of specialty would limit the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.635" offset="6600095">In fact, in that case there had been a conviction of somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.119" offset="6610021">Mr. Rauscher had been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.419" offset="6619216">He was physically before the Court, and yet this Court decided that our international obligations under the Webster-Ashburton treaty were more important and the Court found that in the language of the treaty, in the manifest purpose and object of the treaty, the Court had to find that there was a rule of specialty, and the Court did not defer to the executive branch version of that rule of specialty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.257" offset="6718586">In fact, there had been a diplomatic controversy raging between the United States and Great Britain for more than a decade on this very point, and the British Government had made its position very clear that a rule of specialty was required because of the background rule of customary law that the parties had to have intended by creating the language that they created in the treaty, which is the same argument that we make here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.003" offset="6809597">The Government of Mexico has made it very clear that they understood, as Canada understood, that extradition treaties, when they place specific limits on how people can be rendered, mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.982" offset="6857453">The deal was article 9, with respect to obtaining the presence of a Mexican national before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.314" offset="6878873">That was the deal that was made, and in the context of that treaty and its purpose and the entire structure of it, it must mean that the United States is not free to kidnap Mexican nationals to circumvent that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.977" offset="6961525">Justice White, it would be our view based on the language of the treaty, its purpose and the fact that it is the exclusive means, that Americans should not be kidnapped consistent with this treaty either, because the limitations, for example, on the political offense doctrine and the other limitations in the treaty also, we believe, should lead a court to conclude that kidnapping to circumvent those limitations would also be a violation of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.525" offset="7063716">But with respect to article 9, it is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.608" offset="7071970">There are very few cases of kidnapping, there are very few cases... there are no cases of kidnapping of a national in the Ker-Frisbie line that the Government argues is a backdrop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.534" offset="7111677">Article 9 makes it very clear what the deal was with respect to Mexican nationals, as Judge Browning in the Verdugo case in the Ninth Circuit found that one could base a decision, a court could base a decision on article 9 that there was a specific arrangement, but our belief is that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1836.967" offset="7497453">Rauscher said and in the words of Mr. Justice Miller, we feel authorized to state that the weight of authority and of sound principle are in favor of the proposition that a person who has been brought within the jurisdiction of the court by virtue of proceedings under an extradition treaty can only be tried for one of the offenses described in that treaty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.434" offset="7659308">Our case is not a case based on the rule of specialty, but it's based on an even more fundamental rule, and the Court's analysis in Rauscher certainly would permit this Court to look to the background rules of customary law; as they did in Rauscher, it would look to the history, where Secretaries of State of the 19th century, from the beginning of our extradition treaties on said that abductions violated the treaty, they were not consistent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.489" offset="8303487">To be sure they serve the purposes of mutual cooperation and law enforcement, but they also serve the purpose of protecting sovereign interest and they serve the purpose of protecting individual interest and that has been understood in the cases from the very beginning which have given individuals the rights to claim interests which are really sovereign rights too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.821" offset="8376839">In this particular case, the sovereign rights and the individual rights are almost identical, and they coincide in the sense that for a Mexican national, Mexico owes a duty to the respondent in this case to protect him and offer the benefits of Mexican law, and so when they are asserting their sovereign interests to prevent the United States from circumventing this treaty and bringing him to the United States they are also protecting his interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="2165.297" offset="8810785">But in the cases since then, courts have gone out of their way to point out that the foreign sovereign had not protested, and I think that that is consistent with the theory that the foreign sovereign is in a position to consent to a rendition outside of the terms of the treaty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.103" offset="9521943">One of the things that, to return to Rauscher for a moment, the point that the Government has made about the statutes really don't amount... this Court has already rejected that, I think in Rauscher and Johnson v. Brown, where the Court has said that the statutes were not an essential ground for the decision, and clearly there were no statutes in Ford and Cook of the kind that the Government claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.502" offset="9875536">So Ker is limited to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.524" offset="9887657">In addition, the Court went out of its way to say that there had been no protest and therefore Peru's sovereign interests were not at stake, and that that is a key distinction between that case and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.134" offset="9946067">In the cases since Ker, the courts have, the cases have all fallen into situations where there has been consent or acquiescence in the informal renditions or where there had been private abductions, and that's true... our recitation of the foreign cases which says that they appear to be in alignment too, that really the Ker doctrine that the Government claims as a backdrop principle has not been known widely in the world, has not been known in this country, and certainly would not have been known to Mexico as meaning that the United States could engage in state-sponsored kidnapping and that that would not affect the jurisdiction of the court to try somebody.</text>

Collins, what Justice Miller said in citing his authorities of highest respectability, it was not only common law authorities but English authorities, including his lead authority was an English authority where an individual had been seized in Belgium by an English police officer, and yet the principle stood that the court does not divest itself of jurisdiction by virtue of a forcible or illegal, flagrant if you will, kidnapping, the point remains that the jurisdiction of the court remains intact.</text>
