            <text syncTime="38.868" offset="302609">In 1972, in State v. Dixon, the Florida Supreme Court held that Florida's death penalty statute is reserved for the most aggravated and least mitigated of the most serious crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.787" offset="366348">It has held steadfastly to that position ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.370" offset="380663">The Florida death penalty statute attains this goal by a process of weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.997" offset="419220">The primary actor in this weighing process is the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.361" offset="448582">The jury has been the main actor in Florida sentencing since the very earliest days of Florida's statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.578" offset="481496">And accordingly, the Supreme Court of Florida last year held-that there is a State constitutional double jeopardy right to a reasonable jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.463" offset="525068">That is, if there has been a reasonably arrived at life verdict, then the defendant may not be sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.940" offset="562893">Accordingly, it is our position that Florida is more like a Oklahoma and Mississippi, that is, it is more like a jury-sentencing State than it is like a judge-sentencing State, such as Arizona.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.498" offset="677205">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.319" offset="684415">Nevertheless, this Court has also recognized in Proffitt and in other cases the primacy in Florida... jury... sentencing of the penalty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.779" offset="738332">And in Hitchcock, the Court held that it's necessary that the jury as well as the judge not be restrained in the consideration of mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.955" offset="778978">For instance, the Court has always recognized that the Florida system is a tripartite system.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.729" offset="802071">And it is clear from Florida law, and from this Court's recognition of the primacy of Tedder v. State, that under Florida law, the jury considers... conducts the weighing in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.609" offset="857659">The Court recognized that in Proffitt when it discussed Tedder and the importance of the jury role in sentencing, and when it discussed the heinous in the circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.525" offset="909277">In Proffitt, the Court held that the heinous in the circumstance was constitutional as construed in that decision, and that that provided adequate guidance, both for the jury and for the sentencing judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.835" offset="966537">Where... again, where there's been a life verdict which has been reasonable arrived at after the weighing of the sentencing circumstances, that is dispositive of the sentencing decision in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.095" offset="1015543">Accordingly, it's... the role of the jury cannot be sentence... cannot be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.337" offset="1040516">The Florida Supreme Court has recognized that where there is a constitutional defect in the jury proceeding, then the entire sentencing proceeding is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.024" offset="1079282">Accordingly where, as here, there's been an error in the trial court jury sentencing phase of the case that makes the entire sentencing proceeding unconstitutionally defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.385" offset="1144693">And that happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.658" offset="1153783">First with respect to the cold, calculated, and premeditation circumstance, the Florida Supreme Court held that the evidence did not support that circumstance, and that the trial court had improperly entered it into its weighing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.036" offset="1219298">Accordingly, Mr. Sochor did not get a constitutionally required correct weighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.794" offset="1258377">No actor in the State's system properly weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, so that under Parker v. Dugger, an error occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.040" offset="1299337">The only way of correcting that error would have been through a reweighing of the sentencing circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.844" offset="1326609">And the Florida Supreme Court has long, long held that it does not reweigh circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.989" offset="3827155">We are saying, however, that in order to conduct a harmless error analysis, there has to be a consideration of what the jury verdict might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.197" offset="3868010">Because if there is a life verdict, then this finding of the trial judge just counts as nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.649" offset="3893819">It has no value under the Florida system.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.783" offset="3910329">Once there is a life verdict, then it's presumed that the jury found all of the statutory and nonstatutory mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.580" offset="3949512">So that when there has been an error which could have affected the jury verdict, then we're in an entirely different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.554" offset="3977411">And that's what our argument is: that under Florida, the jury's verdict is so important that it... if the error could have affected that, and that there could reasonable have been a life verdict, then it is as though all of those mitigating circumstances were found.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.817" offset="4054420">And that's... that is something that is as clear as anything from Florida law.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.039" offset="4075318">It's been part of Florida law since well before Proffitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.412" offset="4088797">The Court recognized that in Proffitt that under the so-called Tedder doctrine, that the jury is the primary decision maker, and that where there has been this reasonably arrived at life verdict, these sorts of findings made by the judge just don't count for anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.105" offset="4167582">And we set out in somewhat excruciating detail in our brief all of the cases which say that again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.129" offset="4199661">The primacy of the jury plays into both of the issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.227" offset="4248040">I'd like to talk briefly about the second issue as to the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance, which this Court has dealt with many times since Proffitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.965" offset="4299031">In 1984, the Florida Supreme Court just simply abandoned the Proffitt definition of the circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.993" offset="4343125">Proffitt has held that the circumstance was constitutional where it was limited to the conscienceless or pitiless crime, which is unnecessarily torturous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.281" offset="4384294">In Pope v. State, the Florida Supreme Court wrote at some length its disapproval of the conscienceless or pitiless standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.366" offset="4424627">It held that the conscienceless or pitiless standard went to the mindset of the defendant, that they didn't like that because, in that case, it had led to application of the circumstance because the defendant had pled not guilty and the judge had concluded that meant the defendant had no remorse, and therefore, the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.142" offset="4519713">But the Supreme Court of Florida did not stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.124" offset="4535700">The supreme court went on to say that it disapproved of the conscienceless or pitiless limitation, that some years previously it had written it out of the jury instructions, and that now it was specifically disapproving of it, and that the defendant's mindset, quote, unquote, was no longer at issue in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.207" offset="4616053">Accordingly, the supreme court simply kicked out the Proffitt definition, putting Florida into the same position as Oklahoma in the Maynard case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.376" offset="4664640">Because Florida has not followed Proffitt, the heinousness circumstance is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.531" offset="4697346">We have two arguments pertaining to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.443" offset="4708944">One is the Maynard argument, which is that the court applies a circumstance to either the intent of the defendant, or it can hold that the intent is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.231" offset="4752098">It can apply to the manner of the killing, or it can hold that the manner is completely irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.515" offset="6249228">I think from the onset I would like to clarify a point, if in fact any confusion exists, with regard to something that was provided in the State's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.359" offset="6280575">And that is that the Tedder standard is not applied when a death recommendation is made by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.244" offset="6308160">So I want to be put on notice with regard to that, that in fact the Florida Supreme Court in applying its Tedder standard, which is the mechanism by which the Florida Supreme Court reviews the jury's recommendation, does not apply when the jury recommends death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.295" offset="6376392">It only applies when there's a life recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.598" offset="6389558">Which gets me to the point of some of the questions today with regard to what is the role of the jury in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.793" offset="6418397">From the inception, after Furman, the role of the jury in Florida has been to provide the conscience of the community, to provide the conscience of the community, some expression, some ability to come forward and express what their views are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.863" offset="6478583">And in that sense, the legislature, in creating a mechanism under the statute that allows for the jury to hear aggravating and mitigating circumstances, it provides them the opportunity to determine whether in fact life or mercy... life and mercy, for that matter... will be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.104" offset="6547546">If no mercy is given, we can be confident that that results, because they do not make findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.648" offset="6577744">There is nothing in the statute that makes findings of fact, nor is their recommendation binding, contrary to what was said today.</text>

            <text syncTime="3126.393" offset="12652781">And in fact, that's why the appellate standard of Tedder v. Florida is so... our State... is so important, because the Florida Supreme Court is the entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.409" offset="12692800">This is the means by which we bring in, we build into the appellate process the consideration of the jury, the conscience of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.946" offset="12726969">There is no other way we can articulate that because they are not required, nor should they be required, to give reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.329" offset="12756539">The only person who has to give reasons is the trial judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.121" offset="12775661">Now, true, as I have stated before, that in fact, under the appellate function, the appellate court in reviewing the appropriateness of that expression of mercy, whether no mercy or not, must give deference to that recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.832" offset="12830518">But as I started out my argument, Tedder is not a standard used by the appellate court in determining the appropriateness of the jury's recommendation of death.</text>

            <text syncTime="3202.592" offset="12957577">At footnote 14 of our initial brief, we cite the case of Lucas v. State, where the Supreme Court of Florida makes it clear they're different analyses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.689" offset="13001986">In Lucas, the court held that the death penalty was proportionate and said we cannot say, however, that the court properly found the death sentence appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.807" offset="13042423">The only other matter I want to address was the State has said that the... in effect that the jury does not weigh circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.264" offset="13088190">It makes a decision as to mercy or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.086" offset="13099475">The Florida Supreme Court does not allow a jury instruction on mercy.</text>
