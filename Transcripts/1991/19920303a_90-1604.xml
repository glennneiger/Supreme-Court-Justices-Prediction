            <text syncTime="9.956" offset="185953">Mr. Gardner.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_gardner" startTime="11.406" stopTime="150.112">
            <label>Mr. Stephen Gardner</label>
            <text syncTime="11.406" offset="191700">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.908" offset="201731">Congress did not intend to strip the State of Texas of its right to use its traditional police powers to protect its citizens from deceptive airline advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.496" offset="240078">Congress never suggested that Texas is not free to sue individual airlines in its state courts for specific violations of its general state consumer protection act, yet that is precisely the result of the decision of a court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.375" offset="299638">The district court entered and the court of appeals sustained a sweeping injunction against Texas that prohibited the State from any type of law enforcement action that would regulate or restrict any aspect of the individually named plaintiff airline's airfare advertising or their other operations involving their rates, routes, and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.920" offset="381766">If I may take just a few moments to put this case into context for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.990" offset="402038">This case arose when the State of Texas and several other state attorneys general wrote to a few airlines in November of 1988 advising them that their practices of segmenting out certain portions of their airfares from the advertised fare and putting it into the fine print of the footnotes of an advertisement, thereby reducing an ad from, say, $321 to $298, were violations of their state deceptive practices laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.593" offset="520424">We wrote to only five of the airlines that are in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.045" offset="534322">We offered those airlines an opportunity to resolve this matter without litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.532" offset="552189">Rather than taking us up on that offer the airlines themselves brought suit in Federal district court against first, the State of Texas, and later expanded that lawsuit to include 33 other state attorneys general.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.725" offset="609032">From that lawsuit the district court entered a preliminary injunction that was later converted to a permanent injunction that was as I have already set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.397" offset="643722">What this case is about is the right of the State of Texas to enforce its state consumer protection act to stop illegal, deceptive segmenting out of surcharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.789" offset="693251">It's not about anything broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.324" offset="703386">It is specifically not about the NAAG guidelines that the airlines make a bit about in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.644" offset="724702">We're not here before the Court on enforcement of the NAAG guidelines because the states never attempted to do so.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="150.112" offset="746540">Well, Mr. Gardner, we have to decide, I guess, what it is that the language that Congress used means, and it chose to use language that preempts, federally preempts state laws relating to rates, routes, or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.449" offset="855837">That's the language it chose, relating to.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.584" offset="872451">At the same time it passed it the conference report referred to that language as preemption of anything regulating rates, routes, or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.356" offset="903484">It is necessary to look at what Congress--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="191.389" offset="911634">Well, it would have been easy enough for Congress to have used the language of preempting state law determining rates or setting rates or something of that kind, but it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.266" offset="963148">It said relating to.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.233" offset="970984">And in the ERISA context this Court has interpreted that identical phrase in a fairly expansive manner, I guess.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_gardner" startTime="215.741" stopTime="296.459">
            <label>Mr. Stephen Gardner</label>
            <text syncTime="215.741" offset="1009019">--Yes, Your Honor, we urge the Court not to apply the same interpretation precepts to the Federal Aviation Act as this Court has indeed applied in the ERISA context, for the very simple reason that ERISA was a very broadly preemptive law because its prime scope was in essence for the Federal Government to occupy the field of regulation of employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.654" offset="1100656">That was not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.022" offset="1106194">We have to look at what, coming into 1978 when this relating to language was adopted, what was Congress setting about to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.478" offset="1147990">Prior to '78 the states and the Federal Government, as this Court recognized in the Nader decision in 1976, had enjoyed a dual enforcement relationship with respect to consumer protection type laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.488" offset="1208072">Nothing prior to '78 preempted the states or prevented the states from enforcing their own laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.410" offset="1235762">In 1978 what was Congress trying to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.212" offset="1250913">Was Congress trying to keep the states out of the area of consumer protection?</text>
            <text syncTime="281.683" offset="1272855">I think our answer is affirm nothing of the kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.885" offset="1285603">What Congress was doing in 1978 was deregulating the Federal Government's control that had existed since the thirties, I believe, of the rates, routes, and services, the direct--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="296.459" offset="1331892">Well, can you say that advertisement of airline rates and fares does not relate to airline rates and fares?</text>
            <text syncTime="310.452" offset="1387899">Can you really say that?</text>

            <text syncTime="313.987" offset="1402005">I think the answer is no, I may not be able to say that, but that's not what Congress was preempting.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.372" offset="1419559">Congress was preempting only state laws that relate to rates, routes, and services, not state laws that relate to advertising which then relate to rates, routes, and services.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.830" offset="1457384">Well, suppose in this case that the State of Texas or some other state had passed a statute containing all of the prohibitions and guidelines set forth in the guidelines that you issued here.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.222" offset="1510988">Would that statute be valid?</text>

            <text syncTime="356.514" offset="1572114">But if the Court... rather, if the Court applied the broad scope of ERISA reading and brought all of the concepts that underlie the broad ERISA preemption and use that in interpreting what Congress intended, not when it said relating to, but when it enacted the 1978 act, then under that kind of interpretation perhaps you could say that regulation such as the NAAG guidelines would relate to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.402" offset="7971696">And after, with the advent of deregulation the airlines, under, continuing to be under the regulation, regulatory authority of the Department of Transportation, developed a new pricing policy, a pro-competitive pricing policy called yield management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.296" offset="8047242">And yield management is designed to maximize revenues while at the same time filling as many seats as possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1986.004" offset="8090083">This is a long-winded answer, but I think I will get there ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.123" offset="8106593">One of the features of yield management is a multi-tiered pricing structure under which different prices are charged for different tickets that have different restrictions relating to refundability, advance purchase, length of stay, time of day or day of week, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.219" offset="8186945">And the other salient feature is that the mix of fares on every flight is under continuous review and revision as the flight date approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.462" offset="8243892">The NAAG guidelines are contrary, actually they make it virtually impossible to conduct yield management programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.354" offset="8291540">DOT has recognized this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.904" offset="8297704">It has pointed out that yield management is an essential feature of competition in a deregulated air transport market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.411" offset="8335739">The guidelines require every restriction, each and every restriction, to be stated in each and every ad with respect to every advertised fare, and they also require that these restrictions be etched in stone for a fixed period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.289" offset="8411285">These requirements simply cannot be squared with the pro-competitive yield management program that Congress, I mean that DOT approves and the airlines have developed under deregulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2189.002" offset="8902073">Just one last note with respect to advertising and the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.639" offset="8920673">The problem therefore with the guidelines that may or may not pertain to other consumer protection laws is that they directly interfere with the efficiency innovation and low prices that Congress explicitly asked DOT to help further in its administration of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.885" offset="9005623">Now, more generally, Justice O'Connor, as you pointed out in the preceding argument given by Mr. Gardner, section 105 does employ the same preemptive formula as the ERISA statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.931" offset="9069780">Just as ERISA preempts all state laws that relate to employee benefit plans, so section 105 preempts all state laws relating to rates, routes, and services of any air carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.821" offset="9121398">And in construing ERISA this Court has said that the phrase relating to means having a connection with or reference to the statutory subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.462" offset="9163925">I understand that that's not, that's just the beginning of analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2260.116" offset="9186599">But we submit that that first step is one that needs to be taken, that section 105, like the similarly worded ERISA statute, should be construed as preempting all state laws that have a connection with or reference to airfares.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.826" offset="12965368">It is the State's position that the Deregulation Act involved essentially the passive withdrawal of direct controls on rates, routes, and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.465" offset="13003925">In fact the act did more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.967" offset="13013956">It set forth in addition new regulatory criteria to guide the Department of Transportation in exercising the authority that remained to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.941" offset="13053871">Among the authority that remained to the Department of Transportation was the authority to protect consumers against deceptive practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.928" offset="13085845">In exercising that authority it seeks to balance pro-competitive objectives with protection of the consumer, recognizing first of all that there is not necessarily a cut and dried right answer to that balance, although there certainly would be, Mr. Chief Justice, in the situation that you have put forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="3278.541" offset="13260238">If the ordering paragraph alone is the focus of the Court's attention, we think that the only part of it which is problematic is the part that follows fair advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.682" offset="13308826">There is talk about other operations involving rates, routes, or services.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.822" offset="13349368">But certainly state laws that restrict the content and form of airfare advertising are preempted, and we understand the ordering paragraph to be entirely consistent with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3342.065" offset="13514358">Let me suggest that we take ERISA as a starting point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.665" offset="13524702">In ERISA the Court has said reference to or connection with equals relates to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.652" offset="13548735">Now, the Court has also recognized that every conceivable relationship is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.056" offset="13570364">In a footnote in the Shaw v. Delta Airlines case the Court said that there may not be preemption when a law affects benefit plans in a way that is, quote, too tenuous, remote, or peripheral to justify preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.750" offset="13637133">So that the application of a state law that says the bad faith denial of benefits is preempted, even though that is just an application of a general state law that says bad faith breeches of contract are actionable, it is preempted when applied to an ERISA benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.831" offset="13717381">Whereas the application of a garnishment statute is not preempted because that is just too peripheral, too unrelated to the purposes of the act, in this case the fostering of a pro-competitive environment, opening up a market and preserving space for the pro-competitive policies of the Department of Transportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.771" offset="13865130">We are asking the Court to determine that the Federal Aviation Act does not preempt a law of general applicability that does not have a direct and substantial effect on the rates, routes, and services of an airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.114" offset="13918524">But the unfortunate result there is that that does require a remand because we have not had a record developed here, as we have pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.184" offset="13946841">We do not believe the airlines will succeed in developing such a record because we do not believe that regulation of false advertising does indeed have that direct and substantial effect, nor, to use the ERISA test, does this state law have any connection with rates, routes, or services, or any reference to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.748" offset="14025104">Even if you use the ERISA test our enforcement of our state consumer protection law fails.</text>
