            <text syncTime="164.684" offset="802666">I do believe, however, that the expansive language that was used shows a much broader reach than what this Court indicated in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.649" offset="834535">In discussing Chaplinsky they cite several times the afflict injury dictum from that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.850" offset="863270">That took a standard that was very close to an offensiveness standard and raises the adverse emotional harm idea from the Hustler Magazine case in that the outrageousness standard is raised, and it really opens a hole to the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.865" offset="1027319">The Court has acknowledged that the court cited Chaplinsky and Brandenburg, the lower court, but in doing so in Brandenburg, for instance, they refer to the provocative standard, and the Government may censor provocative conduct, and it does so in a manner where it cites the likely to incite imminent lawless action as opposed to the likely to and directed to, and I think the real significance of that is that you could have a hostile audience censor the expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.588" offset="1134212">I believe that Brandenburg was written in terms of a sympathetic audience, and I believe you get into the heckler's veto problem if you allow that type of interpretation, and the language of that opinion, combined with the language of the ordinance as originally written, really leaves that open as a possibility... as a significant possibility, combined with the injury language from Chaplinsky.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.283" offset="1212997">The problem is that the language is so broad that it leaves open the possibility of an outrageousness standard, a dignity standard as imposed, and just generally an offensiveness standard, and that is--</text>

            <text syncTime="300.020" offset="1344027">I don't believe that the Court has construed, nor did the New Hampshire court originally construe, the inflict injury dictum as part of that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.001" offset="1371926">I believe the Court has limited that to immediate breach of the peace type of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.342" offset="1537229">I don't mean to downplay the victims... in this case, for instance, certainly in the fact situation there were laws available to the State, significant and hard and tough laws, to deal with an ugly fact situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.220" offset="1684769">That is one of my positions, that in doing so, even though it is a subcategory, technically, of unprotected conduct, it still is picking out an opinion, a disfavored message, and making that clear through the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.543" offset="1738058">It's a paternalistic idea, and the problem that we have is that the Government must not betray neutrality, and I believe it does, even when it picks out a subcategory.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.976" offset="1771809">With the First Amendment, it does not necessarily follow that if you punish the greater you can punish the lesser.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.341" offset="1861252">I believe the Court would feel that that was betraying sympathy or hostility to a political viewpoint, and I believe the same principle is in course here, because I think the problem we have is that we have... regardless of whether those symbols are mere examples, we have the possibility, the real possibility, that we have a Government signaling its disagreement with the particular type of opinion.</text>
