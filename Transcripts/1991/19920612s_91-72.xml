            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90872">The opinion of the Court in No. 91-72, Federal Trade Commission versus Ticor Title Insurance Company will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="9.792" stopTime="275.487">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="9.792" offset="129951">In this case, the Federal Trade commission versus Ticor Title Insurance Company, the Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against six of the nation's largest title insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.164" offset="175509">The allegation was horizontal price fixing in their fees for title searches and title examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.338" offset="200168">One company settled by consent decree but the other five firms continue to contest the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.422" offset="220544">The Commission charges the title companies with violating 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act which prohibits unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.221" offset="255652">One of the principal defenses the companies assert is state action immunity from anti-trust prosecution as contemplated in the line of cases beginning with Parker versus Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.975" offset="294732">The commission rejected this defense and the firm sought review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.107" offset="315212">Ruling that state action immunity was available under the state regulatory regimes in questions, the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.181" offset="343528">The Commission sought certiorari with respect to the regulatory regimes of Wisconsin, Montana, Connecticut, and Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.956" offset="370696">We granted certiorari to consider two questions: First, whether the Third Circuit was correct in its statement and application of the state-action immunity doctrine; and second, whether the Third Circuit erred by departing in the findings of fact entered by the administrative law judge and adapted by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.470" offset="428688">We now reverse the Court of Appeals under the first question and remand for further proceedings under the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.027" offset="450944">The preservation of the free market and of a system of a free enterprise without price fixing or cartels is essential to economic freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.810" offset="478111">Continued enforcement of the national anti-trust policy grants the states more freedom, not less, in deciding whether to subject discrete parts of their economy to additional regulation and controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.846" offset="522206">It was against this background in Parker versus Brown that we upheld a state-supervised market sharing scheme against the Sherman Act challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.918" offset="550523">We announce there the doctrine that federal anti-trust laws are subject to suppression by state regulatory programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.806" offset="574033">Our decision was grounded in principles of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.856" offset="586258">Our decision since Parker, made clear that active supervision of the state's policy is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.211" offset="607679">The inquiry is not to determine whether the state has met some normative standard such as efficiency in its regulatory practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.175" offset="635473">Its purpose is to determine whether the state has exercised sufficient independent judgment and control so that the details of the rates or prices have been established as a product of deliberate state intervention, not simply by agreement among private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.858" offset="690225">The question is not how well state regulation works but whether the anti-competitive scheme is the states' own.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.357" offset="716243">Federalism serves to assign political responsibility, not to obscure it.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.637" offset="737350">Neither federalism nor political responsibility is well served by a rule that essential national policies are displaced by state regulations intended to achieve more limited ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.371" offset="780296">For states which do choose to displace the free market with regulation, our insistence on real compliance with the test we have set out will serve to make clear that the state is responsible for the price fixing, it is sanctioned and undertaken to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.420" offset="832541">Where prices or rates are set as an initial matter by private parties subject only to a veto if the state chooses to exercise it, the party claiming the immunity must show that state officials have undertaken the necessary steps to determine the specifics of the price fixing or rate setting scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.047" offset="895025">The mere potential for state supervision is not an adequate substitute for a decision by the state, and under these standards, we conclude that there was no active supervision in either Wisconsin or Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.037" offset="939016">The administrative law judge found and the Commission agreed that in these two states the rate filings were checked at most for mathematical accuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.289" offset="963989">Some were unchecked all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.886" offset="970363">In Montana, a rate filing became effective despite the failing of the rating gear to provide additional requested information.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.090" offset="999202">In Wisconsin, additional information was provided after a lapse of seven years during which time the rate filing remain in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.802" offset="1026056">These findings are fatal to respondent's attempts to portray the state regulatory regimes as providing the necessary component of active supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.800" offset="1054059">The findings demonstrate that whatever the potential for state regulatory review in Wisconsin and Montana, active state supervision did not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.396" offset="1088436">Neither of these were expressed, we think the Court of Appeals should have the opportunity to reexamine its determinations with respect to the regulatory regimes of Arizona and Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.355" offset="1124276">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.800" offset="1146010">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion; the Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice O'Connor and Justice Thomas join; and Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas joins.</text>
