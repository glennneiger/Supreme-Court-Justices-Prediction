            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="14.797" offset="150155">These cases involve the Railroad Passenger Service Act of 1970 and that Act created a corporation called the National Railroad Passenger Corporation but it is better known as Amtrak.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.984" offset="198847">Amtrak's purpose is to provide inner city rail passenger service and it, along with the Interstate Commerce Commission are the petitioners in these consolidated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.217" offset="231866">The case has raised questions regarding the proper interpretation of an imminent domain provision in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.614" offset="253391">Amtrak's Montrealer train service operates between Washington D.C. and Montreal.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.702" offset="277737">For part of the way, the train at one time operated on railroad tracks owned by the Boston and Maine Corporation, and Boston and Maine as a respondent in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.474" offset="312846">In the early 1980s, Amtrak ran into difficulties with the Montrealer service which eventually forced it to cancel the service and Amtrak claims that poor maintenance of its tracks by Boston and Maine was the cause of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.403" offset="360598">Amtrak then reached an agreement with Central Vermont Railroad, another petitioner here and a competitor of Boston and Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.086" offset="387347">Under that agreement, Amtrak was to acquire Boston and Maine's tracks and transfer them to Central Vermont in exchange for the use of the track and a promise from Central Vermont to properly maintain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.228" offset="431860">Amtrak requested and received a condemnation order from the ICC pursuant to an imminent domain provision in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.638" offset="457564">We granted certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after that court held that the relevant section of the Act does not permit condemnation of the property which Amtrak intends to convey to a third party following condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.446" offset="512735">And the court held that rejecting a contra-interpretation of the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.320" offset="532274">After the Court of Appeals' decision, Congress amended the statute to add a sentence stating that Amtrak was authorized to re-convey condemned property.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.939" offset="562681">The Court of Appeals, nonetheless, denied rehearing holding that the amendment did not affect its reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.274" offset="584101">The ICC's condemnation order was based on the agency's interpretation of the controlling statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.807" offset="602178">The agency relied on the statutory presumption of need to conclude that Amtrak had established its entitlement to the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.886" offset="630495">In so doing the ICC implicitly adapted an interpretation of the statute and that which Amtrak was permitted to make a judgment regarding its need for the property sought so long as the property would be used in Amtrak's rail operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.032" offset="683053">We hold today that the ICC's was a reasonable interpretation of the condemnation provision in the statute and therefore, the Court of Appeals erred in setting aside the ICC order.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.220" offset="719834">The ICC is the agency charged with the administration of the statute and under our well-settled doctrine, the ICC's interpretation of that provision is entitled to great deference from the reviewing court's.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.191" offset="763719">The judgment of he Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.769" offset="782005">Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Blackmun and Thomas join.</text>
