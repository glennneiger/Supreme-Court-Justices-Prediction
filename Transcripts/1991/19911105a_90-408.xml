            <text syncTime="44.077" offset="324027">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="47.279" offset="336775">Can Yakima County impose real estate property tax on fee lands owned by tribal members and the Yakima Indian Nation and collect its real estate excise tax on the sale of those fee lands?</text>
            <text syncTime="62.205" offset="396543">It is our position that this authority exists, that Congress has reaffirmed that authority on a number of occasions since its inception in 1887, that this Court has uniformly held that the tax on fee lands is appropriate, and that generally everybody agreed with that position, including the Solicitor General and its staff until 1989... we say, and believe in response to the decision of the district court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.391" offset="521304">In 1887, the General Allotment Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.795" offset="538858">The General Allotment Act, for the purposes of this case, provided a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.199" offset="560488">First, land was to be held in trust for a 25-year period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.650" offset="578251">At the end of that trust period, the individual allottees were to receive fee patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.971" offset="603537">With those fee patents went two things: (1) citizenship, and (2) the responsibility of paying tax... along with the rights of alienation of that property, and the ability to sell and deal with it as any other citizen would.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.349" offset="673128">In 1906 the Congress reaffirmed and clarified, we believe, its intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.289" offset="708863">In 1906 the Burke Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.657" offset="718372">It was passed in... partly in response to one of this Court's opinions in In Re Heff, to reaffirm that you didn't become a citizen until the fee patent was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.214" offset="764556">But when it was issued, you became a citizen; and secondly, the 1906 act shortened the trust period, or at least it allowed the Secretary to shorten the trust period from 25 years into a basically an individual decision of the Secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.235" offset="1120657">In 1906, this Court was called about in Goudy v. Meath to address this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.104" offset="1140093">Do tribal members who own fee patent have to pay real estate property tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="254.274" offset="1164752">This Court said, it requires a technical and narrow construction to hold that involuntary alienation continues to be forbidden, while the power of voluntary alienation is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.065" offset="1211982">And it is disregarding the act of Congress to hold that an Indian having property is not subject to taxation when he is a subject to all the laws, civil and criminal, of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.075" offset="1260047">Subsequent to that... particularly the 1906 act and also this Court's decision in Goudy... and I think, parenthetic, it's important to understand because the Government has raised it, but what about property that doesn't follow exactly from the Allotment Act itself?</text>
            <text syncTime="295.435" offset="1329428">The property in Goudy came from a different act.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.053" offset="1339877">Do you remember the facts in Goudy?</text>
            <text syncTime="300.136" offset="1348236">They talked about a 10-year trust period that had already expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.605" offset="1362133">It was not patented under the General Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.640" offset="1374254">And they talked from this time forward in terms of fee patents and trust lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.861" offset="1391182">Trust lands were not subject to tax; fee lands were.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.729" offset="1406646">In the early twenties, as a result of this particular statute, the Secretary began to issue patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.299" offset="1432873">Many of the Indians lost their land to tax sales, the type of tax sale that generated the litigation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.488" offset="1461608">The Congress was called upon to address this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.107" offset="1476132">And in 1927, the Congress did not... which they could have done... say, you don't have to pay real estate property tax any longer on your fee lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.713" offset="1510509">The Congress' choice, rather, was to say, you can't be forced to take one of these patents unless you don't... unless you want it.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.495" offset="1837666">We submit, however, that that clearly was not the intent, that the taxation of these lands were meant to apply to all lands patented in any manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.436" offset="1877477">And I think that Goudy reiterates that, and this Court's subsequent opinions would indicate that... in which this very specific issue has been addressed, i.e., should these lands... or the proceeds from these lands... be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.594" offset="1930035">And that distinction has never been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.863" offset="1939126">The cases are replete; the statutes are replete; the congressional record is replete, that the distinction is between trust and allotted lands... I mean, excuse me... trust and fee land.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.735" offset="1982594">And the method by which... the technical method by which the fee is obtained is of no consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.304" offset="2016866">And I think in some respects, this is... our position is bolstered by the '79 opinion of the Solicitor which we cite in our reply brief, in which the Solicitor in that opinion says that, after acquired, a title appears in his opinion, at least, at that time, is also covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.100" offset="2080083">So that the distinction for the county assessor and for the... tax collectors among the counties is is it fee land or is it trust land.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.789" offset="2118849">And if it's fee land, it is going to be taxed because it is freely alienable.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.193" offset="2136507">To get involved in the very stilted, in our opinion, interpretation of the proviso puts us in a difficult position, and one that would not coincide, we believe, with this Court's ruling in Goudy.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.119" offset="2196171">The tribe and the Government make a big deal, in some respects, in terms of the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.023" offset="2223756">We submit, again, the Indian Reorganization Act was adopted partially because of, again, this similar problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.629" offset="2254267">Lands were being lost; the tax... the land base of the tribe was being diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.997" offset="2275688">In the Indian Reorganization Act, the Congress, again, addressed this issue and they did so by saying there will be no more allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.687" offset="2310483">They extended the trust period indefinitely and allowed for the Secretary to return some of these lands to trust, to get them out of the tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.077" offset="2351965">We submit that that... and again, Congress could have addressed the tax issue and chose not to, and allowed section 349 of 25 U.S.C. to remain on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.837" offset="2411002">In 1939, this Court in Board of Commissioners v. Jackson County was dealing with the problem... okay, because by this time, the Court had decided that if you didn't consent to the patent, then the taxes needed to be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.264" offset="2472755">But the Court, in dealing with this as it was... as it directed... or as it was... what the consequences of this were for the county said, in consequence, Jackson County in 1919 began to subject the land to its regular property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.439" offset="2529493">It continued to... subject... excuse me... it continued to do so as long as this fee-simple patent was left... undisturbed by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.879" offset="2567214">Jackson County, in all innocence, acted in reliance on a fee patent given under the hand of the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.549" offset="2593859">Here is a long, and unexcused delay, referring to trying to get the money back on behalf of the individual Indian, and the assertion of a right for which Jackson County should not be penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.591" offset="2638058">The lands of this Indian and the lands of other Indians had become part of the economy of Jackson County, which we believe, crucial and in part of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2698.299" offset="10940922">There's no disagreement between the parties as to the general principles of preemption in Indian law that govern this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.468" offset="10965582">Those principles, which are rooted in both ancient treaties and current Federal statutes, provide that State taxation of Indian activities and property on a reservation is preempted, unless Congress carves out an exception to that rule in unmistakably clear terms.</text>

I think it's the use of the word solicitor, that it wasn't clear... it was an opinion of the Solicitor of the Interior Department in 1979 that did not give that construction to Moe with respect to real property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.293" offset="11340909">But the Interior Department has now over-ruled that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.978" offset="11355642">There are several reasons why we believe that... ah... Moe controls in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.834" offset="11383018">But first let me... let me explain the two... there are two separate theories, or bases for an immunity from taxation that are at issue here, and it's important to keep them distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.374" offset="11425232">Under section 5 of the General Allotment Act, allotments made to individual Indians were held in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.045" offset="11451877">Although section 5 did not expressly say so, this Court's decision in Rickert held that a State could not tax the allotment while it was held in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.901" offset="11487299">The principle was, that the trust allotment was an instrumentality of the United States Government, in furtherance of the policy of carrying-out the allotment of lands under the Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.174" offset="11528364">It was designed to protect only the individual Indian, to give him a period of preparation, at the conclusion of which he would be fully assimilated into the larger society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.113" offset="11568174">The rule of preemption, which is what is at issue here, is something quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.665" offset="11586355">It turns on the statutes and treaties governing the reservation and tribal affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.469" offset="11609552">It does not turn on the tax immunity of an individual Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.337" offset="11625017">And the Court drew that very distinction in Moe, itself, where it said... in the jurisdictional part of the Court's holding... that the tax immunity at issue here is one of preemption, based on treaties and statutes, not based on the Federal instrumentality doctrine which has since been repudiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.363" offset="11685203">With that in mind, it becomes quite clear the way section 6 of the General Allotment Act operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.702" offset="11710489">The principal clause of section 6 that was at issue in this Court's decision in Moe, affirmatively declared that when an Indian received a fee patent, at the conclusion of the trust period, he shall have the benefit and be subject to all provisions of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.747" offset="11782692">In Goudy v. Meath, the Court held that that included State tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.449" offset="11797529">And that, of course, was consistent with the design of the General Allotment Act, which was that individual Indians would receive their own allotment and be assimilated into the larger society, and therefore be subject to State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.471" offset="11837549">But in Moe, this Court held that section 6 did not have the present effect of allowing the taxation of personal property on Indian reservations, that that was untenable in light of subsequent developments: the enactment of the Indian Reorganization Act which repudiated the allotment policy, and its goals of breaking up tribes and tribal relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.719" offset="11914558">It was inconsistent with the enactment of 18 U.S.C. 1151 and the definition of 1948 and was inconsistent with the regulation... the comprehensive regulation of adjudicatory jurisdiction in Public Law 280.</text>

            <text syncTime="2957.578" offset="11977983">It did not... it did not, because, again, let me... because of the distinction I was drawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.632" offset="11998254">Goudy and the first clause of section 6 of the General Allotment Act had the effect of removing the instrumentality doctoring immunity, by virtue of the fact that it was the United States holding the land in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.273" offset="12044752">It was an immunity that really derived from the United States' interest in the individual allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.392" offset="12061262">Moe, however, discussed the preemption rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.427" offset="12073382">And if we look at that tax... or the proviso to section 6, it becomes clear, looking at the language of it, why this does not carve out an exception to the rule of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.501" offset="12121657">What the proviso says is that the Secretary may accelerate the time, essentially, to grant a fee patent, if he concludes that the individual Indian is capable of managing his own affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.709" offset="12166587">Well, the premise obviously is removing the Federal protection instrumentality rationale for the tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.511" offset="12189784">Then it says all restrictions as to sale, encumbrance, or taxation of said land shall be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.748" offset="12214653">Now, first of all, the word 5 of the General Allotment Act by virtue of the land being held in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.472" offset="12269614">Furthermore, the use of the word "remove" indicates that what the statute was speaking to were those restrictions that were in place at the time... those that were already attached to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.780" offset="12310783">When lifted, the Indian would become part of the Indian community... of the non-Indian community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.815" offset="12330950">So in those respects, all that section 6's proviso does when a patent issues at an accelerated rate, si to subject... is to remove whatever restrictions are in the General Allotment Act, itself, to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.027" offset="12395838">But it does not speak to the broader question of preemption of State tax--</text>

            <text syncTime="3276.484" offset="13253595">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.836" offset="13271044">Mr. Bjur indicated that he believed that section 6 was adopted after Goudy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.359" offset="13301137">Our reading of that is... is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.459" offset="13309497">That section 6 was, in fact, adopted... the amendment to section 6 was adopted in May of 1906, and Goudy was decided in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.250" offset="13348680">The Court in Goudy could have relied on the second proviso but chose not to... in fact, relied on the general laws provision which we think gives it a stronger meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.105" offset="13384102">Additionally, I think one of the questions that the Chief Justice asked points out the problem that this case addresses: when was the statute repealed?</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.878" offset="13419211">Policy of Congress has gone from one side to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.080" offset="13436034">After the IRA, after the so-called repudiation of the assimilation policy, the Congress of the United States passed Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.269" offset="13476785">On the day that that law was passed, Public Law 280, the Congress adopted a resolution that stated, in part, the policy of Congress... this is a quotation now... as rapidly as possible to make Indians within territorial limits of the United States subject to the same laws, entitled to the same privilege and responsibilities as are applicable to other citizens of the United States, and to end their status as wards of the United States and to grant them all of the rights and prerogatives pertaining to American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.871" offset="13591201">We submit that that was a policy change.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.462" offset="13641565">But it was passed some 19 years after the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.583" offset="13662045">The policy of Congress has gone from one side to the other, and back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.468" offset="13677614">But as that policy has changed, this statute, providing specifically for taxing of fee lands, has never changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.538" offset="13705826">It has remained the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.073" offset="13711991">This issue should be addressed to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.508" offset="13721709">The Congress should decide... all of the counties, many of the counties are like Jackson County, Kansas, which was raised in that 1939 case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.483" offset="13773640">The Congress... if it wants to say, fee lands will no longer be taxed, then they should look at it in terms of testimony and determine that we're going to replace those taxes, much as they've done with school districts.</text>
