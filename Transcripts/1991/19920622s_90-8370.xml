            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="6.855" offset="118223">The first case is Medina versus California, No. 90-8370.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.260" offset="135882">The case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.785" offset="153959">In 1984, Medina, who is the petitioner in this case, went on a crime spree and committed several robberies, he murdered three persons and was tried on three counts of first degree murder as well as a number of lesser offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.184" offset="207562">Before trial, Medina's counsel moved for a hearing to determine whether he was mentally competent to stand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.443" offset="232535">At the conclusion of the hearing, the Trial Court instructed the jury under the California Penal Code that a criminal defendant is presumed to be competent and that Medina had the burden of proving that he was incompetent by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.905" offset="290423">The jury found Medina competent to stand trial and in a subsequent trial proceeding, he was convicted and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.368" offset="320307">On appeal, Medina argues that the Penal Code violated his right to due process by placing the burden of proof on him to establish that he was not competent to stand trial and by establishing the presumption that he was competent to stand trial unless proven otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.184" offset="371507">The California Supreme Court rejected these arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.052" offset="383000">We granted certiorari in a decision filed today, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.695" offset="397525">As an initial matter, we reject Medina's argument that his due process challenge to the Penal Code should be analyzed under the three-factor balancing test set forth in Mathews versus Eldridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.075" offset="439111">In our view, Mathews did not provide the appropriate framework for assessing the validity of state procedural rules which like the one at bar are part of the criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.645" offset="477355">In the field of criminal law, we have defined the category of due process violations in a narrow way.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.446" offset="496581">The Bill of Rights speaks in explicit terms to many aspects of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.655" offset="513404">Expansion of those constitutional guarantees under the open-ended rubric of the Due Process Clause invites undue interference with both considered legislative judgments and the careful balance of the Constitution strikes between liberty and order.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.987" offset="562723">Furthermore, although we have invoked Mathews in resolving due process claims in two criminal law cases, the United States versus Raddatz, and Ake versus Oklahoma, it is not at all clear that Mathews was essential to the results reached in those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.030" offset="622909">In our view, the proper analytic approach is that set forth in Patterson versus New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.068" offset="639105">In Patterson, we have recognized that it is normally within the power of the state to regulate procedures under which its criminal laws had carried out, including the burden of producing evidence ad burden of persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.240" offset="679751">And we sated that the state's decision in this regard is not subject to prescription under the Due Process Clause unless it offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.587" offset="729175">Based on our review of the historical treatment the burden of proof in competency proceedings, the operation of the challenge rule, and our precedents, we cannot say that the allocation of the burden of proof to a criminal defendant to prove incompetence violates a recognized principle of justice that can be deemed fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.200" offset="799601">With regard to the presumption of competence imposed by the California Penal code, we seem no reason to distrub the California Supreme Court's conclusion that in essence the challenge presumption is a restatement of the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.684" offset="841502">In light of our determination that the allocation of the burden of proof to the defendant does not violate due process, it follows that this aspect of the statute also withstands scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.173" offset="875461">Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Souter has joined; Justice Blackmun has a filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens has joined.</text>
