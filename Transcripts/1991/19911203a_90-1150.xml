            <text syncTime="58.560" offset="377548">The second section of article III of the Constitution limits the judicial power of the United States to nine carefully defined kinds of cases and controversies and none others.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.989" offset="435330">The question presented in this case is whether the United States District Court violated that constitutional limitation by awarding attorney's fees to Coastal and the other defendants as a sanction from Mr. Willy's asserted bad faith litigation, even though the Federal court never possessed article III subject matter jurisdiction over the controversy following the defendant's wrongful removal of the case from a State court, and even though Mr. Willy did not impede, obstruct, or delay the Federal court's resolution of any jurisdictional question, but instead correctly and repeatedly, and eventually successfully, contested the Federal court's unconstitutional exercise of the Federal judicial power over the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.535" offset="605440">We believe that this case is controlled by the court's decision in United States Catholic Conference against Abortion Rights Mobilization, Incorporated, that the district court's sanction order violated article III, and that that order and the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit mistakenly affirming it are unconstitutional and therefore should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.877" offset="854857">In 1985, represented by another Houston lawyer, George Young, Mr. Willy filed a State court lawsuit against Coastal and other defendants alleging a number of exclusively State law causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.776" offset="906475">The principal one of these arose under a Texas supreme court decision, Sabine Pilot Service Company against Hauck, which recognizes a remedy in Texas for those whose employment is wrongly terminated solely because of their refusal to violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.304" offset="960601">Mr. Young's petition on Mr. Willy's behalf alleged that Coastal had fired him because of his refusal to falsify environmental reports or to participate in the company's ongoing violations of State and Federal environmental laws at several of its facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.355" offset="1016712">Coastal and the other defendants wrongly removed the case to the United States District Court in Houston on December 30, 1985, almost 6 years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.675" offset="1625992">The present statute, as Your Honor knows, is title XVIII, section 401.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.179" offset="2260036">And the example, of course, of res judicata, collateral estoppel, similar sorts of administrative devices that are simply more important constitutionally than allowing, for example, absence of subject matter jurisdiction to be raised long after the judgment is entered and long after the case has otherwise been closed.</text>

            <text syncTime="573.338" offset="2436728">I was perviewing the transcript of the argument in Catholic Conference yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.911" offset="2450939">I recall the question coming up that the Court was interested in knowing what is colorable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.656" offset="2469956">And counsel for the parties were unable to define it.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.006" offset="2483330">Then the question was asked, what did the Second Circuit mean when it used the term colorable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.731" offset="2502243">And I think there was still some question.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.450" offset="2509139">I think the Court in Catholic Conference decisively and soundly repudiated the idea that because a Federal court looks like it has the constitutional power to act, that that's the functional equivalent of its having the constitutional power to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.332" offset="2572669">I think we've also pointed out in our brief that there's an observation in Szabo Food, which was quoted in Cooter &amp; Gell, a very important case that I would like to turn to in a moment, Judge Easterbrook suggested that if a district court elects to proceed forward with the case and to supervise discovery under rule 16 and to conduct a trial and to enter a judgment, and then discovers at the end that the court doesn't have article III subject matter jurisdiction, it can nonetheless treat any derelictions by counsel of the parties that occurs during that period as appropriately sanctionable, either under rule 11 or under an inherent power.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.034" offset="2719477">But we think that's flatly mistaken.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.533" offset="2761482">And I had thought that at least since Turner against the President and Directors of the Bank of North America, a case decided by this Court in 1799, that if it's a tossup, if the judge says to herself, gee, I don't know whether I have jurisdiction or not, it's equally balanced, the presumption is the court doesn't have jurisdiction unless promptly dismissed or remand the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.030" offset="6515487">Just as opposing counsel has already acknowledged, there are two bases upon which we believe that the court has jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.156" offset="6543908">The first is the inherent power and manifestations of that inherent power represent both the inherent power to police proceedings as well as the inherent power to determine jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.801" offset="6586540">As a separate and independent basis, however, we suggest to the Court that the necessary and proper cause through which the Rules Enabling Act was passed and rule 11 was promulgated also provides a sufficient constitutional basis which is the question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.481" offset="6645264">That is the constitutional basis for rule 11 sanctions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.975" offset="6663236">Now, opposing counsel is willing to concede that inherent power certainly exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.129" offset="6683820">Inherent power exists outside of article III, section 2 subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.832" offset="6706704">And once this concession is made, it becomes extremely difficult, indeed, I would suggest impossible, to reconcile the position of the petitioner in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael A. Maness</label>
            <text syncTime="2781.478" offset="11269250">Mr. Chief Justice, the Court stated in Catholic Conference that a court, Federal district court's subpoena power under Federal Civil Rule 45 cannot be greater than its article III subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.996" offset="11323272">I suggest exactly the same principle compels the holding that a court's sanction power under rule 11 cannot be greater than its article III subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.932" offset="11367053">I would have thought at least since Sibbach against Wilson &amp; Co. and in light of the express provisions of Federal Rule 82, that this isn't a rule 11 case because rule 11 can't enlarge the jurisdiction of the Federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.521" offset="11417417">And we're talking here about jurisdiction in a most fundamental sense, the power of a court to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.075" offset="11439673">Another distinction, and I think it's crucial in light of the discussions we've had this morning is that in Catholic Conference the civil contempt sanctions were imposed against a nonparty and therefore were immediately appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.853" offset="11498710">In this case, by contrast, we were stuck to the fly paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.776" offset="11510413">And conceivably, if the district court had not granted Coastal's motion to dismiss, we might have been in the Federal district court much longer than we were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.130" offset="11535804">Finally, I would like to leave the Court with this hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.542" offset="11545522">What makes Coastal's argument somewhat compelling is the assumption, and I think it's an appropriate assumption, that the district court acted in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.538" offset="11577495">But suppose the district court acted in bad faith, suppose from the beginning it said, look, I realize I don't have article III subject matter jurisdiction, but I've got to decide this case anyway since it's very important question of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.173" offset="11616052">And if I leave it to the State courts, they're probably going to botch it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.196" offset="11628068">Is it conceivably arguable then if the district court proceeds to hear and preside the case over a period of years that the court could then attempt to award attorney's fees to the party wrongly moving the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.143" offset="11675925">And if the Court is going to draw a distinction between good faith exercises of colorable article III power and bad faith exercises, then it's right back where it was at Catholic Conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.638" offset="11709884">And seven members of the Court, seven members of the present Court, rejected that argument fairly conclusively and fairly persuasively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.474" offset="11741231">We think the Federal judicial power under article III doesn't depend on subjective mental processes of judges or litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.088" offset="11763696">It depends upon the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.681" offset="11778011">The sanctions order in this case violated the second section of article III and should be reversed.</text>
