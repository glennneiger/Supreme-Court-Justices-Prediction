            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90859">The second case that I have to announce for the Court is the opinion in Estate of Floyd Cowart versus Nicklas Drilling Company, No. 91-17.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.641" offset="137357">The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.943" offset="150627">It creates a comprehensive scheme to compensate workers injured or killed while employed on the navigable waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.335" offset="176123">This case raises questions regarding a provision of the Act governing settlements by injured workers of lawsuits that they file against third parties who may have been responsible for the workers' injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.283" offset="219904">The Act allows injured workers to pursue actions against third parties without sacrificing compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.970" offset="242683">The Act provides for an offset against the employer's liability of the amount received from a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.581" offset="265148">One provision of the Act, Section 33(g), places limits on the right of the worker to settle third party lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.628" offset="293360">The statute states that if a person is one who is entitled to compensation and if he enters into a third party settlement for an amount less than his entitlement under the Act, he must obtain the written consent of the employer to the settlement before the settlement is entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.247" offset="355845">Failure to do so results in termination of benefits under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.147" offset="371414">It is uncontested that the petitioner in this case did not secure his employer's written consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.533" offset="392939">The question before us is whether he was a person entitled to compensation and so, subject to the written consent provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.593" offset="421151">He argues that because he was neither receiving benefits nor had an adjudication resolved in his favor at the time of the settlement, he does not fall within the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.523" offset="456887">We granted certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit after the en banc Court held that the petitioner was a person entitled to compensation and had forfeited his right to benefits thereby, reversing a longstanding interpretation of the Benefits Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.994" offset="510803">We hold today that the written consent requirement of Section 33(g) applies regardless of whether an injured worker is receiving compensation or has adjudicated to be so entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.903" offset="550405">This is a case of statutory interpretation and our analysis is dictated by the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.151" offset="571408">The employer supported by the Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, the government agency which administers the Act, argues to us that the natural meaning of person entitled of compensation encompasses persons like petitioners who have been injured and are eligible for benefits under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.283" offset="631907">We find great force in that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.595" offset="641207">In normal English usage to be entitled to something used to qualify or have a right to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.815" offset="658030">It does not require that the right be acknowledged or adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.053" offset="670986">Under that natural meaning, petitioner was a person entitled to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.878" offset="686346">Our conclusion is about just by other provisions of the Longshore Act using the phrase person entitled to compensation, many of which would make no sense if the phrase meant what the petitioner contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.776" offset="737860">Petitioner's most powerful argument test is that we should adapt his view because since 1977 the Benefits Review Board has read the language as he does, and in 1984, Congress reenacted the statute without changing the critical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.092" offset="783208">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.535" offset="788955">First, as the petitioner concedes, we owe no deference to the views of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.251" offset="803793">It is the office of workman's compensation programs that is the agency charged with administering the statute, and that agency now argues in favor of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.896" offset="834408">Second, the petitioner's argument is based on a false premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.955" offset="846634">When Congress reenacted the Longshore Act in 1984, it added new provisions and new language which we think leave little doubt that Congress did not intend to adapt the Board's view of the statute and if any thing, it meant to reverse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.297" offset="891982">In any event, administrative interpretation followed by congressional reenactment cannot overcome the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.140" offset="919359">We are concerned that our decision today will have a harsh effect on injured workers and their families when they loose their benefits for failure to comply with Section 33(g), a result which may have been exacerbated by the uncertain course followed by the federal agency's charge with administering the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.316" offset="988113">However, Congress has spoken with great clarity to the precise issue raised in this case and it is the duty of the courts to enforce the judgment of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.371" offset="1020296">If the effects of the law are to be alleviated, that too is within the province of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.262" offset="1039835">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.988" offset="1050807">Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens and Justice O'Connor join.</text>
