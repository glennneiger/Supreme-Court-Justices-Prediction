            <label>Mr. Kenneth H. Hanson</label>
            <text syncTime="52.366" offset="354690">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="55.489" offset="367228">This Court granted a writ of certiorari to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals to review in a sentencing guideline case the sentencing of Joseph N. Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.303" offset="402441">Mr. Williams was indicated, tried, and convicted and sentenced in 1989 in the District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin for violating 18 U.S.C. section 922(g)(1), possession of a firearm having been previously convicted of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.602" offset="455627">The issue before this Court is whether or not in a sentencing guideline case a sentence must be remanded for resentencing if both improper and proper factors were relied upon by the district court in sentencing, or whether such a sentence may be upheld if there are proper factors standing alone that would justify the imposition of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.814" offset="528456">Williams was sentenced in the district court both on improper and proper factors, the 27 months in prison to be followed by a 3-year period of supervised released.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.600" offset="567640">The improper factor that was considered by the district court in this sentencing were arrests that had not resulted in convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.995" offset="597210">There was no litigation, there was nothing determining that these factors were indicative of more serious criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.000" offset="625214">The United States Court of Appeals affirmed the sentence with these improper factors, notwithstanding it stated in its opinion a specific holding that there was error on the part of the district court in considering such sentencing an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.759" offset="676309">Notwithstanding that they affirmed the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.651" offset="691878">It should be noted that arrest records in and of themselves which have not resulted in convictions are prohibited by section 4A1.3 of the guidelines, Sentencing Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.869" offset="752691">The Seventh Circuit stated in its opinion that these arrests not resulting in convictions, whether or not litigated, should not have been considered in the defendant's criminal history points if they were not based upon accurate and reliable evidence of a more significant criminal history.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.499" offset="811205">The district court in its preliminary calculations, this is the preliminary, sir, calculation of the correct applicable sentencing guideline considered the recommendations of the probation office which placed the offense level at 9, criminal history points at 10, and a criminal history category of Roman numeral V, with a resulting sentencing range of 18 to 24 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.054" offset="897410">The district, however, in its final determination of the applicable sentencing guidelines, that's his final determination, what he actually considered it to be, the correct applicable sentencing guideline, decided that the criminal history category was not adequately considered by the probation office and he assessed 3 additional criminal history points, raising the criminal history points to 13 and the criminal history category to 6, with an offense level of 9 and a sentencing range of 21 to 27 months, which was greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.491" offset="1003153">He had previously stated that he was going to assess the sentencing against this defendant based at the highest level, so this raised him up from 24 to 27 months by the inclusion of these 3 additional points.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.017" offset="1045263">But in so doing, in determining the final applicable guideline, the district court misapplied the guidelines by improperly considering, incorrectly applied the sentencing guidelines by improperly considering in sentencing the numerous arrests which had not resulted in convictions and which defendant had never been prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.773" offset="1132303">Here's what the district court said when he did this, this was raising up his 3 points from 10 to 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.977" offset="1157171">The serious criminal conduct reflected in those arrests, the serious criminal conduct reflected in those arrests, coupled with convictions more than 15 years old, both of which are barred by the sentencing guideline, suggested to the court that the defendant's criminal history was significantly more serious than that of most defendants in category V, and the court added 3 criminal history points to the previous criminal history point calculation of 10, resulting in 13 criminal history points, and placed the defendant in category VI with a sentencing range of 24 to 27 months, and by so doing he misapplied the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.026" offset="1281305">4A1.3 does not permit prior arrest records in and of themselves to be considered in sentencing, and the sentencing guidelines in 4A1.1 section A also state that convictions over 15 years old are not to be considered in sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.772" offset="1616299">He steps over that by saying there is permission in certain areas of the sentencing guidelines to consider that type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.926" offset="1640959">But the sentencing guidelines in permitting that specifically states this does not apply to arrest records in and of themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.201" offset="1674082">That's what he's relying on here because there had been no convictions on those arrests.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.511" offset="1735313">That the sentence given was reasonable even though there was a misapplication of the guidelines with regard to the prior arrest record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.672" offset="4775966">Because the district court considered improper factors we must vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.567" offset="4803552">Moreover, this is another case in the Ninth Circuit, because the court statement of reasons contained an improper as well as a proper basis for departure we have no way to determine whether any portion of the sentence was based upon consideration of the improper factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.145" offset="4857782">Where the district court fails to determine the accuracy of the challenged information in the presentence report or to state that it is not relying on such information, the judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.453" offset="4899055">The Tenth Circuit held in the United States v. Zamarripa, 905 F. 2d 337, at page 342, it's a 1989 case in the Tenth Circuit, where one... here's where you go, here's on the one question, where one of two or more stated reasons for the departure is invalid the case must be remanded for resentencing because the reviewing court cannot determine whether the same departure would have resulted absent the improper factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.648" offset="4999783">Consequently you vacate the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.719" offset="5008143">Those, plus Stephenson... now, there's one more case I want to give you before I close on this thing, and it's the only case decided by this Court on the sentencing guideline outside of this one, United States v. Misstreata, 109 Supreme Court 647 at 652, this Court stated the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.405" offset="5098840">The Sentence Reform Act of 1984 makes the Sentencing Commission guidelines binding on the courts although it preserves for the judge the discretion to depart from the guidelines applicable to a particular case if the judge finds an aggravating or mitigating factor is present that the Commission did not adequately consider for formulating, when formulating the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.494" offset="5223183">In other words they are saying that which has been determined by the guidelines is binding on this Court, but it is only in an aggravating and mitigating circumstance in regard to a factor that the Sentencing Commission did not consider in creating the guidelines that permits this departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.782" offset="5324329">In other words the departure has to be based on something outside of a factor that was considered and determined in the guidelines, which has been done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.627" offset="5363721">Arrests not resulting in convictions have been strictly considered and decided by the sentencing guidelines, and convictions more than 15 years old, the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.295" offset="5402383">That's been considered and is part of the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.667" offset="5415862">The only way, according to Misstreata, that you can make that departure is if those factors that they are relying on were not considered by the guidelines, and that's 2, that's 2, that's 3742(f)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.074" offset="5469570">If they have been considered they can't make the departure on that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.028" offset="5489318">That's a good opinion, and it's the opinion of this entire Court, not entire, there was one dissent, but it's a solid opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.491" offset="5515232">They have not followed that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.965" offset="5533099">These factors were determined and considered by the sentencing guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.928" offset="5552952">Misstreata is the final word, I would say, in this particular situation.</text>

            <label>Ms. Amy L. Wax</label>
            <text syncTime="1364.387" offset="5602794">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.511" offset="5627245">Perhaps it's best to begin with the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.243" offset="5646262">In subsection (e) of section 3742 of title 18 we are told that in reviewing a sentence including, in this specific case, a sentence that departs from the guideline, an appellate court must determine whether that sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the guidelines or, in the case of departures, whether the sentence is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.884" offset="5760783">In other words, the Court must ask a number of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.175" offset="5777919">Was there a departure from the guidelines?</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.246" offset="5790249">Did the district court make an error in applying the guidelines in the course of its departure decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.541" offset="5815431">Can it be determined that the misapplication of the guidelines was responsible for the departure, that is was an impermissible consideration the but for cause of the sentencing decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.319" offset="5862556">And finally, was the resulting sentence unreasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.812" offset="5876453">Under subsection (f) if the Court determines that the sentence that was imposed is a result of a misapplication of the guidelines it must remand the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.727" offset="5916159">If the Court cannot make that affirmative determination on the basis of the record then it has to go on to consider whether the sentence, the departure, the decision to depart, and the degree of departure is reasonable, having regard for the remaining valid reasons given by the court, but also the record as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.921" offset="6000900">Now, in the case of departures from the guidelines, this system makes a lot of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.567" offset="6035486">A court is authorized to depart from the guidelines when there are circumstancing, circumstances surrounding the crime that indicate that the severity of the criminal conduct is not reflected in the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.448" offset="6091075">Under the statute sentencing courts are required to give reasons for departing from the guidelines, and very often district judges cite more than one reason for departing from the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.205" offset="6146036">Also on many occasions it is not uncommon for judges to make mistakes in explaining their reasons for a departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.531" offset="6183339">Some of the factors they cite may be valid grounds for departure and others may not be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.187" offset="6209984">It is also not uncommon, however, for departure decisions to be what we might call overdetermined decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.370" offset="6238719">That is very often a judge has more than enough reason to decide to depart from the guidelines, so that not all of the reasons that are mentioned are actually essential to the decision to depart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.280" offset="6298383">Now, given this situation it means in practice that not every mistake that a judge or a court makes in deciding to depart from the guidelines will actually issue in a sentence that needs to be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.141" offset="6365779">If Congress had a rule, in effect an automatic reversal rule whereby every error that a judge makes in the course of applying the guidelines and making a decision to depart requires an automatic remand, in practice that would result in a lot of useless remands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.864" offset="6944652">If you asked the judge when he made the decision what are you considering, he might give all three reasons.</text>
