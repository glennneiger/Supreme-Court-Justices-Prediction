            <text syncTime="6.778" offset="117908">In the first case, I have the judgment of the Court to announce, Wright v. West, 91-542.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.370" offset="144239">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.452" offset="172556">Respondent, Frank West, was convicted of grand larceny in a Virginia Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.706" offset="193663">On direct and state collateral review, the Supreme Court of Virginia rejected West's claim that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to support his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.289" offset="239952">West then sought a writ of habeas corpus from the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia which also rejected West's sufficiency challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.583" offset="285092">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.599" offset="293137">Applying our decision in Jackson versus Virginia, the Court of Appeals correctly recognized that as a matter of due process, evidence is sufficient to support a criminal conviction if after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution any rational trial or fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.381" offset="384357">The Court of Appeals concluded that in this case, the Jackson standard was not met.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.051" offset="407031">We unanimously reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.576" offset="417062">The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and I conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support West's conviction regardless of whether the State Court determination of that question should be reviewed deferentially or de novo on federal habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.163" offset="475472">Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the result; Justice O'Connor has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens have joined; Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter also have filed opinions concurring in the judgment.</text>
