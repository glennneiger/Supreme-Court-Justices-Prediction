            <text syncTime="59.554" offset="382593">At issue in the Cowart case is the statutory construction of section 33(g), sections 1 and 2, of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act as amended-in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.768" offset="435465">The question presented to this Court is whether Cowart's entitlement to additional compensation, or what is called deficiency compensation, is terminated because he failed to obtain written permission from his employer, Nicklos Drilling, prior to the settlement of a third party claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.041" offset="520624">The Court is presented with four separate issues to decide in resolving the Cowart case.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.631" offset="550926">One is what is the meaning of a person entitled to compensation under section 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.846" offset="583841">It has been interpreted to mean a person who is under an order of compensation or a person who has been, who is receiving compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.545" offset="630548">The second issue would be what are the effects of the 1984 amendments to the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act with reference to section 33(g)(2), which added a notice provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.084" offset="704735">The third issue would be whether, pursuant to the authority of the Sellman decision from the Fourth Circuit, when an employer participates in the settlement process of the third party settlement, does that relieve the employee of obtaining written permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.371" offset="797940">And fourthly, the question would be whether Mr. Cowart's settlement was in fact for an amount less than compensation to which he was entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.382" offset="853947">The Court, if it resolves any of these issues in favor of Mr. Cowart, would then have to reverse the Fifth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.432" offset="978185">That case could obviate the necessity of a very intensive discussion of what the '84 amendments meant and what the legislative history intended with regard to the application of 33(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="225.142" offset="1044954">The Sellman decision simply stated that when the employer participates in the settlement process 33(g) is not triggered, meaning there is no necessity for the written permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.356" offset="1109842">This is a different concept than the estoppel concept that was addressed in the 1972 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.383" offset="1141921">The Court in Sellman simply says 33(g) is inapplicable to the application of 33(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="256.991" offset="1172327">The Court really doesn't go far enough, because if we resort to the simple plain language of the statute with regard to whether permission is required of an employer, all we need look at is the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.514" offset="1250485">The language of the statute states if the person entitled to compensation enters into a settlement with a third person, when we have an employer such as Nicklos Drilling who not only waived subrogation, had an indemnification provision, had a provision to defend the third party, actually funded the settlement, how can that be construed to be a settlement with a third person?</text>

            <text syncTime="457.940" offset="1976167">--That goes to the interpretation of what a person entitled to comp is and what the meaning of the amendments are.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.766" offset="2007514">My interpretation that is submitted is the same interpretation that the Benefits Review Board held in Kahny, in Dorsey, in Pinell.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.900" offset="2048056">That interpretation is that Congress in 1984 reenacted word for word section 33(g)(1), which mirrors the prior 33(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="491.520" offset="2110541">That interpretation was first gave meaning in O'Leary, the O'Leary decision, which held that a person entitled to compensation is merely, is solely a person who is either under an order of compensation or who is currently receiving compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.791" offset="2199566">Congress reenacted word for word 33(g) that had been given the interpretation by the Benefits Review Board and by the Ninth Circuit in the unpublished O'Leary decision and by the Kahny decision in a unpublished Fifth Circuit decision that does have precedential value.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.471" offset="2282322">The additional provision of section 33(g)(2) applies to employee, and in fact if you read the language in 33(g)(1) the language is a person entitled to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.497" offset="2350345">The language in 33(g)(2) deviates from that and says an employee, and it says if no written approval of the settlement is obtained and filed as required by paragraph 1, the pre-84 statute, or if the employee fails to notify the employer of any settlement obtained from or judgment rendered against a third person, all rights to the compensation, medical benefits under this chapter shall be terminated, and then the language you're concerned with is regardless of whether the employer or the employer's insurer has made payments or acknowledged entitlement to benefits under this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.401" offset="2510005">That section relates to employees, which is a class that covers all injured employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.539" offset="2538531">It covers injured employees who settle cases for less than their amount, for more than.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.943" offset="2564131">It covers injured employees who are receiving compensation and who are not receiving compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.519" offset="2582521">It covers employees who settle for more than or less than.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.189" offset="2601121">It covers the entire class, and it's read to go very neatly with that class because it encompasses everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.045" offset="2636543">But section (2) only requires notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.090" offset="2652739">What I submit to the Court is what Congress did was in section (1) adopt the statute as it was understood to mean through a long string of cases, of BRB cases, which was the understanding and the position of the Director of what the meaning was, and Congress was very fearful and they stated in legislative history of these quiet, secret settlements where no notice is offered to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.294" offset="2801637">So the employer may be refusing to pay compensation, but he still has his subrogation rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.820" offset="2839671">He still has his credit rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.539" offset="2846567">But how can he enforce them?</text>
            <text syncTime="677.445" offset="2854195">He can only enforce them if he has notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.193" offset="2865166">This is specifically a concern of Congress, and Congress enacted this provision to protect the employer from that specific situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="706.761" offset="2971432">My, the interpretation that I submit to the Court is that regardless clause refers to employees who fail to notify.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.661" offset="3015005">Section (2) is reiterating in that first statement, if no written approval of the settlement is obtained as filed, required by paragraph (1).</text>

            <text syncTime="736.592" offset="3090760">In fact the Fifth Circuit in its ruling essentially rewrote this statute to replace or with and.</text>

            <text syncTime="835.396" offset="3486045">Now there is a very lengthy legislative history that lends to that interpretation, and in fact it is discussed quite extensively by this Court in Bloomer, and it goes through the interpretation, the historical interpretation of how that came about.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.594" offset="4018734">This Director has done so, and in 1984 if Congress amends the act to state O'Leary is overruled without a prospective application, they would take hundreds of thousands of injured, disabled workers, widows, and terminate their compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1193.724" offset="4919331">It says there are no exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.302" offset="4925601">But there's a misunderstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.864" offset="4931870">The Fifth Circuit said there are no exceptions, and I basically agree with that, even if that was in O'Leary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.970" offset="4956321">But there are no exceptions when it's a person entitled to comp, meaning a person either receiving benefits or under an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.233" offset="4985369">Then there are no exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.264" offset="4989444">And that is what the Fifth Circuit should have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.607" offset="4998848">But what they did is they rewrote the statute to conform with their meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.293" offset="5021627">They took the or in subsection (2) and made it into an and, and the other thing they did was they rewrote, they wrote out any settlement out of the act and said section, the notice requirement only applies to judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.427" offset="5078156">Then respondents, amicus respondents and Federal respondents, are suggesting to this Court that if we're going to give meaning to it we can't write out settlements because any settlement is clearly written in subpart (2), but what we can do is say any settlement means only settlements for more than what the employer would have been entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.792" offset="5175540">And of course that flies in the face of the clear language that says any settlements, meaning settlements for less than or more than.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.227" offset="5209290">And that also flies in the face of what is the forfeiture penalty if you settle for more than, unless, and this brings us to a crucial point, unless we look at the application of 33(g) to a determined amount of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.702" offset="5291210">And this is the way Congress envisioned it in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.560" offset="5314616">In 1959 when they amended the act to give the employer not an election of remedies but the employer could receive compensation and elect to pursue a third-party claim, the legislative history indicates, and it is cited by Federal respondent in their brief at page 21, that there was this envision by Congress that the employer would be receiving compensation and it would be a determined amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.093" offset="5448781">Now, this is what Mobley said in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.560" offset="5462678">Mobley involved, which is a recorded case, Mobley involved a decision where someone with asbestosis was, filed a third-party suit, had his claim, settled his case, but he was not currently disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.805" offset="5527671">He was not currently disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.866" offset="5539896">The Court in Mobley says we don't terminate your right to future compensation, we don't terminate your right to medicals because you settled for an amount more than what is the determined amount of compensation due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.999" offset="5608441">To have a clear understanding we have to look at what happened in '27.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.371" offset="5629862">In '27 the employer had to choose one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.495" offset="5646371">He had to accept compensation, and if he did he assigned his right to the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.919" offset="5768102">What was happening is, in 1927 to 1938 the employer would pay compensation for a brief period of time, receive the full assignment of the rights of the employee to the third-party claim, terminate compensation, then you had an employee who was not receiving compensation and had no third-party claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.427" offset="5854097">In 1938 Congress amended the act to say that the employer would only receive the assignment under section 33(b) if there was an order of compensation rendered by the deputy commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.591" offset="5926822">That's where this concept that the Director had under an order compensation first surfaced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1453.759" offset="5959423">That was the only time there was an assignment of benefits under section (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.196" offset="5977186">The Director and the respondents suggest that we have to read section (g) with section (f), section (g) meaning the requirement of permission, with section (f), the right of recoupment and credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.986" offset="6044373">And they say that we have to read that together and we have to give a person entitled to compensation and mean the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.671" offset="6067047">Section (f) specifically references section (b), which talks about when the assignment takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.823" offset="6103723">If we read section (f) with section (b), the only time an assignment takes place under the law as it is today is when there is a formal order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.069" offset="6144683">This Court has said that in Palace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.241" offset="6157326">In Palace the Court has said that only under a formal order is there an assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.894" offset="6183971">And the respondent suggests that we must interpret section (f) and (g) in the same light.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.460" offset="7066283">In 1985 when the suit was filed in Federal court in New Orleans by the claimant I had two problems I was facing on behalf of my client, Nicklos Drilling Company, and its insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.954" offset="7124275">Number one was, of course, that we had our compensation liability to the claimant who was our employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.640" offset="7150920">Number two, we were looking at a contractual indemnity claim brought against us by Transco Exploration Company, the third party which the claimant had sued in Federal court in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.682" offset="7191148">And they had a hold harmless that ran in their favor with respect to claims brought by our employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.600" offset="7218838">I thought I saw a way to resolve both of those problems with one fell swoop, and that was by negotiating and funding through Transco a third-party settlement of Mr. Cowart's claim arising out of his injury that he sustained in 1983, and thereby not only concluding our problems with Transco, but also closing the books on the Department of Labor's case with respect to Mr. Cowart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.513" offset="7322492">And I looked at 933(g) and I sure thought that told me that I could do exactly what I wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.964" offset="7348301">And of course this wasn't the only case in which this had been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.259" offset="7365437">This has been a practice for many years for employers to conclude their liability through contributing to third-party settlements, through taking the benefits of third-party settlements, and it seems to me evident that the Congress has always recognized, and 33(g) is intended to recognize, that lump sum settlements of tort claims against third parties constitute an acceptable manner of providing compensation for injured workers in lieu of the workers' compensation scheme where those remedies are available.</text>
