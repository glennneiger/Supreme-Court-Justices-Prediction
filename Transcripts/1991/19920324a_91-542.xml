            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150609">We'll hear argument next in No. 91-542, Ellis B. Wright v. Frank Robert West.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.149" offset="195122">Mr. Curry, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_r_curry" startTime="69.616" stopTime="192.426">
            <label>Mr. Donald R. Curry</label>
            <text syncTime="69.616" offset="428970">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="79.494" offset="468571">What this case is all about is whether this Court meant what it said in Teague v. Lane and its progeny about having confidence in the state courts to faithfully follow the Constitution and about Federal habeas courts deferring to reasonable good faith state court judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.617" offset="552999">West and his amici complain that we are trying to take the Federal courts out of the formula by which habeas corpus cases are decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.384" offset="596049">Nothing could be farther from the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.605" offset="604931">We are not asking for a rule of preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.819" offset="621858">All we are asking is that the Court make explicitly clear that the state courts are an important part of that calculus too, and that Federal habeas courts are not free to decide the cases of state prisoners as if the state court decision had never even occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.430" offset="696255">In a system where Congress has expressly required that a state prisoner first take his constitutional claims to state court before bringing them to Federal court, it makes absolutely no sense to then turn around on Federal habeas corpus and completely disregard the state court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.194" offset="783295">The problem that exists is that Federal collateral relief, with all of the systemic costs that this Court has identified, is still being granted not because the state court decision was indefensible, not because it was objectively unreasonable under existing precedent, but simply because a Federal habeas court thinks in its opinion that its decision is right and that the decisions of all the state courts that went before were wrong.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="192.426" offset="920281">Then why don't you simply argue that this is a misapplication or a failure to apply Teague by in effect applying a new rule or a new and more specific application of the, of, as it were, of Jackson, of any rule attacking the unexplained possession theory, that it arose after the date of conviction and therefore it shouldn't be applied under Teague?</text>
            <text syncTime="217.744" offset="1021531">Why do we have to get into a separate category of mixed law and fact?</text>

            <text syncTime="220.877" offset="1034070">Of course, Justice Souter, that's exactly what we are arguing, and that's exactly the question that we raised in the court below.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="228.239" offset="1063536">But you don't really need, then, a separate, or a specific rule for mixed questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.594" offset="1084957">All you need is a, in effect a clear statement, or a clearer statement perhaps, of when Teague applies and when it doesn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.439" offset="1116304">Well, it's certainly true, Justice Souter, that we should win under a correct application of Teague.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.395" offset="1144098">But the point of this case as we see it at this juncture in view of the Court's question that it asked when certiorari was granted is whether Teague in effect has taken the Jackson standard, which is a very deferential standard, and in effect applied it across the board and made it the standard of review.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="271.649" offset="1237198">Well, suppose the court had not instructed the jury with reference to the inference, and it just submitted the case to the jury, and we later find out from say closing argument of counsel or by examining the jurors after the verdict that the jurors did indeed rely on this inference as a common sense inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.424" offset="1328209">Could the petitioner then ask the Federal court for review based on the theory that the evidence was insufficient?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald R. Curry</label>

            <text syncTime="305.600" offset="1372931">And I think it is, the common law inference is just a recognition of what is common sense.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="313.307" offset="1403755">But habeas review would then lie in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="315.747" offset="1413577">You may win, you may lose, but the Court would, in your view, have the right to exercise its jurisdiction to determine sufficiency of the evidence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_r_curry" startTime="327.746" stopTime="335.901">
            <label>Mr. Donald R. Curry</label>
            <text syncTime="327.746" offset="1461538">Justice Kennedy, we have never, we have never contended that sufficiency of the evidence claims are not reviewable in habeas corpus.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="335.901" offset="1494139">So it's just the presence of the inference in this case that makes Federal, the exercise of Federal jurisdiction inappropriate?</text>

            <text syncTime="352.653" offset="1561221">We contended below that we should win under a straight out application of Jackson, and we should win under a straight out application of Jackson.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="363.913" offset="1606256">Whether or not it's appropriate for the Federal Court to exercise its authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.625" offset="1625065">If Teague applies, then I take it it is inappropriate?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald R. Curry</label>
            <text syncTime="372.368" offset="1640007">--Well, it is appropriate under Teague and Jackson to the extent that the Federal court looks at whether the decision reached by the decision-maker is one that a reasonable decision-maker could have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.637" offset="1705104">And that is the inquiry under Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.571" offset="1720882">It is also the inquiry under Teague.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="395.352" stopTime="421.820">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="395.352" offset="1731958">Well, isn't that a little bit of an elision of some of the factors in Teague, that the only question is was the state court decision reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.561" offset="1780754">If it's simply an application of existing constitutional law to the facts of a case, it isn't enough that the state court decision be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.688" offset="1825267">It really has to be correct, doesn't it?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Donald R. Curry</label>
            <text syncTime="421.820" offset="1837806">I don't think that's what Teague means.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.671" offset="1849195">And I think what the Court just said a few weeks ago in Stringer makes that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.775" offset="1865705">The Court said in Stringer that the Teague doctrine, the interest of federalism underlying that doctrine, are equally undermined when you apply a new rule, in other words apply an after-decided case, and it is equally undermined when you take settled law and apply it in a way that is not dictated by precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.200" offset="1959327">And that's exactly what we're contending should have been the standard in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="456.563" stopTime="473.254">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="456.563" offset="1976777">But every single fact situation isn't an original inquiry under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.627" offset="1997048">I mean, there are settled principles of law that apply to different fact situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.123" offset="2035082">You would agree with that, wouldn't you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_r_curry" startTime="473.254" stopTime="507.956">
            <label>Mr. Donald R. Curry</label>
            <text syncTime="473.254" offset="2043546">Well, I agree that there are situations where you take a settled principle and you apply it to the facts of a case, but I don't think that makes any difference for purposes of the Teague inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.980" offset="2086491">After all, in Butler v. McKellar he, the petitioner in that case, the prisoner in that case first said that he was relying on the Roberson decision which was an after-decided case.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.639" offset="2133094">And when clearly he could not do that under Teague, his answer to that was all I am asking the Court to do is to take Edwards v. Arizona and apply it to the facts of my case, and I should win.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="507.956" stopTime="533.005">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="507.956" offset="2182413">There are going to be gray areas where there is argument as to whether this was fore-ordained by prior decisions or whether it's an expansion under Teague, but you can certainly have some issues or some fact situations which, although not precisely covered by a prior constitutional decision, nonetheless would not be regarded as a new rule, can you not?</text>

          <turn speaker="donald_r_curry" startTime="533.005" stopTime="551.129">
            <label>Mr. Donald R. Curry</label>
            <text syncTime="533.005" offset="2282619">Mr. Chief Justice, I think the answer to that question, that question would be answered by applying the Teague test.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.690" offset="2309368">If it's, if the fact situation is close enough, then the result was dictated by precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.045" offset="2338730">If the fact situation is not close enough, then it was not dictated by precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.459" offset="2356389">Well now take the case where the fact situation was close enough to be dictated by prior precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.572" offset="2376869">In that case it's not enough that the state court decision be, quote, reasonable, close quote.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.869" offset="2478015">The way I see it is that when you, if you say that the result was not dictated by precedent, then by definition under the Teague standard the result that the state court reached was not reasonable under existing precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.040" offset="2718759">I think if a Federal habeas court decided the case under Jackson and found that no rational jury could have reached this conclusion, it is simply impossible to say that the same Federal court would look at it under Teague and say well, even though the jury acted irrationally I have to find that a reasonable state court could have affirmed that irrational verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="964.841" offset="4009940">And what this case all boils down to is how much does this Court trust the state courts, and whether this Court has meant it in the past when it has said that it does have that confidence in the state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="987.666" offset="4101264">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="994.020" offset="4126655">The United States takes the position that Teague does not itself mandate an application of a deferential standard of review to mixed questions of law and fact, that instead it and its progeny seem to suggest that settled questions of law can be applied to the facts, and it has not yet changed the standard of review that would govern those determinations by the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.398" offset="4232189">What we ask this Court to do, however, is to reevaluate whether that standard of review in fact conforms to the purposes of the writ, because for the last 16 years in a series of decisions starting with Wainwright v. Sykes, Francis v. Henderson, and all the way through Coleman v. Thompson, what this Court has said is that when looking at rules governing the scope of the writ we need to weigh the costs in terms of finality and comity against the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.698" offset="4353398">And those benefits are generally viewed in terms of whether they are necessary, whether the rule is necessary to advance the fundamental deterrent and remedial purposes of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.918" offset="4398224">We submit that, for the same kinds of reasons that led the Court in Teague and Butler to change the standard of review in effect that is applicable to state determinations of questions of law, this Court should also now find that it is appropriate to use a deferential standard of review for mixed questions of fact and law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1807.486" offset="7380467">I think if no instruction had been given here at all and the jury had returned a verdict of guilty, they would be arguing that there is an inference to be drawn from the fact that he was in possession of these goods and that that was enough to convict this person beyond a reasonable doubt, and we would be arguing the same things we have been arguing all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.136" offset="7439086">I don't think this is an instruction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.627" offset="7449117">And I think the answer to that partially, and again to avoid the problem of announcing a new rule here, my authority for that is Ulster County Court v. Allen, which was decided I believe 2 weeks before Jackson v. Virginia, that recognized that the instruction, an instruction like this may be given under a more likely than not standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1899.957" offset="7750361">One is that the possessor obtain the goods as the thief, the person who took them from the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.829" offset="7769900">The other, more widely recognized and I think in most of the authorities considered stronger, is that the person who has possession of those stolen goods knew them to be stolen when they gained possession of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.167" offset="7815249">The difference between the two is, in the complaint that we have here is not only did Virginia ask the jury to draw from his possession the fact that he came by the goods unlawfully, but that he at least 2 weeks earlier was at a certain place at a certain time and took them in a certain way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.728" offset="7873450">In Virginia they would use this inference, since they could reasonably show that the theft took place at the same time as the burglary, to convict of burglary or robbery or what have you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.323" offset="12603807">Yes, subject only to the qualification that I truly believe a fair reading of the opinion is that they were invalidating the conviction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.610" offset="12641006">They were not invalidating the inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.000" offset="12646544">That is what they say at the end of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.532" offset="12652709">When they talk in terms of the inference not being as strong as it was, they're referring to comments including Lord Hale, some several hundred years ago, as to the strength of the inference dissipating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.087" offset="12690952">It wasn't something that happened in the last 10 years or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.540" offset="12700669">They went into a historical analysis that itself challenges the ability of this inference particularly to distinguish how someone came into possession of the goods, which is the way it was used here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.055" offset="12742779">Ultimately I think the two issues that are correctly before the Court are, one, is the decision by the Fourth Circuit not reasonable but is it correct application of law, and two, whether or not it announced a new rule by application of Jackson, which of course if it did it would be Teague-barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.395" offset="12808189">Those are the questions that I think that are properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.828" offset="12817907">We submit that this isn't a novel application of Jackson v. Virginia, and that no precedent was extended by virtue of the decision, and any language in the Fourth Circuit opinion that is read otherwise is dicta and was not central to any decision that it reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.207" offset="12875376">That was the whole battle we went through below, was are we attacking the inference or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.320" offset="12891886">And then there was briefing and rebriefing of that issue because I think the court recognized it couldn't announce a new rule that the inference was not valid and could not be used in Virginia except for purposes of how it was used in this particular case as a matter of evidential sufficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.161" offset="12951236">And finally I would simply suggest that those I think are the proper issues that are before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.574" offset="12972865">The question of standard of review is not a Teague question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.856" offset="12986031">Standard of review cases are not even discussed in Teague.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.710" offset="13001391">Mixed law, fact and law questions are subject to Teague in the sense that I have just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.001" offset="13018527">If this is an extension of Jackson, as this Court has defined it, then it is Teague-barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.686" offset="13037336">But to suggest that all mixed questions and all state court decisions that are reasonable, quote, unquote, must be upheld by the Federal habeas court flies in the face of this Court's understanding of the statute, overrules cases that are not even mentioned in Teague, and is ultimately a question, as has been addressed in many of the amici briefs, for Congress to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.628" offset="13117061">Whether there is independent review or not is a congressional decision because of the weighing of so many different factors as to whether or not we need Federal habeas review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.494" offset="13152483">I would submit that it has been the Court's understanding since 1953 that this is a question that has already been decided by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.480" offset="13188428">This case is not affected by that line of authority at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.791" offset="13197727">If there are no further questions, that concludes my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="3275.053" offset="13250808">I'd just like to make three or four brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.375" offset="13264078">I don't want to be misunderstood about what I said in answer to Justice Kennedy's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.817" offset="13281842">What I meant to say and what I think I said was the fact that the instruction was given doesn't mean that the jury couldn't have drawn the inference in the absence of the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.153" offset="13327190">But I think it's important that the instruction was given here because the instruction, this was not, this is not a common law inference that allows you to infer an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.160" offset="13363239">This is an instruction that allows you to infer guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.572" offset="13376823">It says you can infer theft from these facts.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="3311.246" offset="13395527">It says that the inference, taking into consideration the whole evidence, is sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="3316.942" offset="13418305">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.113" offset="13423007">And the evidence here, of course, was that, the Fourth Circuit admitted that the basic facts were there to properly instruct the jury as to recent possession--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3328.272" stopTime="3328.762">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3328.272" offset="13463654">Right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald R. Curry</label>
            <text syncTime="3328.762" offset="13465639">--plus he falsely testified about his involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.783" offset="13477656">But I think it's a bit disingenuous to say that they're not attacking the instruction or the common law inference under those circumstances, because obviously if you tell the jury that they can draw the inference based on these facts and then you say well, if you do your verdict will be overturned, in effect you are challenging the inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.146" offset="13563128">The second point I'd like to make is that a point was raised about Virginia's standard of review and not knowing what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.951" offset="13590400">I think that's interesting since they have never said in 12 years of litigation that Virginia may have applied the wrong standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.304" offset="13611820">The fact of the matter is that Virginia applies a more stringent standard than Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.728" offset="13629479">Under Virginia law the evidence must exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.371" offset="13648078">This Court recognized that in the Jackson decision itself.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3377.783" offset="13661662">Is that only where the case is based on circumstantial evidence?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald R. Curry</label>
            <text syncTime="3382.805" offset="13681829">That's right, when it's based solely on circumstantial evidence, like this one was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.199" offset="13691337">And to answer a point that Justice Scalia raised, this is of course a general rule case, and I think a basic juxtaposition here shows this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.106" offset="13742955">If the decision by the Fourth Circuit in this case was in fact a decision of this Court that had been rendered in 1985, say, well then West would have come to the Federal habeas court and said insufficiency of the evidence, I win under that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.760" offset="13817561">And the Federal habeas court would have had to say no, you don't get the benefit of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.671" offset="13837205">It was decided after your case became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.114" offset="13847027">His only recourse would be to say the result was dictated by preexisting precedent at the time my conviction became final, in other words Jackson v. Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.662" offset="13893211">And that's exactly our point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.052" offset="13898749">The result, this case is governed by Teague, and unless it can be said, and it cannot be said in view of the common law inference which has existed for centuries, that the result in this case was dictated by precedent at the time his conviction became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.952" offset="13958413">Finally with regard to this business of congressional intent, I think the best evidence that there is no congressional mandate for de novo review is this Court's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.458" offset="14000418">In case after case in the last 15 years this Court has afforded state prisoners something far less than de novo review, and in many instances no review at all in default cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.846" offset="14049946">And the, in each of those cases, in each of those line of cases the Court reached that conclusion over a dissent which made the congressional intent argument, and of course the Court necessarily rejected that view in order to hold the way that it did.</text>
