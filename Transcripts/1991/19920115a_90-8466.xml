            <text syncTime="24.318" offset="241994">The main issue in this case is is it constitutional for a State to forcibly medicate a defendant on the claim that he would become incompetent, when there is scarcely any evidence to show that he would become incompetent without the medication, and when his best defense is, in fact his only defense, was that he was insane at the time of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.746" offset="347737">This case also raises the related issue whether it is constitutional for a State to forcibly medicate a capital defendant in the sentencing phase when the two mitigating factors that he was going to present were the fact that (1) he suffers from a mental disease or defect, and (2) whether he shows any remorse.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.983" offset="464661">And if it is constitutional to forcibly medicate this defendant, did the State use the least restrictive alternative available?</text>
            <text syncTime="90.668" offset="507398">David Riggins, 10 months prior to the offense, was found wandering the street of Glendora, California, in his underwear at 2:00 a.m. When he was hospitalized, he stated that he was the son of John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe, and that the mafia was seeking him because he had stock in IBM.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.736" offset="6395711">The way this issue was initially presented to the trial court was really a question of trial strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.884" offset="6460286">There was never an indication in this case that Mr. Riggins was a Harper-type defendant who did not want to be medicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.224" offset="6493618">The testimony at the evidentiary hearing reveals that Mr. Riggins was admitted into the county jail right after his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.113" offset="6521203">Shortly after being incarcerated, he complained of hearing voices and having trouble sleeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.798" offset="6539907">And on the basis of that interview with the jail psychiatrist and... at which time he took a short medical history from the defendant... at which time he learned that Mr. Riggins had previously been medicated with Mellaril some 6 years earlier by Dr. O'Gorman and that the drug had worked effectively for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.277" offset="6601869">The psychiatrist then prescribed a moderate dose of Mellaril, which was primarily designed to control anxiety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.086" offset="6633112">Over the course of the next several months, the dosage was increased four or five times.</text>

            <text syncTime="2953.486" offset="11958748">This was Mr. Riggins' desire to stop unwanted medication.</text>

            <text syncTime="2990.598" offset="12107123">And the court denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.065" offset="12112975">There were 10 weeks at the time of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.300" offset="12121961">As it turns out, there were 16 weeks prior to trial because of a conflict I had in another case.</text>
