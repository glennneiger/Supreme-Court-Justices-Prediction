            <text syncTime="39.316" offset="287997">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="53.017" offset="342750">This case addresses the applicability of the Equal Access to Justice Act, or the EAJA, to deportation hearings before an immigration judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.621" offset="381202">More particularly, this case deals with 5 U.S.C. Section 504, that prong of the EAJA that applies to administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.969" offset="422580">And those proceedings, in order to be eligible for EAJA fees, the Government must be represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.093" offset="451106">In this case, the Government, the Immigration Service, was represented by their trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.809" offset="473884">In addition, it is required that the statute say that this proceeding be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.543" offset="504813">It must be determined on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.676" offset="513382">That is the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.797" offset="517875">And in addition, the position of the Government must be not even substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.842" offset="542012">Here the Immigration Service produced no evidence at all in support of its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.857" offset="566149">The EAJA was enacted to further specific purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.861" offset="586107">One was to aid victims, to help avoid the situation where someone might have to surrender their rights and succumb to unjustified Government action just because of the expense of hiring an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.952" offset="642531">Mrs. Ardestani's petition for asylum was wrongfully denied and she was unjustifiably placed in deportation proceedings, proceedings so complex and with consequences so harsh, that it was necessary for her to engage an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.192" offset="707419">Another specific purpose of the EAJA statute is to deter unjustified Government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.436" offset="732392">And that's done by holding the agency itself accountable.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.400" offset="752245">The Service did not dispute the Secretary of State's determination that Mrs. Ardestani had a well-founded fear of persecution were she to be returned to Iran under the Khomeini regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.637" offset="801251">Instead, the Service unwarrantedly asserted that Mrs. Ardestani had firmly resettled in a third country.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.814" offset="833956">They asserted that even though she had been in a third country for only 3 days, staying in--</text>

            <text syncTime="186.741" offset="877633">What we're talking about here is whether a deportation proceeding is an adjudication under Section 554 for purposes of the EAJA?</text>

            <text syncTime="195.529" offset="912846">--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.679" offset="921414">The EAJA provides broadly for protection for people who have been subjected to severe agency misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.114" offset="955164">And of all the possible Government agencies, and of all the possible agency proceedings, deportation proceedings are the ones that most specifically meet the EAJA context.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.655" offset="1017336">They're the ones where the most harsh consequences meted out by any agency are meted out... consequences that may be tantamount to banishment or exile, or in the words of Justice Brandeis,</text>
            <text syncTime="236.455" offset="1076477">"the loss of life and property and all that makes life worth living. "</text>
            <text syncTime="240.248" offset="1091628">This is particularly so in the context of asylum where, as here, it had been determined that the refugee would be subjected to persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.576" offset="1133006">Moreover, persons in deportation proceedings are the very people for whom the remedial measures of the EAJA most perfectly are met.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.423" offset="1176369">Mr. Soloway, I mean, that's all... yes, I mean, it's very sympathetic, but the fact is even in criminal trials, when someone is wrongly prosecuted, and it turns out there was no basis for the prosecution, EAJA does not reimburse the wrongfully prosecuted criminal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.045" offset="1250871">Although he may have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on his defense, he's not reimbursed, is he?</text>

            <text syncTime="292.687" offset="1301444">There are some very touching situations that are not reimbursed.</text>

            <label>Mr. David N. Soloway</label>
            <text syncTime="300.854" offset="1334149">This statute says that adversary adjudications, that is the adjudications for which EAJA applies, are those that are under Section 554.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.832" offset="1382005">554&gt; ["] is a term that has been the focus of the various circuit courts, and it's a term upon which the majority and the dissentient court below focused.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.822" offset="1441982">It's an ordinary, common preposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.794" offset="1453894">It's a word with perhaps as many as 25 meanings as a preposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.558" offset="1472911">In order for this Court to properly glean the correct meaning of the definition 554&gt; ["], it's necessary for this Court to look at the entire statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.407" offset="1528291">This Court has held that interpretation of a statute is not an inert exercise in grammatical or literary composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.032" offset="1570818">Instead, we have to look at what was the EAJA statute about.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.396" offset="1588268">And, Justice Scalia, I think it's important to understand the way that deportation hearings are precisely those that fit that statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.046" offset="1646887">554&gt; ["], those words are merely a cross reference to the definitional provisions in Section 554.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.483" offset="1684608">It merely means that Congress was cross-referencing and importing into the statute the definition in Section 554.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.888" offset="1726195">That definition requires... that definition provides that a statute must require that the hearing be determined on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.906" offset="1766319">In addition, there are six express exemptions, none of which arguably are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.341" offset="1800069">Confronted by a foreign language, confronted by the most harsh consequences meted out, confronted by a strange culture where the necessity of having a lawyer be involved are at its apex, deportation proceedings are most precisely in concert with the EAJA provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.611" offset="1965163">I mean, we've analogized them on occasion... being deported to criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.737" offset="1993584">And if they're analogized to that rather than other 554 proceedings, then there'd be no compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.824" offset="2025976">Your Honor, of course, if they were tantamount to criminal proceedings, were this Court to so hold, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel may be invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.302" offset="2059935">The... that's not something that's being urged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.432" offset="2076444">As a matter of fact, here particularly, we're talking about someone who has engaged counsel at their own expense and merely a fee shifting in those adversary adjudications where the Government has been abusive.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="500.113" stopTime="504.164">

            <text syncTime="500.113" offset="2131093">--Of course the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is not a right to have counsel paid for.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.164" offset="2147393">Well, I'm talking about appointed counsel, yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.518" offset="2168709">Your Honor, if I understood your earlier question correctly, you were suggesting that were these to be viewed as criminal proceedings, deportation proceedings, because they mete out consequences that may be as harsh or harsher than many criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.381" offset="2252196">What seems to follow is that perhaps a person, an indigent person, is entitled to appointed counsel under the Sixth Amendment, although the Ardestani case doesn't specifically require this Court to address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.001" offset="2306740">However, in looking at the statutory scheme and in understanding what this statute means, it's helpful to note that in the legislative history there was a change in the Senate bill from 554&gt; ["], and the joint explanatory statement of the conference committee, which may be particularly probative because it represents the views of both the House and Congress, stated that adversary adjudications were those, and I quote, are defined under the Administrative Procedures Act, where the agency takes a position through representation by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.389" offset="2472252">But it's probably a lot more instructive for this court to note that there were no discussions about whether or not different agencies, different categories of agencies were to be within the scope of EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.511" offset="2528781">Instead, EAJA was a broad remedial statute, and the discussions were about categories of proceedings, those that were... pardon me... trial like, versus those that are rule making or price fix... rate fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.491" offset="2600670">In addition to that, in order to get... to understand the meaning of the common preposition under, in this particular instance, the EAJA, on its face, recognizes the Administrative Conference of the United States as an authority on the EAJA implementation.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.453" offset="2848520">More important than the rejection of the Senate language EAJA recognized the ACUS as an authority on the subject of the EAJA, and there the chairman stated that questions of EAJA's coverage should turn on substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.145" offset="2995223">The fact that a party has endured the burden and expense of a formal hearing, rather than technicalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.880" offset="3022182">This is particularly important because that's precisely what we're faced with here... a suggestion that a hyper-technical interpretation of the word EAJA statute to those particularly in need of the statute is to be compared to the functional and more appropriate interpretation as "as defined in"... in other words, just mere importation, a cross-reference of those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.741" offset="3137643">And for that reason, the burden should be on the Government to show that the Congress intended not to have merely a cross-reference to import those definitional words, but the Government really should have the burden to show that Congress intended to cover and protect people from all sorts of agency adjudications, but not those particularly in need of it in deportation proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.757" offset="10713676">And in at least two decisions of last term that come to mind, the United States against Dolm, and OPM against Richmond, the Court emphasized that this is the essence of the legislative function under our constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.491" offset="10784624">And in any event, it was the well-established principal at the time Congress was drafting EAJA and that established the rules of statutory draftsmanship under which Congress put together this text, with its definition section specifying the proceedings for which fee-shifting would be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.070" offset="10890995">So that is the proper way to read the statutory text, and it was equally well established at the time this statute was drafted by this Court's 1955 decision in Marcello against Bonds, that administrative deportation proceedings are not proceedings governed by Section 554 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
