            <label>Mr. Theodore E. Meckler</label>
            <text syncTime="89.474" offset="488573">Fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.291" offset="491812">That's what I'll do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.676" offset="497350">Moving then to the second question presented, which is, does section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act create a Federal cause of action under which a union member may sue his union for violation of the union constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.186" offset="563387">And this is a case where the words of the statute mean something.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.940" offset="590450">And what they mean is that a cause of action is created in this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.778" offset="621797">Now, the language of the statute in pertinent part are as follows; suits for violations of contracts between an employer and a labor organization or between any such labor organizations may be brought in any district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.990" offset="694626">The first question that must be answered, of course, is whether a union constitution is a 301 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.096" offset="727018">And that question has been answered already by this Court in the affirmative in the Plumbers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.999" offset="746662">The second question which we then must move on to is, can a nonsignatory to a 301 contract between unions sue to remedy a violation of that contract, and can they sue under 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.663" offset="829314">And in essence, I think the Court has also answered that question in Smith v. Evening News, and answered it in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.519" offset="864736">Admittedly, Smith v. Evening News dealt with the other half of this statute, the two halves being contracts between a labor organization and an employer and contracts between labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.063" offset="934848">Smith held that when we're talking about contracts between a labor organization and an employer, a nonsignatory who in that case who had benefits arising out of that contract could bring suit against the employer in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.644" offset="1017186">The same principle is just as applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.429" offset="1032337">There is no language in the statute that suggests any basis for differentiation in the treatment of collective bargaining agreements, the first type of statute... excuse me, the first type of contract defined in this statute, and union constitutions, the second type of contract defined in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.008" offset="1122721">Now the Smith court made it clear that the between language in the statute, that is between, in this case, any labor organizations referred to contracts and not suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.326" offset="1223972">The statute is very open-ended in its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.195" offset="1235466">It says, suits for violations of contracts between any such labor organizations may be brought in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.800" offset="1269843">What we have here is a claim that there is a violation of one of these types of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.137" offset="1295234">Therefore, a cause of action, a Federal cause of action, exists to remedy that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.625" offset="1321147">Now there are a number of policy reasons which I suggest to the Court lend weight to our position in addition to the language of the statute, which is clear, Plumbers, which is clear, and Smith v. Evening News, which is also clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.227" offset="1443505">What are some of these policy reasons to hold that union members may bring suit under 301 against their union for violation of union constitutions?</text>
            <text syncTime="341.654" offset="1497213">First of all, it's been long determined by this Court that when we are in the area of 301, 301 contracts, that substantive Federal law must apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.795" offset="1549875">That was this Court's determination way back in the Lincoln Mills case, and a long line of precedent following Lincoln Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.253" offset="1587701">And there's good reason for that, particularly in this context, because of the uniformity that applying Federal substantive law brings to the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.310" offset="1635871">Uniformity in the context of the enforcement of a 301 contract, in this case a union constitution, brings to us predictability, it brings to us labor stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.689" offset="1709431">It's far better from a policy perspective to have decisions made on interpretations of union constitutions which may apply to as many as all 50 States, and in this instance, in this case it does, to be determined by a uniform policy of Federal law rather than determined by 50 different State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.541" offset="1824788">If it were determined by 50 different State courts, we could have many different interpretations and we would be creating chaos.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.397" offset="1860210">The whole purpose of the Lincoln Mills concept is to do just the opposite of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.336" offset="1895946">Now in addition, the application of Federal labor law principles should not depend on who happens to file suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.762" offset="1953728">There are different... if that were to occur, and certainly under Plumbers, a local union has the right to sue an international union on a union constitution, an international union has the right to sue a local union on a union constitution under 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.509" offset="2036693">If that were to occur, and individual members were not permitted the right to sue under 301 on this situation, we would end up with different meanings for the same constitutional provision depending upon who happened to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.654" offset="2113284">That would also lead, I'm sure, to forum shopping, which is something that we should try to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.208" offset="2135436">And it would lead to uncertainty and lack of predictability and a destruction of labor stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.830" offset="2169918">Now another policy consideration that I think the Court should look to is the fact that oftentimes in these kinds of cases, LMRDA claims, and that certainly, in this instance it's the same situation... LMRDA claims are intertwined with claims of a breach of a union constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.731" offset="2281617">Frequently, in LMRDA claims, the question of constitutional interpretation, interpreting the union constitution, comes up in many instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.605" offset="2325085">The courts have always assumed that in rendering that interpretation, they must look to Federal law to make a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.430" offset="2372315">Now if we're in a situation where there is no Federal cause of action in this context, are we going to have claims involving intertwined claims of LMRDA violations, union constitution violations, whereby on some of those provisions, in some instances the court makes a determination based on Federal law, yet on the same constitutional provisions, the court makes a determination based upon State law?</text>
            <text syncTime="595.353" offset="2512017">It seems to me that doesn't make a lot of sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="890.859" offset="3694111">First of all, I think Lockridge in fact supports our argument in one respect, and that is that it suggests that matters such as this are matters that are to be committed to the Federal branch of government, not the State branch of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.690" offset="3769448">In that case, of course, it was the NLRB, not the Federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="933.655" offset="3865265">Now that's point number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.355" offset="3872057">Point number two is Lockridge preceded Plumbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.709" offset="3889506">I believe that Plumbers changes the landscape because Plumbers tells us that a union constitution is a 301 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.581" offset="3929004">Now Lockridge never considered the question of 301 at all, never considered whether a union constitution was a 301 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.171" offset="3963276">Now we know that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.289" offset="3967769">And from that point of view, I would have to distinguish Lockridge on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.241" offset="3987622">But I think Lockridge in some respects supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.193" offset="3999430">Another point or policy reason, it seems to me, is that the idea of judicial efficiency... it seems a far better practice for a plaintiff in such a case to litigate the issues all in one forum rather than in two different forums.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.094" offset="4107054">Finally, I think we need to have a remedy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.800" offset="4137879">We have a union constitution which is the basic document defining the rights of union members, vis-a-vis their union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.090" offset="4183018">And it's violated, at least plaintiffs... petitioners claim it's violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.529" offset="4220739">And the circuit court tells us there's no remedy for that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.850" offset="4242055">They tell us on the one hand that there's no State contract claim because 301 preempts it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.206" offset="4275492">They tell us on the other hand that there's no 301 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.408" offset="4292315">There has to be a remedy for this kind of a contractual violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.729" offset="4313526">Otherwise the union constitutions aren't worth the paper they're written on, the protections that they may afford union members are worthless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.536" offset="4364831">And as this case stands here before the Court today, there is no remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.043" offset="5350796">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.212" offset="5355498">The state of the law in union constitutions is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.366" offset="5380158">In 1947, at the time the Taft-Hartley was passed, a union constitution defined two separate types of relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.072" offset="5422894">It defined a relationship between the international union and a member, and it defined a relationship between the international union and its subordinate bodies, the local unions, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.862" offset="5470124">And in both instances, these relationships were considered a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.199" offset="5491439">So 11 years later, in Gonzales, this Court looked at a union constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.789" offset="5521846">At that time a member had been discharged from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.991" offset="5538564">He brought a breach of contract suit in California, and the contract being the union constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.763" offset="5569702">The issue came up, well, was this preempted?</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.399" offset="5588197">Should these issues be Federalized?</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.917" offset="5598333">And the Court at that time said no, that issue should not be Federalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.636" offset="5613170">The next year in 1959, Congress enacted the first comprehensive regulation of the internal affairs of unions in the Landrum-Griffin Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.926" offset="5654339">There, for the first time, was mentioned union constitutions and any kind of regulation of union constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.782" offset="5689761">Approximately 12 years later, in Lockridge, this Court revisited Gonzales, essentially the same issue, the union constitution breach of State... breach of contract in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.094" offset="5759038">And because there was impacted the union security provision in the collective bargaining agreement, the Court in Lockridge held that there should be Garmon preemption, NLRA preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.770" offset="5821732">But both the majority and the dissent in Lockridge recognized that a breach of contract of the union constitution could be brought in State court except in this instance there was a possible conflict, and so the Court preempted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.267" offset="5907727">Then 10 years later, in Plumbers, this Court addressed the relationship between the union and its subordinate bodies in union constitution, and held that that relationship was a 301 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.693" offset="5965405">And that is why we are here today, because of a footnote in Plumbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.330" offset="5984004">Crucial to deciding this case is understanding the nature of a union constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.918" offset="6010336">It's not a collective bargaining agreement, it's not an employment contract, it's not a lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.805" offset="6029875">A union constitution is a charter of an organization, the same way you would have a charter of the YMCA, the YWCA, the Knights of Columbus, or another organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.780" offset="6077732">Parts of it define the relationship between the international union and the local unions, and part of it defines the relationship between the international union and the individual members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.955" offset="6138440">So you have parts of a constitution that deal with a call to the convention in how you run your convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.109" offset="6167071">You have other parts that deal with the merger, consolidation, trusteeship of local unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.965" offset="6198522">You have other parts that deal with the finances of the international union, obviously something important and sacred to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.571" offset="6236974">And it defines the per capita that a local pays the international and how those dues are to be allocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.861" offset="6270097">All these parts of the constitution go to that relationship between the international union and the subordinate bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.366" offset="6304057">There are other parts of union constitutions that define the relationship between the union and its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.805" offset="6337911">There are provisions for qualifications for and admission to membership as well as the admission dues or initiation fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.328" offset="6379916">There are provisions that relate to the pension plan, to how many years a member must have to qualify for death benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.302" offset="6419831">And finally, there are the duties of the local union officers to its members, and that's the part of the constitution that's at issue here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.119" offset="6527142">It deals with both, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.905" offset="6538218">It says what the subordinate unions have to do with respect to the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.190" offset="6551384">So it deals with the members and it also deals with the subordinate unions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.636" offset="6845209">I see that as an obligation in the constitution that governs the officer and the member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.094" offset="6883035">It doesn't say anything about the international.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.744" offset="6889617">Now, if the member... if the officer doesn't do that, that's obviously a violation of the international constitution, but that doesn't express a relationship between that officer and the international union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.821" offset="6957954">We're concerned here with the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.077" offset="6998914">And it's clear that section 301 of Taft-Hartley has been discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.267" offset="7023678">It doesn't talk about internal union affairs, it talks about contracts between any such labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.021" offset="7054711">And as this Court saw in the Plumbers case, there is just no legislative history to assist this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.658" offset="7077281">With that in mind, I think the Court should then look at Landrum-Griffin, which was passed 12 years later, that was the first comprehensive regulation of the internal affairs of the labor unions that dealt with their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.917" offset="7138303">In section 103, in fact in three sections, it specifically said that we do not preempt preexisting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.808" offset="7181875">And let me address a few of those because I think this is crucial with the understanding of what the state of the law was in '47, '59, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.033" offset="7230777">Let's look at what Landrum-Griffin did as far as not preempting preexisting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.036" offset="7258780">In section 103 it said, nothing contained in this title shall limit the rights and remedies of any member of the labor organization under any State or Federal law, or before any court or other tribunal, or under the constitution bylaws of any labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.100" offset="7331087">Section 403 has essentially the same provisions relative to union elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.521" offset="7364733">Then there is another savings clause in section 603 that provides, nothing in this act shall take away any right or bar any remedy to which members of a labor organization are entitled under such other Federal law or law of any State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.184" offset="7439338">This understanding that there was no disturbing the preexisting rights was also had by the commentators at the time, and we have cited Professor Summers' article in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.014" offset="7526692">Professor Summers in that article says that one of the minor disputes in Landrum-Griffin during the congressional debates was between whether there would be a complete preemption of other rights or whether there would be a coexistence of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.542" offset="7596804">And he said there occurred a coexistence of rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2363.359" offset="9584096">First of all, with respect to the question that Justice Scalia asked about provisions relating to governing union elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.369" offset="9644073">It seems to me that is a perfect example of a type of provision that the interest flows in all sorts of different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.373" offset="9672181">I think the international has an interest in local unions' elections being conducted properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.426" offset="9696318">Certainly the local itself has an interest in that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2405.067" offset="9750862">Of course, it always have an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.019" offset="9758698">But I think it is perhaps possible to draw a line between those in which its interest is purely a selfish one, namely I get $5 a head, for example, for all of your local members, how much the international is entitled to as membership fees from the local, and those provisions which are not just for the benefit of the international, but really, it's the international being beneficent to the members of the local.</text>

            <text syncTime="2478.615" offset="10045105">Let me try to clear my mind a second and think of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.567" offset="10056912">I can think of one where there's a provision in a local... in a constitution, that requires before a referendum vote is held, before a referendum vote is held, a mail ballot referendum vote, that the local must conduct a meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.348" offset="10148027">The members must discuss the issue and vote on whether or not that referendum vote should be authorized.</text>

            <text syncTime="2513.288" offset="10183763">It seems to me if the local were then to go ahead and conduct a referendum for whatever reasons contrary to that provision, that local members would certainly have an interest in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.481" offset="10248546">Certainly the local itself would have a clear interest in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.850" offset="10262026">And the international which would want its local to be run according to one, the written constitution, and two, in an appropriate manner, would have a very strong interest in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.490" offset="10304553">I litigated a similar case like that, and that happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.561" offset="10332870">That kind of stuff happens all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.846" offset="10337990">And it seems to me that that kind of situation shows us how unworkable these kinds of categorizations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.619" offset="10377069">Let me just make another point as far as that goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.804" offset="10385846">It seems that the proposition put forth by the respondents in this case is directly in contradiction to Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.629" offset="10437151">Because what Smith tells us is there's you know, there's lots of different provisions in collective bargaining agreements, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.050" offset="10466826">Some of them may flow directly to the union, between the union and the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.621" offset="10489082">Some of them may flow to the individual employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.323" offset="10503919">In Smith, the Court found that the provisions in question flew... I mean flowed, excuse me, to the individual employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.012" offset="10546656">Now they're suggesting that if they flow to the individual employee, there's no Federal cause of action; if they don't flow to the individual employee, then there is a cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.006" offset="10818643">In other words, I can see contracts between unions resolving jurisdictional disputes and so forth would fall right into the whole... same kind of Federal interest involved in collective bargaining agreements.</text>
