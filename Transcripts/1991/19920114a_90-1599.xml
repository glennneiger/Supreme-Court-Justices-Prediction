            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="11.422" offset="188363">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.558" offset="200902">This case comes to the Court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.163" offset="227338">The facts of the case are fairly simple and not that unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.781" offset="245728">I'll review them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.067" offset="254923">The case involves a methamphetamine manufacturing operation that extended over a 4-month period over the summer of 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.356" offset="292121">The operation had essentially two stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.958" offset="302466">The first stage was the portion of the operation in which the respondent and his co-conspirators sought to and ultimately succeeded in building a laboratory to manufacture methamphetamine in Beggs, Oklahoma, a small town south of Tulsa.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.587" offset="369026">They manufactured a large amount of methamphetamine at that lab, using chemicals which they had procured from a chemist in Tulsa.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.125" offset="411135">Unfortunately for them, the chemist in Tulsa was working as an informant for the DEA, and his tipping off the DEA resulted in a raid on the lab and the arrest of several of the co-conspirators and nearly resulted in the arrest of respondent Felix.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.552" offset="472889">That raid occurred July 13, 1987, and it terminated that enterprise for manufacturing methamphetamine at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.593" offset="513013">Now, undeterred by this turn of events, respondent went back to the same chemist, not realizing that he was working with the DEA and attempted to procure some more chemicals to start a new lab, and in fact ordered in late August of 1987 a whole set of the chemicals that would be necessary and asked that they be delivered in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.077" offset="614995">They were, and at the time of the delivery, the chemist having once again tipped off the DEA, Mr. Felix was arrested in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.831" offset="649999">Now, he was prosecuted very quickly in Missouri for the crime of attempt to manufacture methamphetamine.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.770" offset="681764">In the course of that trial, the Missouri trial, the prosecution introduced evidence of the prior operation in Beggs, Oklahoma, in which respondent had in fact manufactured methamphetamine and had set up the lab along with his co-conspirators and introduced that evidence for the purpose of showing that the defendant had the intent to in fact manufacture methamphetamine with these chemicals that he had assembled and ordered and in fact had the capacity to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.891" offset="806211">But what's important for our purposes is it was that evidence of the Beggs, Oklahoma, operation was introduced only for purposes of showing his intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.080" offset="842992">It wasn't introduced as part of a separate prosecution for the Beggs conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.068" offset="862949">In other words, he was being prosecuted in the Missouri case for and only for his activities in late August of 1987, the activities that involved the attempt to manufacture methamphetamine.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="194.458" offset="920523">But intent was an essential element of that offense for which he was being prosecuted--</text>

          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="198.445" stopTime="199.312">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="198.912" offset="938286">That's correct.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="199.312" stopTime="200.595">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="199.312" offset="939854">--And this was shown to prove the intent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="200.595" stopTime="327.978">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="200.595" offset="945078">This was one of the pieces of evidence that was introduced to prove the intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.016" offset="958662">That exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.766" offset="965663">Now, subsequently he was prosecuted... the respondent was prosecuted with several of his co-conspirators in Oklahoma for activities surrounding the Beggs, Oklahoma, operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.991" offset="1014564">First, he was prosecuted... and this was one prosecution which involved a number of counts, but some of the counts, the substantive counts, involved the actual Beggs lab, and those counts ran up to and included July 13th, 1987, but extended no farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.718" offset="1085512">He was also charged with a conspiracy which extended from May 1, 1987, through the Beggs period and into the period of his activities in Missouri through August 31st.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.644" offset="1145176">The district court held that... over his objection that this constituted double jeopardy because he had previously been prosecuted for attempt in Missouri, the district court said no, you're being prosecuted for different crimes, separate offenses, and therefore there's no double jeopardy problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.320" offset="1211945">The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed, holding, in reliance on this Court's decision in Grady against Corbin, that in fact the prior prosecution for attempt, based on the late August activities in Missouri, barred a prosecution for both substantive offenses relating to the Beggs operation and also for the conspiracy throughout the entire summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.257" offset="1323645">The court's rationale was that this was successive prosecution for the same conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.676" offset="1353320">This was a phrase that the court used again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.945" offset="1362410">The court focused on the fact that in the Missouri case the evidence of the Beggs operation had been introduced to prove intent, and in the Oklahoma case evidence of the Missouri transaction had been introduced as part of the proof of the conspiracy, but because the evidence overlapped, the court regarded that as sufficient to constitute successive prosecution for the same conduct.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="327.978" stopTime="346.872">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="327.978" offset="1454570">Under a strict application of Grady would the case have been... would the prosecution have been invalid if in the indictment, in the charging papers for the Missouri attempt, they had alleged the Beggs operation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="346.872" stopTime="377.843">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>

            <text syncTime="347.239" offset="1531579">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.891" offset="1534192">An allegation of simply factual assertions in the indictment that could have been thrown in would have been surplusage, as long as he was not in jeopardy for the Beggs operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.699" offset="1581421">In other words, if they had said in the Missouri indictment, if they had had a charge which related to the Beggs operation, yes, he would have been in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.388" offset="1620187">He could have been separately convicted for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.507" offset="1628650">Or, if they had treated the Beggs operation as part, let's say, of an overall conspiracy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="377.843" offset="1654041">Well, suppose in the attempted prosecution they had treated the Beggs operation as the exclusive evidence of the intent... it's a little bit hard to work with the hypothetical for a point.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="388.766" stopTime="389.468">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="389.468" offset="1700539">Would that have made a difference?</text>
            <text syncTime="390.968" offset="1706495">Because intent is an element of the attempt crime.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_c_bryson" startTime="393.253" stopTime="426.224">
            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="393.253" offset="1715690">It is an element, but even if the Beggs evidence had been the only evidence that had been available to the prosecution to prove the intent in the Missouri case... it's a little hard to imagine that, because the intent could be inferred from the activities themselves, almost certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.882" offset="1786221">But in any event, supposing that that were the only evidence, still what you're talking about is the use of evidence of conduct to prove another offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.487" offset="1824569">You're not talking about an offense that... for which you are being prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.641" offset="1841183">That is the key, we think, to the double jeopardy--</text>

            <text syncTime="428.059" offset="1854871">And the way Grady reads, as I understand it, it takes elements of the crime in a not a very academic or formalistic way, and intent is really more of an element than... I really think than what we are dealing with in Grady.</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.396" offset="4252285">In fact, there is a little bit of evidence... not a lot, but a little bit of evidence that does suggest that the conspiracy was ongoing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.510" offset="4428663">And the reason I think it would change the result is because in Calderone we submit that the defendants were never in jeopardy for the subsequent conspiracy at the time they were prosecuted for the first, and that's the gist of what the district court said in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.568" offset="4484879">It's a little bit of an unusual case because of the way the district court disposed of the first case in not letting the case go to the jury because it didn't involve the same conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.226" offset="4531586">We then reprosecuted for what we had been told was not at issue in the first case and the court of appeals said even so the second prosecution is barred by the first.</text>

            <text syncTime="1116.289" offset="4607759">Now, I think it's important in talking about what exactly it is that Grady has done to compare it with Harris and the Felix case as well, and to see what is really going on in this area, what I think the Court was really trying to do in Grady was to simply extend the concept of lesser-included offenses to cases where your greater offense isn't just... is not just... where it's not just possible that hypothetically the prosecution could prove the greater offense without proving the lesser, but to include as lesser-included offenses cases where the greater offense would necessarily result in the proof of the lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.024" offset="4818724">And let me give concrete examples.</text>

            <text syncTime="1179.796" offset="4861878">Now, of course, the argument could be made that the felony murder... that robbery is not a lesser-included offense of felony murder, because of course the felony murder could have been premised on a rape or an arson, but in that particular case the felony murder was clearly premised on a robbery, and for all practical purposes... not theoretically, but for all practical purposes, then... the felony murder was a greater offense and the robbery was a lesser-included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.030" offset="4970757">That is the rationale, I think, of the Court's judgment in Harris.</text>
