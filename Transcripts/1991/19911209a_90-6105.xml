            <text syncTime="55.208" offset="370035">The two issues presented in the case of Evans v. the United States have to do with first, under the Hobbs Act, title 18, United States Code, section 1951 (b)(2), whether an affirmative act of inducement by a public official such as a demand or threat has to be shown by the Government in an extortion case under color of official right.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.404" offset="466792">The second issue presented is whether, in the absence of that Hobbs Act conviction, should we be successful here, the petitioner was properly convicted for making a false statement on his income tax return when he failed to report a $7,000 payment given by an FBI undercover agent.</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Michael Abbott</label>
            <text syncTime="104.319" offset="566476">The petitioner was convicted on one count of extortion, one count of false statement that was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in September of 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.386" offset="606704">Briefly, in summarizing the facts, in March of 1985 the FBI began an undercover investigation of John Evans that was to continue for approximately 31 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.533" offset="651321">They were investigating allegations that there was public corruption in zoning matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.467" offset="675041">The agent, the FBI agent, posed as a land developer who was new to the Atlanta area.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.001" offset="697192">They first met with Evans in March of 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.043" offset="709418">That meeting essentially was one in which they indicated they would be meeting with governmental bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.205" offset="730002">Evans indicated that he would be glad to assist them if he were able to, and he made no attempt to recontact them after that meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.822" offset="760513">They met again in August of 1985 and the scenario is much the same except that that particular meeting was videotaped.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.115" offset="789666">The focus of the investigation began or it began to heat up in May of 1986, because at that time Evans was running for reelection as a commissioner of DeKalb County, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.545" offset="843374">And if elected, it would be his second term.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.917" offset="852882">There were two contributions made during the course of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.619" offset="871690">In May of 1986, in a meeting with the undercover agent and some associates, Evans was asked if in fact he needed any expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.596" offset="919547">There had been previous talk of campaign... of his reelection campaign, and he took the reference to mean campaign expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.742" offset="948177">He indicated that he needed expenses... or a campaign contribution for a precinct mailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.384" offset="966776">They gave him $300.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.176" offset="973881">He reported the contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.817" offset="980464">He sent a thank-you note.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.579" offset="987465">He made no attempt to recontact the agents, and in fact, he spent approximately $300 that month for his precinct mailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.961" offset="1013065">He was not charged for that particular event.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.944" offset="1024977">The focus of this particular case concerns the events of July 23rd, 24th, and 25th, 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.899" offset="1056742">There was another meeting on July 8th prior to that in which a specific parcel of land was identified by the undercover agent as one they were interested in rezoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.565" offset="1095508">On July 23rd, there were three different calls between Evans and the undercover agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.970" offset="1117032">The middle call was recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.091" offset="1125601">The undercover agent did not record either the first call or the third call.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.094" offset="1145558">There were two factual disputes centering from those two calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.736" offset="1160187">One, who initiated the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.099" offset="1173561">Evans said the agent did and he was returning the agent's call.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.991" offset="1189130">In fact, he introduced into evidence his phone records which showed that the agent had called him at about the time he said, at his undercover apartment, and leaving that number.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.557" offset="1227374">In the third call, Evans said that the agent asked him to bring to a meeting that he was setting up for the following day a list of his campaign needs, because the campaign, the primary campaign, was approximately 2 weeks away.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.694" offset="1271991">The agent said he did not ask Evans to bring any such list, although he concedes that he did set up a meeting for the following day.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.368" offset="1298636">In any case, on July 24th, Evans promised his assistance before anything was offered to him, as he had every time he had met them since March of 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.246" offset="1346179">He had previously indicated that he thought a meaningful contribution would be around $1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.931" offset="1364882">He told them that in May of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.132" offset="1373764">But he had brought with him a budget for this 2 week period before the primary campaign which showed a budget of $14,000, and he had an $8,000 shortfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.337" offset="1410544">The agent indicated that he was willing to give Evans $8,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.950" offset="1429039">Evans testified at that point he was so stunned by the amount of the contribution that what he did was he reported only $1,000 of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.506" offset="1459237">He took $7,000 of it in cash and did not report it until much later, after he was aware of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.708" offset="1484001">He did send a thank-you note to the agent at the time for the contribution and told him when he received it that he was just thankful that the agent would even talk to him about a campaign contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.796" offset="1524334">Evans testified that he used that campaign contribution--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="348.019" offset="1541261">Did he thank him for $1,000 or for $8,000?</text>

            <text syncTime="352.411" offset="1558815">--I don't believe there was any reference to the amount of the contribution, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.313" offset="1570414">He testified... Evans testified that he used that contribution, $7,000 which was not reported, $4,100 went back to his mother who had given him a cash contribution of $5,200 in 1982, 4 years earlier... which was duly recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.854" offset="1640631">And the other $2,900 he paid back to himself because he had made loans to his own campaign, in fact, some 350 loans, all of which were duly documented over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.241" offset="1686188">Evans' contention is he did not condition his assistance on any payment to him whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.568" offset="1719416">The undercover agent admitted as much on cross-examination, that Evans did not condition his assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.232" offset="1742090">The Eleventh Circuit agreed in their opinion that in fact Evans did not condition his assistance, but they said he's not required to.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.845" offset="1768526">The Eleventh Circuit says that in extortion under color of official right, no inducement is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.391" offset="1798724">As the Court is familiar, nine circuits employ what is known as the majority rule, which is basically that if a public official accepts a payment and he knows that that payment is made to him to influence his official action, that is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.460" offset="1862985">Although the nine circuits, or most of them appear to pay some lip service to the word inducement, which is a part of the statute, many of them say that the power of the office itself provides all the coercion necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.740" offset="1916170">And in fact, that's what the Eleventh Circuit says.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.060" offset="1925470">Now at common law, I suppose, that would have been the case, that extortion under color of right would not be said to require inducement.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.472" offset="1995060">In fact, at common law it was a... the offense was a misdemeanor.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.508" offset="2023272">What difference does that make?</text>
            <text syncTime="469.827" offset="2028497">I know you make that point in your brief, and say well, it's more serious here, I don't see what difference that would make.</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Michael Abbott</label>
            <text syncTime="475.981" offset="2053157">--I think it makes a difference because when you back to 1946 when the Hobbs Act was passed, it seems unlikely to me that Congress intended to take a common law misdemeanor in which you could commit the offense by passive acceptance and put it into a statute aimed at professional gangsters where the problem was coercion, violence, and extortion, and make it a 20-year felony without giving an explanation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="500.268" stopTime="508.262">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="500.268" offset="2150228">Well, I guess everyone agrees that it was patterned... that color of right aspect was patterned after the New York law?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="c_michael_abbott" startTime="508.262" stopTime="656.480">
            <label>Mr. C. Michael Abbott</label>
            <text syncTime="508.262" offset="2182201">We certainly contend that, and I believe the Government does also, although at least they did in the McCormick case.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.746" offset="2204144">Now, the New York law is interesting, because first of all it is, of course, a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.259" offset="2222221">It does allow passive acceptance.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.621" offset="2231730">But it's receiving a fee in excess of that allowed by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.805" offset="2248448">What it appears to be, if I understand it correctly, is something like a bill collector who collects fees for the body politic.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.131" offset="2285751">And the offense is committed when he either charges you more than you're supposed to pay, or he charges you when you don't really owe anything, or he charges you before it's actually due.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.206" offset="2318038">Those are how the statutes are normally worded.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.946" offset="2324935">And that's very similar, in fact, to the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.187" offset="2333921">But in this particular case, he was collecting fee in excess of a fee allowed by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.580" offset="2359521">It seems to me in that kind of a case there is actually, probably, coercion, even though you just receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.376" offset="2386688">If a bill collector comes to my door and he wants to collect a fee from me, I know that when he's collecting for the body politic, if I don't pay, there's going to be a penalty for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.172" offset="2421901">I mean, he is a coercive individual simply by the fact of his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.256" offset="2438201">That is not true, I think, of John Evans or anybody who, as an independent agent running a campaign, whether he's just running for office for the first time, or like Evans, in fact he's running for reelection.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.903" offset="2488775">Secondly, as you know, extortion schemes then and now, even to present day, make a distinction between a victim, whose the person who's the payor, and the extortionist, who is the payee.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.952" offset="2548961">We do not prosecute the victim, we prosecute only the person who extorts it.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.605" offset="2563589">Bribery, on the other hand, we prosecute both parties; the person who offers the bribe and the person who receives the bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.609" offset="2587622">There is no better case, I think, that blurs the distinction than the Evans case.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.532" offset="2607370">Because clearly in the Evans case, the FBI agent here, even leaving aside his undercover role, was clearly the aggressor in the scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.359" offset="2638613">By the time that he made the contribution he had courted Evans for some 16 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.279" offset="2654286">By our count, he had offered Evans money some 30 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.963" offset="2669019">He made virtually every call to Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.213" offset="2678006">He virtually set up every meeting to Evans, with exception of one call which was disputed on July 23rd.</text>

            <text syncTime="1629.543" offset="6667321">Just as you said in McCormick, they had no right to present it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.445" offset="6679024">But that was the real problem with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.328" offset="6686548">Our brief was already through the appellate courts and we had not made that argument yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.040" offset="6705356">I understand what Justice Scalia is saying, certainly to the extent that the New York law, which everybody agrees is the law, was a fee statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.704" offset="6732001">And certainly in this particular case the petitioner was not trying to collect money under a fee statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.827" offset="6752481">So to that extent, it would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.870" offset="6760631">Let me just very briefly come to count two, which is only, of course, alive if in fact you should vote for me on count one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.217" offset="6806084">Our argument on count two is very simple and very brief, that count one and count two are inextricably linked, that on count two the jury had to find that it was a campaign contribution and that Evans used it to pay campaign expenses or debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.736" offset="6868151">If they do not find that, then obviously he didn't report it, he was guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.771" offset="6888317">It's our belief if the jury finds extortion on count one, the natural inference is that in fact an extortion of payment is an illegal payment, and therefore not a campaign contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.568" offset="6939517">And in fact, I note in the McCormick argument that there were several questions from this Court along the same lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.713" offset="6968043">One of the justices asked the question, if we assume the judge told the jury a campaign contribution is legal, must we therefore not conclude when they found him guilty of extortion, that it wasn't a campaign contribution?</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.141" offset="7017780">I think that is the natural inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.553" offset="7027393">In this case you have even more, because the judge told the jury that if it comes in the form of a campaign contribution, it still may be extortion, suggesting... in other words, he didn't say if it is a campaign contribution, but if it's accepted in exchange for requested exercise of official power, it is still extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.725" offset="7108059">He said if it comes in the form of the campaign contribution as such, it becomes disguised as a campaign contribution, if it comes labeled as a campaign contribution, or if it comes in the form of a campaign contribution, it's still extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.392" offset="7150796">I think the jury would naturally infer a campaign contribution was illegal if in fact they found extortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.186" offset="7169917">Finally in this case we have the additional element not present in McCormick, that it was a campaign contribution made by an undercover agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.310" offset="7198443">And the question arises, can an undercover agent make a campaign contribution?</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.222" offset="7214117">An issue we raised in the district court as to who has the burden to show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.594" offset="7231566">And to the extent that we believe that the focus of the charge was on the undercover agent, rather than on John Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.651" offset="7263749">The undercover agent's position, as the Government's position, certainly was that it was not a campaign contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.796" offset="7288409">So I think if they found extortion on count one, they were likely to find it was not a campaign contribution, therefore, convict on count two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.779" offset="7316308">I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.051" offset="7705428">But I think the answer to the question is that what the Hobbs Act did was to take a whole range of offenses right out of New York law, including some very serious violent offenses, and say we're putting a, as it was originally passed, a 10-year cap on this and you can sentence from anything from zero up to 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.606" offset="7783586">And the crimes, of course would range in seriousness from very serious violent crimes, perhaps resulting in death, to armed robberies, to very violent extortions, down to something that you might regard as being quite minimal such as taking $10 to which you weren't entitled, if you were a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.127" offset="7849728">And the sentencing court would of course have the freedom to sentence from anything from probation up to 10, and as it was later changed to 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.502" offset="7879194">But we think it's so clear that Congress intended simply to take the entire New York law of extortion, which included not only what we now could call official extortion, but also coercive extortion, two separate crimes, and put it into Federal law defining those two crimes separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.894" offset="7956726">That is so clear that you have to look to New York law and the common law that undergirds New York law to determine what the scope of under color of official right is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2099.702" offset="8548033">Well, all we know is that the cases did not come to the appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.156" offset="8565797">There were some instances, for example of... there was at least one instance of a police disciplinary action which was premised on that statute for taking money on the side in which there was no indication that there was a false pretenses aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.254" offset="8622221">But that was not a prosecution as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.495" offset="8631207">But what's important, I think, about the way the case is, to repeat, is that it adopts in haec verba the common law formulation of official extortion, color of office, and what I think the penal code and later the New York statutes themselves meant by official right is not right to the fee, but authority to perform official services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.723" offset="8728069">In other words, color of official right is not my claim of right to be paid, but my claim of right to take these kinds of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.056" offset="8761401">And the example I would give, Your Honor, is the policeman, who as in a case which is very parallel to the New York statute coming from Pennsylvania in which the policeman said, give me $50, and I'll let you open this house of prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.609" offset="8827648">Now, there's no question that there was no assertion of entitlement to the $50 by virtue of there being a $50 fee associated with opening houses of prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.744" offset="8868190">Everyone that was a party to that transaction understood that the $50 was not legitimate, not a legitimate fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.388" offset="8890760">But nonetheless, it was by virtue of his authority, his claim of right, his use of his office, or misuse of his office... that was the basis for his obtaining the $50, and that is consistent with everything in the common law, all the way back to the first statute of Westminster in 1275, when... where there was no crime of bribery at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.053" offset="8985428">The crime that was created was the crime of official extortion, and it covered a whole range of official misconduct, including classic bribery conduct, including conduct involving false representation, and including coercive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.353" offset="9042584">And some examples, and I think the best source for these examples is the Law Review article which we cite several times by Lindgren.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.827" offset="9068497">But he goes through a number of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.987" offset="9077170">The examples from the common law, one after another after another, are cases in which, for example, a jailer says to somebody who's being held, and says, I will let you out if you give me some money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.087" offset="9129519">Everybody... there's no indications that there's... it's a representation by the jailer that he's entitled to that fee, it's an obviously corrupt transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.621" offset="9159717">That's extortion under color of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.525" offset="9171315">Now our contention is that's exactly the crime that the New York law codified in 1881 when it passed what amounts to the penal code.</text>

            <text syncTime="2272.154" offset="9237770">And I think you can find the source for that in the New York law itself because if you take the New York statute that was enacted after the penal code, this was the statute of 1881, and the provisions of this statute have continued right on through the period in which the Hobbs Act was enacted, and right up until there was a large revamping of New York criminal law in 1965.</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.462" offset="9707034">And that at least would be our analogy with the official who initiates the transaction by saying, I will do thus and so if you give me the money.</text>

            <text syncTime="2423.074" offset="9841512">But I think the analogy further breaks down because there are coercive extortion cases in which the defendant is not the person who puts someone at fear, the defendant, let's say a mob boss, is not the person who either initiates the fear or takes any sort of steps to put the person in fear.</text>
