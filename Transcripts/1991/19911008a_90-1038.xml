            <label>Mr. Marc Z. Edell</label>
            <text syncTime="9.720" offset="184016">Thank you Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.434" offset="210870">The issue in this case is whether the Federal Cigarette Labeling Act preempts State common law tort claims against cigarette manufacturers for failure to warn, fraud, deception, and misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.361" offset="262488">In 1964, the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health issued its landmark report.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.607" offset="291536">In that report, it indicted cigarette smoking as the major cause of preventable death in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.052" offset="317345">In response to that report, States and municipalities across the country began proposing legislation that would require cigarette manufacturers to place warning labels on their packs of cigarettes and in their advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.341" offset="374501">At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission began its rulemaking process which would likewise require cigarette manufacturers to place a specific warning on packs of cigarettes and in their advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.129" offset="425597">In the wake of all this activity, in 1965, Congress intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.942" offset="444823">Congress intervened for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.876" offset="468646">First, to decide what steps it should take on a national basis in light of the Surgeon General's report and its conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.431" offset="502815">And second, to address the cigarette manufacturers' concern that if they were forced by these various State regulations and the Federal Trade Commission to put different warning labels on packages of cigarettes and in their advertising, they would not be able to conduct business on a national basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.261" offset="570106">Congress heard hearings for many weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.915" offset="588705">Industry representatives testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.218" offset="601975">Submissions were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.220" offset="613992">The industry again asked for preemption of State regulations and of the FTC so that they could go ahead and do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.644" offset="643667">Congress, in enacting the 1965 Cigarette Labeling Act required, one, a specific warning on packs of cigarettes; and two, it gave the industry the preemption it asked for, not preemption of State common law tort claims... claims that the industry had already been faced with for over a decade prior to the 1965 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.419" offset="738753">It preempted any statements to be required on packages of cigarettes other than the Federally mandated statement, and it preempted any warning requirements in cigarette advertising whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.150" offset="805730">In 1969, Congress intervened again on the issue of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.085" offset="833420">It was not because the cigarette manufacturers, now 15 years into the litigation, decided that they needed some protection from these tort suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.090" offset="865499">The reason was that the section 1334(b), that is the preemption section applicable to warning labels in advertising, was to expire on July 1, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.240" offset="922028">Congress again held hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.483" offset="934984">And again the industry said, we need preemption of State regulations that would require us to put different warning labels on packs of cigarettes and in our advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.360" offset="978557">And again, Congress gave them their request.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.644" offset="995693">But Congress decided in 1969 to restructure the act somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.446" offset="1014919">It restructured it by giving the Federal Trade Commission freedom now to proceed with its rulemaking process to decide whether or not warnings should be required in cigarette advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.376" offset="1070612">It restructured it also to make clear that not only were the States, but also the States' political subdivisions were also precluded from imposing these regulations that would require warning labels in advertising or in... on packages of cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.740" offset="1152010">In 1969, Congress also decided on a new warning, and for other reasons it removed cigarette advertising from electronic media.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.520" offset="1211151">At no time during the 1969 hearings or in the 1965 hearings did the industry ask for protection for these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.096" offset="1249499">At no time during either of the hearings in 1965 or '69 is there any suggestion that Congress, any one Congressman... Congressperson... suggested that there would be preemption of State common law tort claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.647" offset="1323686">All discussions regarding State common law tort claims were based upon the assumption that these cases were to continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.837" offset="1552415">And in fact, the Third Circuit did not read 1334(b) as specifically including these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="666.473" offset="2810994">Justices O'Connor, I think that is probably one of the more difficult issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.897" offset="2832728">Not necessarily only on fraudulent misrepresentation, because the question that's posed to the jury on that issue is, did cigarette manufacturer X fraudulently misrepresent to its consumers the health hazards of cigarette smoking.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.298" offset="2898243">And when the jury considers that issue, they will consider not only the advertising, they will consider the public relations communications.</text>

            <text syncTime="713.585" offset="2999389">Because we don't know from the jury verdict whether or not it was the... a particular advertisement that convinced the jury that there was fraudulent misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.063" offset="3041394">I think the harder issue, and I will admit it, is the express warranty issue, where you have a particular advertisement, and a jury says this particular advertisement is a breach of warranty.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="1480.066" offset="6065329">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.253" offset="6106080">I would like at the outset to briefly summarize why we think that the act preempts the claims at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.599" offset="6135442">First, it was the judgment of Congress reflected in the act that the Federal Government should make the ultimate decisions about what cigarette companies must or must not say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.116" offset="6185597">That is that it, along with the Federal agencies, should set the standards of conduct that the companies were required to meet in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.573" offset="6223422">To carry out this scheme, the States were preempted from setting their own standards of conduct, and it naturally follows that unless Congress says otherwise in the act, that Congress also means to preempt the States from enforcing their standards of conduct, whether they choose to do so by sanctions, like fines, or remedial provisions, like damages and injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.269" offset="6322165">Second, Congress did not mean to preempt just some State restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.234" offset="6345988">Although Congress clearly was concerned and wanted to preempt the ability of the States to require warnings in advertisements, it wanted to preempt any restrictions, like bans on advertising or partial bans on advertising that would upset the balance of interest, national interest, that Congress itself had struck in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.925" offset="6432819">And that scope of preemption covers all the claims before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.101" offset="6453508">Now in discussing the question of preemption, I think it is useful to keep in mind the background against which Congress was legislating in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.499" offset="6499066">As petitioner has noted, after the Surgeon General's report came out, there were a number of different proposals regarding restrictions that could be put on the marketing of cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.074" offset="6541384">There were a number of different warnings that had been drafted and proposed, and there were proposals to require warnings on packages, to require warnings in advertisements, to ban advertising altogether as far as cigarettes were concerned, or less restrictive bans on advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.045" offset="6605228">And what Congress recognized, correctly, was that this was a national problem and it needed a national solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.603" offset="6643471">And thus, that it was the Federal Government, Congress together with the agencies, that would have to ultimately set the requirements that the companies would have to meet.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.632" offset="7103644">And what happened in fact, and the legislative history supports this... in 1969, what was before Congress was essentially a debate about the scope of the 1965 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.529" offset="7151187">A number of Congressmen took the position that the 1965 act essentially covered only what your question would suggest, Justice Stevens, simply requirements about statements in advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="1773.165" offset="7237704">What it did was preempted all State regulation of advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="2087.664" offset="8495762">The exception is where Congress makes clear in the act that despite its preemption of the standards, it is willing to tolerate some particular form of enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2190.594" offset="8907451">I think what Congress was dealing with, frankly throughout, from 1965 on, was the variety of different means of regulation, a variety of different efforts at both the State and the Federal level to impose restrictions on cigarette companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.968" offset="8984983">And I think what Congress did was to say quite explicitly, certainly in 1969 explicitly, that we do not want the States to be imposing requirements or prohibitions in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.160" offset="9049766">That, supported by the legislative history, I think, makes clear that Congress does not want a State, for example, to require that a warning be put in an advertisement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.851" offset="9152480">If a State can say all right, maybe we're preempted from requiring a warning, what we will do is we'll ban advertising altogether, or we'll ban advertising that doesn't carry a warning, or we will say that any advertising even if it does carry a warning, but shows attractive subjects, pleasant settings, is misleading because it suggests that smoking and health are compatible and we as a State have made the judgment that they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.672" offset="9271807">In all of those situations, it seems to me, Congress is saying this is not something we want the States to be free to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.190" offset="10501861">But, if in fact... excuse me, we're not willing to tolerate that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2604.193" offset="10561838">The effect of both of them is exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.797" offset="10572287">Let me take an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.118" offset="10581587">If a State has a statute that says we do not permit deceptive or misleading advertising in this State, and we have an agency that is set up to administer this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.974" offset="10617009">And it will review your advertising to determine whether it is permitted or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.218" offset="10633936">And that agency then determines that any advertising by a cigarette company is inherently misleading unless it just has the name of the cigarette.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.465" offset="10682942">There is no reason to think that so long as the agency is acting that way and not... or by a specific adjudication, that it would make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.852" offset="10724529">And yet one would be more general, one would be more specific, and the overall statute could be quite general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.467" offset="10746994">But the effect, ultimately, is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.599" offset="10755458">What the State is saying is, in our State, you have to meet these standards of conduct, and that is essentially the price that you have to pay to market in our State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2909.318" offset="11782384">But there's more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.498" offset="11783115">Let me set out, if I can... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.650" offset="11787713">Let me set out if I can what I think is the landscape as far as remedies are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.851" offset="11808506">What Congress has clearly prohibited are remedies based on State requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.676" offset="11839748">That is what Congress, we say, has shut down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.940" offset="11856885">State requirements within the field of labeling, advertising, and promotion, what the companies can and cannot say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.715" offset="11876006">However, that doesn't exhaust the field, to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.206" offset="11893874">There are other types of suits that can be brought connected with smoking which are outside the field entirely, as I've indicated before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.582" offset="11923445">So when the plaintiffs are saying there is not a remedy here, when they are saying, for example, there is not a remedy for failure to warn, what they're really saying is there is not a failure for not... there is not a remedy for not giving a greater warning than the warning that Congress required and said was the only warning that you could be required to give.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.573" offset="11995438">In the misrepresentation field, for example, to the extent that the claims are based, as they typically are, on standard product advertising, that again is specifically an area in which the Congress did not want the States to be able to set requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.234" offset="12061998">So the fact that one would say you have engaged, in our view, in misleading advertising within our State because you have shown, as I say, attractive people in an ad, or an attractive setting, the fact that you cannot bring a claim for that and get a remedy any more than an agency could fine you for doing the same thing is because Congress did not intend the States to be able to do that.</text>
