            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90844">The second case I have to announce is No. 90-6113, White against Illinois and here, petitioner Randall White was convicted in an Illinois State Court of sexually assaulting S.G., the initials given to a four-year-old girl to protect her anonymity.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.281" offset="175899">In the minutes immediately following the assault, S. G. told her babysitter, her mother, and a police officer that petitioner had assaulted her.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.216" offset="219680">Several hours later, while at the hospital, she repeated her account to a nurse and to a doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.064" offset="247056">S.G. never testified at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.084" offset="259177">However, over petitioner's objection, the prosecutor called to testify each of the five people who had heard S.G.'s story and that each repeat the statements that S.G. made about the assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.581" offset="313094">These statements were admitted by the trial judge under two state law exceptions to the general rule excluding hearsay evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.257" offset="347784">One that permits witnesses to repeat statements made by another person while that person was excited and another, permitting witnesses to testify about statements by another while that person was in the course of securing medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.616" offset="405254">Petitioner appealed his conviction claiming that the Trial Court violated his right to confront the witnesses against him as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution by allowing this testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.731" offset="457708">The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed and we granted certiorari to resolve this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.581" offset="481113">We hold that petitioner's confrontation right was not violated and affirm the decision of the Illinois Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.018" offset="506818">We reject the argument advanced by the United States as amicus curiae that no violation occurred here because the Confrontation Clause is generally not intended to apply to hearsay testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.345" offset="552166">We think such an argument comes too late in the day given the court's long history of recognizing that hearsay testimony may often implicate Confrontation Clause concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.808" offset="598037">Nonetheless, while hearsay statements do raise these concerns, we conclude they are admissible based on a firmly ridded exception to the prohibition against receipt of hearsay testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.824" offset="646103">Such exceptions like the two involved here provide alternate guarantees of trustworthiness such that the requirement for in-court testimony of the decelerant may be dispensed with even if she is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.184" offset="699497">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justice Scalia joins.</text>
