            <text syncTime="60.832" offset="391513">The October 12, 1990, order of the Illinois Supreme Court completely disregarded this Court's precedent in Illinois State Board of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party and Moore v. Ogilvie.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.841" offset="451595">More importantly, not only did it disregard the precedent previously set by this Court, but it was a flagrant and blatant attempt to limit political opposition to the existing Democratic Party machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.970" offset="500078">I hasten to point out to this Court that the Harold Washington Party is now the second largest political party in the city of Chicago and of the municipality of Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.318" offset="661515">The striking of the entire Harold Washington Party from the ballot was a judicially contrived remedy by the four Democratic Party justices of the Illinois Supreme Court, and indeed, contradicted the rule of law as previously set forth by that court in Anderson v.

            <text syncTime="190.470" offset="910096">There is but one Harold Washington Party, and references to the contrary by opposing counsel are simply misrepresentations of the fact.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth L. Gillis</label>
            <text syncTime="987.569" offset="4098498">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="990.901" offset="4111768">If I might follow up on the last question.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.673" offset="4126919">There are two districts in Cook County, the large City of Chicago and the large suburban area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.919" offset="4159833">Each has over a million registered voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.322" offset="4169446">The... after this Court's ruling in 1979 in the Socialist Workers case, Illinois put a cap of 25,000 signatures on any large district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.589" offset="4214586">So that's what you need in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.300" offset="4221378">In this case, the Harold Washington Party did obtain 25,000... in fact, 44,000... signatures in the city of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.125" offset="4256695">And these petitions had two components, the county-wide candidates at the top, and the city of Chicago candidates also on the same petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.811" offset="4299432">So my client, the electoral board ruled that they had qualified to run county-wide at-large candidates as well as candidates in the city of Chicago for county commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.919" offset="4343840">On the other hand, and this is the one point we differ with the Harold Washington Party, the Harold Washington Party only filed 7,800 signatures in the suburban area, or about one-half of 1 percent of the million and some registered voters there are in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.551" offset="4414370">The Cook County Electoral Board held that that did not show a modicum of support, and hence did not let them on the ballot in the suburban area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.707" offset="4447076">What the Illinois Supreme Court seems to have done, although they did not use these words, is to apply what's known in Illinois law as the complete slate requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.704" offset="4491066">It amounts to a rule that if any one of your candidates is off, they all go off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.528" offset="4514367">The Illinois Supreme Court's order stated that since there were not sufficient signatures in the suburbs, all the candidates went off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.635" offset="4554700">This Court's order of last October 25th stayed that order and upheld the order of my client, the electoral board, which says if you qualify in the city, and you can show a modicum of support there, those candidates go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.245" offset="4613214">And also the at-large candidates went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.779" offset="4623350">It seems to me that the Illinois Supreme Court's order, and the feeling behind that, could be shown in a dissenting opinion in a 1977 Illinois case called Anderson v. Schneider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.377" offset="4677685">That shows the workings of the complete slate rule, or the... at least the thoughts of some of the justices about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.432" offset="4709972">I submit that is a harsh rule and one that intends to block ballot access.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.609" offset="7018674">The Illinois Supreme Court said nothing about complete slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.911" offset="7039885">The issue concerning the complete slate is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.176" offset="7056917">That seven people who were on this ticket did not get enough nomination signatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.301" offset="7077397">As a result of that, the nomination petition that was submitted for the formation of the new political party, that is the county-wide Harold Washington Party, was not in proper form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.649" offset="7118775">The fact that the Illinois Supreme Court struck it down was for that very reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.693" offset="7143017">There were three things before the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.726" offset="7151063">The first issue was the Harold Washington Party use... the use of the Harold Washington Party name by this new political party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.472" offset="7182096">The second was the 25 signature requirement for each of the units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.923" offset="7199859">And the third was the propriety of the form... of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.297" offset="7213443">And on behalf of my clients, who were objectors to these petitions, the Illinois Supreme Court was correct in all three instances.</text>
