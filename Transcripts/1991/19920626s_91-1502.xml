            <text syncTime="5.179" offset="111868">The first is Franklin versus Massachusetts which comes to us on appeal from a three-judge District Court in the District of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.562" offset="157426">The District Court's judgment directed federal officials to reform the 1990 census and to reapportion congressional representatives accordingly giving one more representative to Massachusetts and one less to Washington State.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.265" offset="224195">The federal officials who determined the census and reapportionment appealed from that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.097" offset="247496">In the opinion filed today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.602" offset="261497">The Constitution requires that the apportionment or representatives be redetermined every 10 years by an actual enumeration of persons in each state.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.348" offset="304547">After the Secretary of Commerce takes the census, she reports the tabulation to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.952" offset="326908">He, intern, sends Congress a statement showing the number of persons in each state and he determines according to a calculation prescribed by statute the number of representatives to which each state will be entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.048" offset="379362">In 1990, for only the second time since 1900, the Census Bureau allocated the Department of Defense's overseas employees to particular states for reapportionment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.051" offset="435368">The allocation of these employees changed the relative state population counts enough to give Washington one more representative and Massachusetts one less.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.529" offset="481239">At least, Massachusetts and two of its registered voters filed an action against Census Bureau officials, the Secretary of Commerce, and the President among others, challenging the counting of overseas employees as contrary to the Constitution and is arbitrary and capricious in violation of standard set by the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.104" offset="571519">The District Court did not reach the constitutional claims but found the Census Bureau's decision to allocate overseas employees was arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.312" offset="612374">We hold, first, that the District Court erred in reviewing the Administrative Procedure Act claims because there is no final agency action at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.155" offset="651767">the final action that determines the reapportionment is the President's statement to Congress, not the Secretary's census count.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.786" offset="682278">Up until the time that the President informs Congress of the new apportionment, the census figures are subject to change and, if not, settle the reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.124" offset="735672">And the President's action, while final, is not subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act because the President is not expressly included within the Act's definition of agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.125" offset="783633">Respect for the separation of powers and the President's unique constitutional role makes textural silence insufficient to subject the President's statutory duties to Administrative Procedure Act review.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.671" offset="837863">Second, we hold that Massachusetts' constitutional claim falls on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.997" offset="859075">The decision to allocate overseas federal employees to their home states is consistent with the constitutional language and the goal of equal representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.683" offset="897840">It is also compatible with the standard of usual residence which was the phrase used in the first enumeration Act and which has been used by the Bureau ever since to allocate persons to their home states.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.924" offset="946846">The phrase has carried broad connotations of enduring ties to a place and allows for temporary absences from a state especially those compelled by government service.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.966" offset="990941">Those serving the United States abroad may constitutionally be included in the enumeration of their home states and may be represented in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.745" offset="1030124">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justices Blackmun, Kennedy, and Souter have joined; Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
