            <text syncTime="16.753" offset="213846">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.823" offset="222101">The issue in this case is what test should be applied to determine whether an expenditure is capital in nature and therefore not currently deductible as an ordinary business expense under section 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.115" offset="287302">This is a fundamental issue arising, as the Commissioner says, in virtually every area of business activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.488" offset="316768">We contend that the separate and distinct asset test enunciated by this Court in the Lincoln Savings case is controlling, and should have been applied to determine that petitioner's payments are currently deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.708" offset="373611">The Commissioner, on the other hand, would not have any general test and would instead make a case-by-case determination of the test to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.964" offset="414675">In this case, he would employ a nonrecurring future benefit test to find that petitioner's payments were capital expenditures, not deductible either currently or at any time before petitioner's final liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.494" offset="472772">The issue arises in the context of an unsolicited offer by Unilever, a large, multinational group of companies, to buy petitioner's stock, which was publicly held.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.573" offset="521150">On advice of counsel, petitioner engaged an investment banking firm to value the company so that its board of directors could make recommendations to the stockholders concerning the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.388" offset="564409">Under Delaware law, it was required to advise the stockholders, and it had to do this whether or not the stockholders ultimately approved the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.216" offset="603697">The board's recommendation turned out to be favorable, the stockholders voted to approve the offer, and they closed in August 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.032" offset="638910">Petitioner itself did not buy or sell any stock or other assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.874" offset="658346">Only stockholders transferred their stock to Unilever Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.138" offset="675377">This transfer was accomplished in part by a merger of a transitory subsidiary into petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.583" offset="709128">Before the transaction, the Commissioner ruled that this merger should be disregarded and the transaction should be treated as a direct purchase and sale between the stockholders and the Unilever Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.154" offset="771404">After the stock purchase, petitioner carried on its business essentially in the same way as before, without any significant technological or other assistance from Unilever.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.371" offset="816334">The investment banking and legal fees and other expenses incurred by petitioner were reasonable in amount and customarily incurred in transactions of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.121" offset="931273">The tax court and the court of appeals held that these payments were nondeductible capital expenditures because they were incident to a transaction that, in their view, conferred a long-term benefit on petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="616.494" offset="2612827">At any rate, to get back to the last statement of the facts, the benefit that the courts below, the reason why they capitalized the expenditures in question, was because of the possibility that petitioner's new parent might at some point in the future provide technological or other assistance to petitioner in its business operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.339" offset="2696210">We believe that the separate and distinct asset test, rather than the future benefit test as followed by the courts below, is controlling for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.455" offset="2732677">First, the separate and distinct asset test is the only test for capitalization that is consistent with the tax accounting system set up by Congress in the code, and second, the future benefit approach has three critical flaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.945" offset="2794639">First, it is not... it is inconsistent with our tax accounting system; secondly, it fails to provide any principle or basis for distinguishing between admittedly deductible expenses and expenditures that have to be capitalized; and thirdly, it will generate unending controversy because of its inherently subjective and speculative nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.388" offset="2868409">Before addressing these points, I would like to mention that the Commissioner would not necessarily apply a future benefit test in every case, and indeed he does not support the formulation of the future benefit test that the court below indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.187" offset="2927550">However, we believe that his position is even more at odds with the statute and would further undermine predictable and evenhanded administration of the tax law.</text>

            <text syncTime="707.954" offset="2978646">In Lincoln Savings, this Court held that the presence of an ensuing benefit having some future aspect was not controlling as to the capital nature of an expenditure.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.080" offset="3255126">Certainly the Court did not reject in that case separate and distinct asset as a general test, and we think that it should adopt that test as a general test for the reason I'm about to state, and the reason is that, as I said, that this is the only test that's consistent with the tax accounting system in the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.882" offset="3334329">As the cases in this Court... this Court and other courts, and as the Commissioner agrees, the goal of the system is not simply to disallow a current deduction and thereby tax gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.580" offset="3381141">Rather, the intention is to spread out the effect of a capital expenditure over its revenue-producing life.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.634" offset="3405382">The system does this by providing for the recovery of these capitalized costs through depreciation or amortization, or by deduction from the proceeds realized upon a sale, or upon another disposition, such as by abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.374" offset="3468285">In each and every case, the code sections that perform this function require that there be a property or an asset with a basis, or else they just don't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.851" offset="3510186">For example, section 167 allows depreciation for, quote, property used in the trade of business, and determines the amount of depreciation by reference to the basis of the property, which is its cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.720" offset="3561699">The regulations under section 167 allow amortization of an intangible asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.212" offset="3583642">Section 1001 computes gain or loss by reference... on a sale by reference to the adjusted basis of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.827" offset="3614153">Since costs are capitalized under the Lincoln Savings test only where there's an asset or an item of property, then the taxpayer has the means of recovering his cost through those statutory provisions, and therefore the test is entirely consistent with the statutory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.431" offset="4252586">Capital structure is just one case where there is no definite life, and as I said before also, if there were a definite life, it is amortizable, so you do have a means of recovery in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1099.530" offset="4544948">Future benefit is not the appropriate test, it's the separate and distinct asset test that is the appropriate test, and there was a finding by the courts below, and a statement to that effect by the court of appeals in particular, that there was no asset found, there was no asset in this case, and I don't see how there could be an asset in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.763" offset="4929888">That word apparently has two meanings, according to the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.676" offset="4945562">One is that it's usual and customary, and the other is that it's not a capital expenditure, and yes, if it is not a capital expenditure, and if it meets the other requirements of section 162(a), then it should be allowed as a deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.454" offset="4992582">If it is not allowed as a deduction, it will never be recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.096" offset="5003240">As I said before, the Government... and let me just address that point for a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.719" offset="5017660">The Government in its brief says that we would get this deduction on... we would get a deduction on final liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.024" offset="5042946">That assertion rests on the cases that deal with capital structure, where they held that it was an intangible asset and the asset was lost on liquidation, but the section under which that was allowed as a deduction was the predecessor of section 165, and section 165 now, and did then, requires that in order to have a deductible loss, it's limited to the basis of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.159" offset="5139495">So if you don't have property, if you don't have an asset, there is no deduction under those cases, and therefore there's no deduction under the Commissioner's position here, ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.995" offset="5174812">If we don't have a change in capital structure, then there... there is... no asset, even arguably is no asset to which this cost can be assigned, and we never get a deduction, and that would be true even if it were known at the outset that the life of this benefit... let's assume that there was a future benefit, an even more concrete one than was found by the courts below, but it would only last for 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.058" offset="5263002">Let's assume that Unilever had to dispose of the stock of the company in 10 years, for whatever reason, so we knew it would only last for 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.063" offset="5291110">You would think that under a rational net income tax system you'd be able to write off that cost over that 10-year period when you were realizing the benefit, or at least that you'd get a loss at the end of that period, a deductible loss under 165.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.942" offset="5338548">The answer is, you would not get a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.273" offset="5347952">There is no provision in the code that would give you either the write-off over the 10-year period, or the loss, because there is no asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.428" offset="5376478">Each of those provisions depends on there being property or an asset with basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.447" offset="6044586">This is a case where starting at the beginning really will help us get to the end, so before I discuss Lincoln Savings and the reorganization expense cases I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about the fundamental analytical issue that's present in every capital expense case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.327" offset="6108115">The distinction between capital and ordinary expenses is rooted in the simple fact that the Federal income tax is assessed and collected on an annual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.644" offset="6145418">In order to reflect taxable income for each separate year, it's necessary to match the income derived from each year's activities with the expenses incurred to produce that year's income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.241" offset="6195782">The problem that is addressed in capital expense cases arises when an expense incurred in one year assists in producing income in more than a single year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.488" offset="6236742">For example, 2 years of prepaid rent, if it's deducted entirely in the current year it would understate present income and overstate income in the following year, so the function of capitalization is to achieve, as Judge Wisdom said in the Ellis Banking case, an accurate measure of net income by properly matching expenses with the income that it benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.803" offset="6330052">While capitalization is conceptually necessary for all expenses that create a material future benefit, the goal of achieving an accurate measure of net income is a pragmatic one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.603" offset="6381252">Expenses of advertising and maintenance create both present and future benefits, but capitalization is not required as a practical matter even though some future benefit results, because the current benefit predominates and the expense is a regularly recurring one, so you achieve essentially the same statement of income whether you deduct the entire expense in the current year or whether you amortize a portion that relates to the future benefit each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.752" offset="6497862">Since the current deduction for those kinds of recurring expenses would not materially misstate income, they are allowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.454" offset="11456635">Our position was that if it benefits the corporation, then it's capital.</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.408" offset="11536465">The findings of the tax court were that this created several long-term benefits for the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.120" offset="11555273">We think that's sufficient in this case to remove the issue of constructive dividend treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.404" offset="11580455">We also agree with petitioner it would be very hard to sell to the shareholders that they... they received any benefit from this $$ 2, 250, 000 fee, because all that Morgan Stanley recommended was a purchase... was that the sale go forward at $ 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.712" offset="11637715">It was management that insisted upon and obtained a higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.035" offset="11650986">I wanted to return, if I could, to the third benefit that Indopco received from its reorganization, because it is in its own sense extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.386" offset="11720367">By retiring the shares of the major stockholder, Indopco removed what they called the overhang on the market, of the existence of that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.566" offset="11773030">The only way this overhang could be removed was through a reorganization that changed the common stock of the Greenwalls to fixed value preferred stock, and the fixed value preferred stock was secured by a $ 100, 000, 000 capital infusion from Unilever to Holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.721" offset="11865712">That's described at page 76 in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.384" offset="11880341">It is described in somewhat murky detail in the exchange agreement, which is at page 500 of the court of appeals' record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.961" offset="11910643">That substantial capital infusion solved a long-term problem for the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.694" offset="11941572">There was an additional $ 2, 000, 000 capital infusion from Unilever to Holding to Starch, or Indopco, which was used for the purpose of retiring the employee's rights in the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.032" offset="11990995">They didn't hold stock, they held rights to stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.925" offset="12002489">That 2, 000, 000 retired those rights, which is clearly a long-term benefit for the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.087" offset="12023178">Now, that's described at page 564 in the court of appeals' record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.771" offset="12045852">These long-term benefits for the corporation bring this case squarely within the rule described by Bittker and Eustice that the reorganizational expenses of an acquired corporation are not deductible currently but should be capitalized.</text>

            <text syncTime="3001.839" offset="12154208">I'd like to return to a point that Mr. Jones... an answer to Justice Scalia's question concerning hostile takeovers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.909" offset="12214499">You asked him, Justice Scalia, what would happen, what kind of deduction would be allowed if there were a hostile takeover that turned out to be unsuccessful, and counsel answered that there would be a, sort of a suspension of the costs, and then when it turned out... it proved out that the transaction was unsuccessful, the takeover was unsuccessful, the company had successfully resisted it, that there would be a loss, a deductible loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.860" offset="12342290">Now, the only provision in the code that allows a deductible loss is section 165, and the amount of the deduction that is allowed by that section is limited to the basis of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.099" offset="12399237">It says, for the purposes of subsection (a), which is the subsection that allows the loss, the basis for determining the amount of the deduction for any loss shall be the adjusted basis for determining the loss from the sale or other disposition of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.629" offset="12461304">So there's no loss unless you have property with a basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.582" offset="12477186">Now, where is the property in the case of the hostile takeover?</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.954" offset="12494636">There is no property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.927" offset="12502473">The company itself has no property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.067" offset="12631100">Yes, we do, Your Honor, and that's... and that's what we claim with respect to these expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.972" offset="12654715">These expenses did not produce any property, and I disagree with counsel's answer to the question about current benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.885" offset="12682404">There was no... these expenses did not produce revenue, but they did help the board discharge its fiduciary obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.579" offset="12709154">Now, a lot of expenses a corporation incurs that don't produce any benefit, particularly a publicly-held company... you have to send reports to the SEC, you have to send reports to stockholders, you have to comply with safety regulations, you have environmental laws, things that would actually hinder your revenue-producing capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.011" offset="12774878">Nevertheless, there's no question that these are deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.012" offset="12786894">These are things that a company has to do in order to carry on business as a company, and just because they don't produce a current income doesn't mean they're not deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under 162(a), and I think you have to look at the origin of these costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.973" offset="12850737">Counsel mentioned the Woodward case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.394" offset="12860350">The Woodward case held that the costs were capitalizable because they adhered in the process of acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.708" offset="12885637">The taxpayer before the court in that case was the... was the company that was making the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.592" offset="12909147">This company here is the target.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.634" offset="12921372">It is not making any acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.376" offset="12928269">The origin of its expenses was the fiduciary duty that the board had to the stockholders, not any process of acquisition by the company itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.032" offset="12962959">The other point that... that I think reveals a flaw in the Government's position about future benefit, it just doesn't account for a whole host of expenses that everyone would agree are deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.111" offset="13019279">Advertising the courts recognize, and there can be no doubt that advertising has a future benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.444" offset="13040595">Strategic planning, companies have whole departments devoted to strategic planning for the future... nothing but the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.099" offset="13083227">Companies could not carry on business without doing things that... that affect their future revenue, and for long periods of time in the future, and yet they... they are deductible.</text>
