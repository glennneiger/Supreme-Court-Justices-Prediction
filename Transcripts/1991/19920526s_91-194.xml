            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="90897">The second case I have to announce is No. 91-194, Quill Corporation against North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.365" offset="124334">The case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.738" offset="145754">Petitioner, Quill, is a mail-order house that maintains neither outlets nor sales representatives in North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.274" offset="171981">This case involves North Dakota's efforts to require Quill to collect and pay a use tax on goods purchased for use within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.422" offset="212523">The North Dakota Supreme Court upheld the state's collection effort ruling that social, economic, and legal innovations had rendered obsolete our 1967 ruling in National Bellas Hess versus the Department of Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.019" offset="266962">In that case, our Court held that a similar tax imposed by the State of Illinois violated both the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and also created an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.989" offset="322760">Our ruling today has two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.905" offset="330492">First, we observe that our due process jurisprudence has evolved substantially over the last 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.130" offset="359331">We conclude that under the governing principles of that body of law, a mail-order house like Quill has the necessary minimum contact with North Dakota that are of constitutional prerequisite to that state's taxing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.044" offset="418995">We, therefore, overrule that part of the holding in the Bellas Hess case and hold that the statute does not violate the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.384" offset="460373">On the other hand, the second part of our opinion concludes that the Commerce Clause holding of Bellas Hess remains good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.458" offset="496631">Although we have addressed related issues on many occasions, we have never rejected the principle that a vendor whose only connection was customers in the taxing state is by common carrier or the United States Mails lacks a substantial nexus with the taxing state required by the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.613" offset="565281">Accordingly, the judgment of the North Dakota Supreme Court is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.226" offset="583775">Our ruling today, however, makes entirely clear that Congress retains the ultimate power to address and resolve the complex issues surrounding the taxation of mail-order businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.003" offset="626825">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment which Justices Kennedy and Thomas have joined; Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
