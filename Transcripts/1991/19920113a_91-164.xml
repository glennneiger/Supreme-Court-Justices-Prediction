            <text syncTime="59.955" offset="397037">This case arises from a suit for a refund of the tax on the making of a firearm, in this case a short-barrel rifle, by the respondent Thompson/Center Arms Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.160" offset="437788">It raises the question whether manufacture of a complete but partially unassembled short-barrel rifle constitutes the making of a firearm under the National Firearms Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="82.318" offset="486480">Respondent segregated as a unit... those are the terms that respondent used in its application to pay the tax... segregated in a unit all of the parts that are necessary to constitute a short-barrel rifle.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.776" offset="532247">In particular, that included a pistol, which is not itself a firearm under the act, and a shoulder stock that converts the pistol to one that can be fired from the shoulder.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.949" offset="569027">Now, the facts that were found by the claims court and are undisputed are that the shoulder stock can fit onto the pistol in less than 5 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.237" offset="602151">It's easily attachable.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.506" offset="607166">Therefore, a short-barrel rifle can be finally assembled merely by attaching the shoulder stock in an operation that takes less than 5 minutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.254" offset="930249">That's correct, but as far as the sawed-off rifle goes I think there's some important distinctions between a readily attachable shoulder stock that attaches right onto a pistol and a sawed-off rifle or shot-gun.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.013" offset="10137262">We've argued two rules of construction, namely that a taxing statute, if it's ambiguous, as we believe the Government has manufactured ambiguity here, but then it does... it's interpreted in favor of the taxpayer and against the Government, and the reasoning in the Gould case and in the White v. Aaronson case and others decided by this Court is that if Congress wants to tax something it should say so explicitly, that the application of law to fact should be clear enough so that people can obey the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.150" offset="10265785">But the more important rule I believe is the rule that this Court in the Crandon case last term addressed, the rule that an ambiguous term in a criminal statute has to be interpreted according to the rule of lenity against the Government and in favor of the person to whom it may apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.679" offset="10335897">An opinion written by Justice Stevens in which there was a strong concurring opinion by Justice Scalia talking about, in more detail, the fact that you never defer to the Government in respect to a statute with strong criminal penalties, which would, in Justice Scalia's words, replace the rule of lenity with a rule of severity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.925" offset="10412906">But even if we get into the deference rule, then let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.513" offset="10443209">The Government always cites the second part of the two-part test that Chevron USA discusses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.631" offset="10463689">The first part of that test is that if the statute is clear then there is to be no deference to agency opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.785" offset="10488348">Congress has spoken, and no deference is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.356" offset="10506634">It's only if a statute's ambiguous, and even then those cases are decided in civil matters, in matters without severe criminal consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.461" offset="10542996">The example... the actual case that I think Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist was referring to about a rule of lenity being applied in a tax case was Commissioner v. Acker, where that was not even a criminal penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.606" offset="10611646">It was a strong civil penalty, however, and the rule of lenity was held still to apply, because the conduct was being punished even with the civil penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.378" offset="10654696">But if... even if we were to defer to the Government's interpretation, when you look at how the Government has interpreted this statute, how the agency interpreted the statute, particularly just after passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968 when the agency... well, when Congress determined what is a combination of part... what is a combination of parts plus intent, and what is not so defined, when Congress clarified how we interpret these definitions, the agency began to issue letter opinions where they held that the kinds of items we're talking about here were not considered to be short-barrel rifles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.735" offset="10800146">There is a consistent line of administrative interpretation between 1971 and 1985 that we've got in the record where the BATF said that a pistol and carbine kit is not a short-barrel rifle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2968.097" offset="12029573">--Well, I think the instant attachability at least is a factor, the fact that it's designed and intended to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.518" offset="12055277">And that's not the case here, because here we're dealing with items that are intended to be made only as a pistol or a long-barreled rifle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.857" offset="12084639">So there's a lot of metaphysical issues about the application of law to facts, but I think that, as applied to this product, it's clear enough that the statute doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.999" offset="12137197">Just another comment about the deference rule, because we were talking about the fact that during the period 1971 through 1985 the Government said that the products here are not... the types of products here are not encompassed in the National Firearms Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.293" offset="12210340">This Court has held numerous times that you would owe more deference to a ruling that was set forth right after a statute passes than you would one made up by an agency decades later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.684" offset="12259868">And we feel like that's what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.220" offset="12266033">In 1985, for the first time as we can determine, the agency held that a pistol and carbine kit is a regulated NFA firearm, even though it had held numerous times before that those items do not constitute an NFA firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.597" offset="12335519">I would also point out in my remaining time that the statutory definitions... we've talked a little bit about the contrasting definition of machine gun, for example, from a rifle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.155" offset="12389853">There are also two other terms in the statute that are defined in terms of combinations of parts, but only if intent is present, and again that goes against the Government's theory here that there's some kind of absolute liability combination of parts definition with no intent that applies to every NFA firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.384" offset="12458712">Specifically, the term destructive device, for example, is defined as a combination of parts, as long as those parts are designed or intended to be assembled into a destructive device, and that's... Congress recognizes there's parts that can go together in legitimate ways, as well as ways that would be, let's say, taxable under the National Firearms Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.197" offset="12538020">With the Government's theory of this case about a strict liability combination of parts, we would all have destructive devices in our homes because destructive device, for example, was defined to include a bomb, and that includes a Molotov cocktail, which is made out of a bottle, a rag, and gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.492" offset="12607192">Those are parts that we all have, or objects that we all have in our households.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.611" offset="12619626">So to avoid results like that Congress has fashioned really three kinds of definitions in the National Firearms Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.014" offset="12649197">One of those definitions is the one that the Government argues for here today as to all NFA arms, but it really only applies to machine guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.787" offset="12680335">Capability is the only test in that definition, whether the parts can be assembled to a machine gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.541" offset="12707293">Then there's the two NFA firearms that are defined only in terms of combinations of parts as long as intent and/or design are shown, and that's the destructive device example, or the silencer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.830" offset="12748462">And lastly would be, for example, a rifle, which is not defined in terms of a combination of parts, with or without intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.336" offset="12782526">It's defined solely as a weapon that has actually been made and that is intended to be fired from the shoulder and that actually has to have a barrel of less than 16 inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.941" offset="12824949">So, when you look at the particularized definitions in each case here, Congress has not left these definitions wide open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.749" offset="12872178">It's repeatedly amended the National Firearms Act, probably a dozen times, and it's consistently refrained from defining rifle in a very broad way, consistently refrained from adopting combinations of parts definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.807" offset="12928394">So it's clear enough that if it wanted to adopt a definition that the Government contends for here, that it could do so, but it hasn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="3264.166" offset="13213860">But in any event, this issue boils down to whether the consumer has to have two receivers or one receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.487" offset="13247088">The Government concedes that the complete pistol, the complete carbine, is not a short-barrel rifle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.824" offset="13268508">Nothing in the statute says... or makes this distinction about one versus two receivers, but this presents a much more serious problem by the fact that a hunter or target shooter or any other person who may presently have a pistol and carbine kit made by another company, whether he's liable for 10 years' incarceration because he didn't know that the Government insists on two receivers instead of just one receiver.</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="3326.038" offset="13461292">I'd like to just make a couple of brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.340" offset="13470591">One is, there was a lot of discussion about the administrative construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.311" offset="13486474">We address that in our reply brief at pages 7 to 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.430" offset="13498908">Respondent's point primarily rests on a bunch of unpublished letters written by subordinate officials at BATF.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.417" offset="13522836">Even among those, I fail to see any inconsistency except for one letter that was written in 1973, which we informed him in 1985 was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.855" offset="13560557">In any event, there's a statute that says those unpublished letters are not to be relied on or cited as precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.259" offset="13586262">What we are citing as precedent for the established administrative construction that makes exactly the kinds of distinctions that we've been making here, is a series of revenue rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.282" offset="13618340">Again, we explain those in our reply brief at 7 to 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.734" offset="13632133">Those are published rulings, and under the statute and regulations they are to be cited as precedent and intended to be as... a precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.971" offset="13657106">As far as the existence of combination of parts language in the statute with respect to machine guns and some of the other devices, these... every... it is true that what respondent has argued, which is that each of these attempts to modify the National Firearms Act have been... involved hard-fought compromises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.968" offset="13741011">The fact that Congress overhauled the machine gun definition in 1968 and added an entirely new definition of destructive devices which was not there before and in the course of those two things specified exactly what kinds of combinations of parts and in the case of machine guns what other individual parts not in combination were included and were not, I don't think it's fair to read from that that they intended to restrict or modify the... what, from established administrative and judicial construction, the meaning of the statute had been prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.153" offset="13857831">I just... it's not a case... it's really a case of trying to infer something from congressional silence, and I think that's an extremely perilous course, and I wouldn't infer what respondent infers from it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.461" offset="13903075">Finally, I think the ultimate question in this case is... does not have to do with respondent's specific weapon, but the fact is that many... that there are other firearms that are sold, he has mentioned, with the barrel detached, with the bolt detached, is very common in the case of rifles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.388" offset="13962738">The mere fact that a part or two is missing... it has to be assembled by the ultimate consumer with respect to a rifle, just as with respect to a bicycle or some other form of consumer good, the fact that a single piece has to... or couple of pieces are missing that are easily attachable doesn't mean that it's not the manufacturer who has made that consumer good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.266" offset="14030239">It's the manufacturer who makes the consumer goods and the consumer who puts the final assembly together or adds the additional piece or adds a battery to a radio or whatever it may be.</text>
