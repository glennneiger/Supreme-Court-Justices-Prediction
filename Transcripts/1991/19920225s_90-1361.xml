            <text syncTime="10.544" offset="132959">These cases come to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.374" offset="160336">Petitioners Holywell Corporation, Theodore B. Gould, and several affiliated debtors attempted to develop a hotel and office building in Miami, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.099" offset="211222">After encountering financial difficulties, they all filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.536" offset="236927">In a consolidated reorganization plan, they agreed to place their assets in trust and to have a trustee, respondent Fred Stanton Smith, distribute their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.852" offset="286246">The Bankruptcy Court declared that Smith did not have to pay any federal income tax as for the debtors because the reorganization plan said nothing about taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.259" offset="331803">The District Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed this declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.252" offset="351761">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.218" offset="367643">The Internal Revenue Code ties a duty to pay federal income taxes to the duty to make an income tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.320" offset="400035">Section 6012(b)(3) of the Code requires the assignee of all or substantially all of the property of a corporation to make a tax return for the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.511" offset="452803">Because respondent, Smith, meets the ordinary definition of an assignee, he must make a return and pay taxes for Holywell Corporation and the other corporate debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.917" offset="498465">Smith also has a duty under Section 6012(b)(4) to make a tax return as a trustee of a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.775" offset="533887">He, therefore, has to pay tax on the income earned by the trust property attributable to debtor, Theodore B. Gould.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.548" offset="565025">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
