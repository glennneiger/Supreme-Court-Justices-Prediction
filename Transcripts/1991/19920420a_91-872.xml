            <text syncTime="778.568" offset="3268699">The court of appeals said that the similar motive requirement... and, in fact, in one place they said the opportunity requirement, as well... is irrelevant, or evaporates.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.323" offset="3303703">And we believe that since rule... since the Federal Rules of Evidence were enacted by Congress, the specific terms of those rules have to govern in criminal cases, and the district court was correct in relying on the specific terms of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.802" offset="3353649">What the court of appeals did was make up exception... a new hearsay exception, Rule 804(b)(6), which is where testimony has been... where a defendant has hearsay testimony... hearsay evidence that the defendant believes is exculpatory, and where the declarant takes the Fifth Amendment and the Government doesn't immunize the declarant, that hearsay testimony is admissible at trial, period.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.766" offset="3653535">I think the court of appeals was mistaken about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.759" offset="3661476">But even if they were right, if the... the declarants were... if the declarants were, in some sense, available, the consequence of that would simply be that the evidence is not admissible under Rule 804(b)(1), because 804(b)(1) requires, initially, that the declarants be unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.589" offset="3720826">So I just didn't... don't follow that line of reasoning at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.840" offset="3733783">The court of appeals' error was not merely a technical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.714" offset="3749247">The point of the hearsay rules is that hearsay evidence is not admissible unless there's some specific reason to believe that it's reliable... either it falls within one of the general categories which have their kind of categorical guarantees of reliability, or within the residual exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.035" offset="3810583">In the case of Rule 804(b)(1) that purpose is served by requiring that the party against whom the testimony is offered have the opportunity and motive to cross-examine or to develop the testimony thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.972" offset="3862305">And where a party has had that kind of opportunity and motive, it provides some reason to think that the testimony is trustworthy, since it's been subject to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.219" offset="3895324">And moreover, the party has already done... where it had the opportunity and motive... it's already done what it would have done at trial, and it's not considered to be that unfair to then introduce the hearsay testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.065" offset="3934717">I think the court of appeals' holding eliminates the motive requirement and substitutes nothing else in its place.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.230" offset="3959376">So that instead of the standard pattern of the hearsay rules, where there'd be some reason to think that a... hearsay evidence is reliable before it's admitted in evidence... instead of that, you have evidence that's never subject to any guarantee of reliability or any reason to think it's reliable at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.992" offset="4018413">And, indeed, in this case, the district court held that the... there was no circumstantial guarantee of reliability in considering Rule 804(b)(5), and held that they didn't think... the district court held in another... I think in its opinion that's in the appendix to the petition, that there was just no reason to think it's reliable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.411" offset="6156065">I defend the court of appeals' decision on its own terms as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.762" offset="6173515">For 25 years at the bar, the most uncomfortable thing a judge has ever said to me, and it's happened a lot of times, is leaning over the bench, in a tone of voice used by cats to explain to canaries the meaning of dinner, the judge says, Mr. Tigar, you have opened the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.002" offset="6234433">That is to say, Mr. Tiger, evidence that you might be able to block the admission of is not going to come in because you have done things, or said things, or suffered things to be done at or said that make... mean that you can't rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.517" offset="6312487">Now you could go, for these purposes, to Rule 104(a), which requires a preliminary fact-kind-of determination and say that that's the Rules of Evidence equivalent to 37(a), and use the same analysis you did in Insurance Company of Ireland v. Companie de Boxie de Guinea, saying essentially that the personal jurisdiction issue is pretermitted, we don't have to get to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.459" offset="6384271">Here the Second Circuit said... and it explained it clearly and narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.253" offset="6403497">It's at page 15 of our brief, quoting from their opinion in Bahadar, that we concluded in Salerno that it... i.e., similar motive... could not be invoked by the Government under the specific circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.555" offset="6460653">And when the Second Circuit so spoke, it did so having in its hands something that we did not... that is, these nearly 400 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.682" offset="6493149">When we look at them we see that the Second Circuit was right, that the adversarial fairness goal is met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.218" offset="6523347">The Court in Jones against Illinois... Justice White, Justice Scalia, Justice... Chief Justice Rehnquist, excuse me... also addressed this question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.804" offset="6809649">In Chambers against Mississippi, the Court held that the ordinary rules of hearsay give way under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.137" offset="6839011">Then in Ohio v. Roberts, the Court explained what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.830" offset="6853744">And then this term, in White v. Illinois it took the analysis a step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.084" offset="6870776">You remember, in Ohio v. Roberts, defense counsel, the hapless, poor fellow, went outside and he got Anita Isaacs in, and he put her on direct examination to try to wheedle exculpatory testimony out of her but it didn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.821" offset="6921767">That happens to defense lawyers in preliminary examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.244" offset="6935455">That derisory encounter on direct examination was held to be such a similar motive, that the confrontation clause was not violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.332" offset="6967742">Again, I contrast it with these 400 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.726" offset="6977355">The Court then said some interesting things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.678" offset="6989163">First, cross-examination/direct-examination doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.901" offset="7002015">I think that answers Justice Scalia's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.134" offset="7011001">The motive doesn't have to be very much, and it can be direct as well as cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.827" offset="7025734">And that's what the drafters of the rule thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.131" offset="7034929">Second, the district judge's opinion... Justice O'Connor, you had asked whether it was a decision of law or fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.236" offset="7059380">If you look at her opinion, she said a prosecutor doesn't have a motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.449" offset="7076203">She spoke in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.390" offset="7079964">And then in two paragraphs further on, she did something that gives it away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.373" offset="7095951">She said I got some letters from the Government that say these people aren't reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.156" offset="7111102">Well, in White against Illinois, and in Ohio v. Roberts, this Court said for Government hearsay, that doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.322" offset="7139732">We don't take letters over the transom or under the door that the hearsay declarant's not a nice person.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.708" offset="7953290">In Andolschek, cited with approval by this Court; in Dennis v. United States, there were Treasury regulations that barred certain evidence, that kept it from being used.</text>

            <text syncTime="2111.722" offset="8601336">And that is, the Government in its brief tells the Court... and it stands up here and tells the Court... that even looking at 804(b)(1), we don't think that grand jury testimony should come in hardly ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.302" offset="8663612">We won't say never, but hardly ever.</text>

            <text syncTime="2139.693" offset="8713244">This hearsay, this prior testimony is the strongest hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.078" offset="8738740">That is, Wigmore, and all the commentators have said it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2152.972" offset="8766325">Again, to return to Justice Scalia's question, the similar motive requirement does perhaps invoke a question of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.439" offset="8804150">But there are so many cases about similar motive out there in the wake of the rules... many, many, many... that show that the motive can be relatively derisory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.707" offset="8845215">And I'll tell you if I... I think after 25 years, if I showed up at a preliminary hearing and had a witness on the stand for 3 days and made 10 document requests to the witness, and then put another one on for a day with a subpoena duces tecum, I'd pretty well expect to see that testimony coming back against my client, if the witness turned up unavailable later on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2222.924" offset="9046149">So he... with no preparation, apparently... drags her in, puts her on the stand, and starts questioning her on direct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2288.087" offset="9306746">The D.C. Circuit, in United States v. Miller, Judge Silberman for the Court, then Judge Thomas on the panel, said that the notion of letting in grand jury testimony under these circumstances is well accepted, well established in our jurisprudence, was the words that they used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.648" offset="9369022">And I think that follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.781" offset="9381561">The grand jury, as the Court has repeatedly held, is the Government's playground in the sense that the Court has been hesitant to impose restrictions on Government conduct that are going to interfere with the grand jury's ongoing function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.330" offset="9431716">But once they have summoned a witness and elicited the testimony at such length, the purposes of Rule 804(b)(1) are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.614" offset="9472885">And again, this is the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.679" offset="9493156">This shows that the abstract concerns the Government raised in its petition for certiorari simply don't exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.084" offset="9526802">And there is a final point about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.577" offset="9544774">As Saltzburg and Martin in their treatise on the law of evidence tell us what prosecutors do, and this Court has seen it in other cases, as Justice Frankfurter said in Watt v. Indiana, ought not as Justices to forget that's what you knew as men... and he would say as women, today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.781" offset="9621574">That is that the prosecutor, knowing that there is a witness out there, doesn't know which way they're going to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.595" offset="9648846">Are they going to give testimony that inculpates the defendants... who they've already indicted, by the way... or they going to deny the existence of the conspiracy?</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.250" offset="9687403">If the former, fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.634" offset="9704957">They'll get their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.427" offset="9712167">But if the latter, the prosecutor keeps him before the grand jury because you can develop impeachment material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.801" offset="9737662">That way, when the defendant calls on the trial as witnesses, you've got this rucksack full of things that you developed in secret in the grand jury context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.539" offset="9784578">To take the matter a step further... and in conclusion, if there are no more questions... Mr. Juliani was the United States attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.723" offset="9817283">Would he believe for a minute, hypothetically, a prosecutor who said, oh, I had some of the major players in the New York concrete industry in the grand jury today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.199" offset="9859184">I had them there in secret.</text>

            <text syncTime="2429.913" offset="9874126">I had them there under grants of immunity that I got from the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, but I just decided that I wasn't going to ask them any questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2486.755" offset="10101496">Their... we would not say that in every case grand jury testimony comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.691" offset="10129185">We would say that this hearsay, which is the most reliable kind of hearsay... developed before the grand jury, which is the public's body and not the prosecution's playground, ought presumptively to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.298" offset="10183625">And that if the Government has a special reason, in terms of grand jury secrecy, to prevent it coming in... I think the flaw here, as suggested by some of the questions is that the defendants were forced to put a blindfold on to argue about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.390" offset="10247990">That is, they were necessarily dealing in hypotheticals because they didn't have the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.083" offset="10266798">So that to answer the question to begin with, procedurally, as you do under the Jencks Act, in what's called a Campbell hearing, there ought to be some disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.608" offset="10296892">As the Court said in Alderman v. United States, you could even put it under protective order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.162" offset="10315073">And there the matters were the most sensitive wiretaps, bearing upon national security and espionage case, co-petitioner Ivanof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.186" offset="10339210">So that adversary inquiry might illuminate the matter and show that under particular circumstances there was no motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.333" offset="10375781">But it's difficult to argue about in this case because there had already been one indictment in a related case; one indictment in this case; and in fact, looking here, they did disclose the name of every single major witness in the case, and the name of the most significant declarant, through one of these wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.701" offset="10469195">Coming back to... this is not the case that was represented in the certiorari petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.551" offset="10488630">But generally speaking, I think the Court should be skeptical of the Government's assertions, just as it has been skeptical of the defense counsel who stands up here in the well of the Court and says well, it was just a preliminary hearing, I didn't really have the motive to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.882" offset="10549966">And all of us that had done preliminary hearings know that you don't have a motive to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.377" offset="10567938">Except that the Court has said, I'm sorry, your tactical considerations here are really not our concern, counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.710" offset="10597300">You'd better understand that when you start asking questions you may see this coming back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.366" offset="10619869">So that... that is my answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.616" offset="10632931">But at bottom, the question is, what is the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.027" offset="10646514">It's not just their playground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.690" offset="10653202">It is a body that gives them the power to investigate... the sole inquisitorial element in our accusatorial system of jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.375" offset="10679951">And as in Andolschek, when they then decide to indict somebody... as the Court has often recognized... these considerations evaporate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.532" offset="10712552">The very case that they cite discussing grand jury secrecy shows why that's so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.425" offset="10732092">All of the Court's decisions on grand jury secrecy... the list of factors that we cite in our brief are satisfied here in terms of there not being any reason for nondisclosure.</text>
