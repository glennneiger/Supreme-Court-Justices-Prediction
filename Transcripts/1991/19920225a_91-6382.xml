            <text syncTime="321.602" offset="1436424">Before I turn to a discussion of the standard developed by the Fifth Circuit and Sawyer's alternative proposed standard, I'd like to spend a brief minute discussing the two views of Robert Sawyer that emerge from this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.804" offset="1501208">The first view, of course, is the view that was presented to the jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.807" offset="1517194">The picture of Robert Sawyer that the jury considered was a picture of a person portrayed by psychiatrists, and even his own lawyer, as a sociopath, a person who has the ability to control his behavior but freely chooses to engage in conduct harmful to others; a person who beat up and ultimately set Fran Arwood on fire because he likes to do those things; a person who had been in a mental hospital one time, quote, for no reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.720" offset="1656897">A very different picture of Robert Sawyer emerges from the evidence presented in support of the successive habeas claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.546" offset="1688140">That picture of Robert Sawyer is a picture of a person who has been committed twice in his life to mental hospitals and in fact had been declared on one occasion incapable of competing for employment in the outside world.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.016" offset="1754073">For that Robert Sawyer the world is a very confusing place, and when that Robert Sawyer arrived back at his residence the day the homicide was committed, he was confronted with a terribly confusing situation, because after entrusting the care of his adopted children to Fran Arwood, the babysitter, he thought one of them had been drugged.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.085" offset="1862324">Now, Robert Sawyer's world is a very menacing world, one where people are constantly out to get him.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.331" offset="1899314">A normal person may not have thought that that child was drugged, but Robert Sawyer thought that child was drugged, because Robert Sawyer sometimes sees problems where they don't exist because of his disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.019" offset="1954066">Robert Sawyer couldn't think this problem through.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.193" offset="1970785">His mind doesn't work this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.395" offset="1983532">His mind won't work that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.396" offset="1991578">His mind became clouded with rage and he exploded, his rage feeding on itself, and he beat and brutalized Fran Arwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.923" offset="2037658">Now, there is evidence in this record now... and I refer to the Brady claim... that indicates that Sawyer in fact did not participate in the burning of Fran Arwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.669" offset="2076633">That is the evidence in the successive petition, and obviously it paints a very different picture of Robert Sawyer's culpability and a picture which would be presented and would have been presented if the case had been litigated effectively by trial counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.455" offset="2163777">We have records of Sawyer's two commitments to mental institutions and references to a third treatment at an outpatient clinic in Tennessee: City of Memphis Hospital's discharge diagnosis, chronic brain syndrome with unknown cause manifested by mild mental retardation and abnormal EEG with behavioral disturbances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.085" offset="4674354">Now, of course this validates the Eighth Amendment's narrowing function, the Furman half, but it is utterly unfaithful to the Eighth Amendment's core consideration of individualized sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.246" offset="10971013">I would like first to answer Justice Stevens' question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.078" offset="10982298">Your Honor asked whether the more likely than not standard applied to the prejudice prong of the Sykes cause and prejudice test, and in our view the answer is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.982" offset="11013959">That's our understanding of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.775" offset="11021064">At page 14 of our amicus brief, we cite and excerpt some of the relevant portions of this Court's discussion in Frady which was later reiterated again in Carrier, and what the Court said there was, in order to show prejudice you have to show not merely the possibility of an error, but that something worked to the actual and substantial disadvantage of the defendant, and as we've read that, it seems to indicate that the defendant has to show it's more likely than not that he was prejudiced by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2743.890" offset="11125554">But you would agree, though, that something could be to the actual and substantial disadvantage of a defendant without it also necessarily being true that the verdict would more likely than not have been different.</text>

            <text syncTime="2753.377" offset="11163483">That could, but then you also have to keep in mind the other part of the court's discussion in these cases, which is the cause and prejudice test is stricter than the plain error test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.804" offset="11201204">Now, you could have a plain error that doesn't prejudice the jury's verdict, but it seems to us that if you're having something stronger than the plain error test in the prejudice component, in light of also the discussion of the way you've described it in cases of Frady and Carrier, we've always thought that it really requires a more-likely-than-not showing by someone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2803.841" offset="11365358">For example, the Eighth and Ninth Circuits made no effort in their opinions in the cases we've cited in our brief to reconcile how they described the actual innocence doctrine with the way this Court has described the actual prejudice element of the Wainwright v. Sykes test, and we think they really can't be reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.471" offset="11431918">In fact, petitioner by essentially abandoning the Eighth and Ninth Circuit's approach has virtually conceded that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.265" offset="11455010">What petitioner has tried to do is limit, by limiting the types of claims that supposedly can be raised, the effect there would be on the operation of habeas corpus if you adopted the Eighth and Ninth Circuit tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.463" offset="11503807">In essence, he has said you should limit that test to Brady claims and mitigating evidence claims, and we think the only virtue of that limitation is that it fits the facts of his case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.855" offset="11877462">But the approach we've put forward can be applied across the board, whether you're in a State like Louisiana, which does the narrowing at the guilt stage, or whether you're in a State like Georgia, for example, that does it later at the sentencing stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.632" offset="11988535">In other words, if a court has before it findings that are adequate under this Court's decision in Tison to allow the death penalty to be imposed, the defendant is not actually innocent of the death penalty, and that approach is one that can be applied by district courts across the board in Georgia, in Louisiana, or in Mississippi.</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.741" offset="12104937">In a noncapital case if a defendant were convicted of a crime for which the type of sentence he's challenging could not be imposed under this Court's decision in Harmolin, then he can bring that type of actual innocence claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.349" offset="12151434">We are, if you will, obliterating that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.650" offset="12164600">We don't think that's inconsistent with the way this Court has approached it, because after all in Smith and Murray the Court said it refused to adopt special cause and prejudice rules simply because there was a capital case at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.227" offset="12206919">In fact, we think what we've got here is a system that will adequately work and solve the problems that some people from the bench have mentioned on how to dispose of these cases on the day an execution is scheduled to go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="3106.727" offset="12576917">If he has other claims that he can raise, a State law claim, he can go back to the State courts, because this Court has made clear in Estelle v. McGuire only earlier this term that you can't raise State law claims in the Federal courts, so he has to tie it to a Federal constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.147" offset="12634595">Now, as we said, we think there are several principals that support this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.690" offset="12648806">First, the Court has made clear in Gregg, in Tison, in McCLeskey, one, that the death penalty can be imposed for the crime of intentional homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.314" offset="12679212">Second, the Court has made clear that aggravating factors serve a valuable function at sentencing but they do not define the elements of capital murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.510" offset="12708052">Third, the Court has made clear in a case involving this very State's capital sentencing laws, Lowenfield v. Phelps, that whatever essential predicates are necessary under Tison or the other cases for the imposition of the death penalty to be lawful, those predicates can be established at the guilt stage, they don't need to be established at sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.092" offset="12774403">Finally, we think that given the fact that at this stage the State's judgment should not only be presumed to be correct, but given the fact that Federal habeas has once gone through and completed without finding any material errors that the presumption should be virtually irrebuttable at this point, we think it's appropriate to focus on the question whether the prisoner has committed an offense for which the death penalty can be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.224" offset="12858935">After all, aggravating factors are that... they aggravate the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.518" offset="12876071">If the crime of murder can be punished by death, and this Court has repeatedly held that it can be, we think at this stage of the case it is unnecessary to expand the limited actual innocence exception to take into account these other types of factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3244.618" offset="13128519">Your Honor, you could in essence flip around what happens at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.142" offset="13146595">There there's a presumption of innocence and the State has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.756" offset="13169061">To show actual innocence you could flip it around to the habeas stage, put the presumption on the prisoner and require him to show that he didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.822" offset="13205319">Now, you could require it by a preponderance, by clear and convincing which is close to beyond a reasonable doubt, or beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.654" offset="13228620">The latter, of course, would be the stiffest, but in this context it wouldn't be an irrational way to proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. R. Neal Walker</label>
            <text syncTime="3295.171" offset="13330706">First, for Justice O'Connor's benefit, the more-likely-than-not standard which we endorse is located on page 3 of our reply brief in Note 1, and also the amicus brief filed on our behalf by the Legal Defense Fund discusses that test extensively beginning on page 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.913" offset="13405626">Secondly, this jury heard no evidence whatsoever about Sawyer's mental retardation, or even his low intelligence, and certainly heard nothing about organic brain damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.102" offset="13454422">Third, I believe that we've heard here a concession that Wainwright v. Sykes prejudice is a lesser showing than the prejudice inquiry that we're advocating here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.140" offset="13506563">The Sykes prejudice is that the error works to the petitioner's actual and substantial disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.376" offset="13535506">Justice Stevens, I disagree that you may not have to show that the outcome would have been different in that situation, in our situation you do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.180" offset="13562674">But primarily what I want to address for the minutes remaining is Smith v. Murray, and I simply disagree that Smith v. Murray does not categorically hold that the actual innocence exception applies in capital sentencing proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.128" offset="13618471">What Smith said was, it may not be easy to translate, but it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.433" offset="13643758">Now, the Court found no reason to do it in that case, because Mr. Smith had a claim of legal innocence, not actual innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.709" offset="13672806">In terms of the holding, the holding in that case is purely expressed in this sentence: in short, the error neither precluded the development of true facts nor resulted in the admission of false ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.504" offset="13716065">We have an error that did preclude the development of true facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.027" offset="13734141">Constitutional ineffective assistance of counsel meant that the jury never heard Robert Sawyer was mentally retarded and brain damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.862" offset="13761413">It also resulted in the admission of false facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.674" offset="13772698">That evidence was that Robert Sawyer's a sociopath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.825" offset="13781266">We think we squarely fit within Smith v. Murray, and it would be a gross fundamental miscarriage of justice to not give Robert Sawyer a hearing on the claims he's presenting in the successive habeas corpus petition.</text>
