            <text syncTime="10.740" offset="133839">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.324" offset="152125">The petitioner operates a unitary business throughout the United States and in several foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.216" offset="175740">Because part of that business is conducted in Iowa, Kraft is subject to the Iowa business tax on corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.590" offset="205206">At issue in this case is Iowa's inclusion in the tax base of the dividends that Kraft received from six subsidiaries, each of which was incorporated and conducted its business in a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.857" offset="258287">While Iowa taxes the dividends that a corporation receives from its foreign subsidiaries, Iowa does not tax dividends received from domestic subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.968" offset="294754">The question presented is whether this disparate treatment of dividends from foreign and domestic subsidiaries violates the Foreign Commerce Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.704" offset="333624">For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we conclude that the Iowa statute facially discriminates against foreign commerce and therefore, is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.800" offset="374061">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.428" offset="388585">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Blackmun has joined.</text>
