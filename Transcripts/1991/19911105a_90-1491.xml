            <text syncTime="60.305" offset="382816">Section 547(c)(2) is one of several statutory limitations on a bankruptcy trustee's right to recover payments from creditors, and it protects ordinary course of business payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.814" offset="440808">The plain meaning of the statute exempts all ordinary course payments, and the statute does not limit its protection to any particular class or type of creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.206" offset="486470">We submit that the statute must control the result in this case, because this is not one of those rare cases where the literal words of the statute are in conflict with congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.180" offset="538297">I also submit that this is one of... this is a very straightforward plain meaning case, because what is different in this case, as opposed to some of the other court cases, is that Congress amended the statute and deleted a specific time restriction which was contained in the 1978 Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.029" offset="629726">Under the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, payments were only protected if they were made within 45 days of when the debt was incurred.</text>

            <label>Mr. John A. Graham</label>
            <text syncTime="318.931" offset="1417370">Yes, I agree, so long as that particular business, for instance, let's say, only needed one large working capital loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.571" offset="1447881">So long as other businesses of that type also needed one working capital loan, I don't think that that makes it unusual or out of the ordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.176" offset="1482258">But the problem in this case is that the decision of the court below ruled, as a matter of law, that no long-term lender was entitled to protections of the statute... I don't think because they concluded that it was out of the ordinary course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.186" offset="1542340">They did not make a factual determination that this particular loan was out of the ordinary course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.238" offset="1562506">They simply concluded, on what a... we submit is a very, inadequate legislative history, that Congress could not have possibly intended to extend the protection of this statute to long-term lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.148" offset="1618199">The critical language of the statute, which I think the Court obviously needs to focus on, is as follows, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="376.218" offset="1646516">"a debt incurred by the debtor in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="382.138" offset="1670131">And we submit that there really is no reason for this Court to qualify the word "debt", or to guess at legislative intent as to what Congress meant by the word "debt".</text>
            <text syncTime="390.892" offset="1705135">And that is because debt is a statutorily defined term in the Bankruptcy Code, and it means liability on a claim... which surely includes long-term lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.850" offset="1740975">The Court need not make up a special definition of debt for this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.254" offset="1766575">Turning to the judicial... to the sometimes exception that there might be a judicial rule of longstanding or pre-Code practice, which would require this Court to look in a different direction than the plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.845" offset="1824985">For 80 years, prior to the enactment of the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, there was never any distinguishment between long-term lenders and short-term lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.885" offset="1869184">And there was never any reason, nor was there any purpose in the statute to distinguish the protections and... at the expense of long-term lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.872" offset="1901053">All creditors were protected, regardless of the time limits of their debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.859" offset="1917040">When Congress eliminated the 45-day rule, what it really did was return bankruptcy law to a traditional state of affairs that had existed for 80 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.517" offset="1967718">Also, most interestingly, many cases below, and commoners have put tremendous emphasis on the fact that only trade creditors and consumer lenders testified at the hearings from 1980 to 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.342" offset="2026963">And they say that because other groups didn't testify, there is no reason to extend the protections to those groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.060" offset="2049847">I submit to this Court that the trustee's position that divining legislative intent by conducting a head count of the witnesses that appeared before Congress is really an absurd way of analyzing legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.820" offset="2108883">The fact that one group sat on the sidelines and chose not to participate, either voluntarily or by subpoena to be called and testify, doesn't prove anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.342" offset="2147022">In fact, in this example, the long-term lenders may have been quite content to sit on the sidelines, since the plain meaning of the statute was going to plainly protect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.547" offset="2183803">If this Court were to part from the plain meaning, it would also have to deal with another vice that is not solved by the trustee's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.653" offset="2228211">From the inception of Congress' analysis in 1980 to change the statute, the first group that triggered that review was the commercial-paper issuers.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.777" offset="2268753">And they complained that the statute, which had an artificial time limit of 45 days, was excluding them from the protections of the ordinary course rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.133" offset="2306160">And throughout the 4-year period, it was made clear that those commercial paper issuers were to be protected by the new statute... in fact, so much so, that Senators Dole and DeConcini, on the floor of the Senate, made statements to that effect right before the legislation was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.658" offset="2372198">The problem is that if this Court were to part from the plain meaning of the statute, you would be required to write in another special exemption to the statute for commercial paper issuers.</text>

            <text syncTime="683.006" offset="2873644">I think, though, that the concern of Congress was that the statute, as written with the artificial limitation, was requiring businessmen to change their practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.231" offset="2914500">And that was the problem that the Congress addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.533" offset="2931741">We submit that since the key goal was to protect and promote normalized business... dealings, and to prevent a race to the courthouse, it makes absolutely no sense to carve out and exclude long-term lenders from that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.858" offset="2985030">Long-term lenders usually hold the power to bring a debtor's business to a halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.029" offset="3009690">In most cases, there is one or two key long-term lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.731" offset="3024527">And if the goal is to prevent a race to the courthouse, why exclude that lender from the protections of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="729.337" offset="3058905">At that point, you've taken away the very incentive that Congress gave that long-term lender to deal with the debtor on a day-to-day, regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.693" offset="3092341">If he's not going to get to keep his regular ordinary payments, why not call the loan covenant?</text>
            <text syncTime="742.977" offset="3113553">Why not take more aggressive action?</text>
            <text syncTime="745.096" offset="3122016">I would also point out that although there is much said about the idea of encouraging trade creditors to deal with the debtor on a repetitive basis, and to supply goods and services to that debtor, that is a policy which is covered under subsection c(4) of 547.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.895" offset="3221177">In that subsection, Congress permitted a creditor who may have received a preferential payment, that if he continues to do business with the debtor, he will be able to offset any future goods or services he delivers to the debtor against that preference liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.523" offset="3287737">So there is a specific statutory exception which responds to the concern and the policy of promoting creditors and trade suppliers to do business with the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.033" offset="3353775">I also think that the Court need not attempt to try to reconcile the 1984 Congress' different view of what was the more important policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.660" offset="3424201">The problem in this case is that since the statute is not ambiguous, if the Court attempts to reconcile the 1978 Congress' policy, which there... which favored more than quality of distribution policy, it puts the Court in the improper role, I believe, of trying to determine whether the 1984 Congress allegedly forgot in passing this statute, and deleting the artificial limitation to harken back to what, in 1978, was considered to be a more important policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.719" offset="3580518">We submit that the case of West Virginia v. Casey states that that is exactly what this Court should not do, where the statute is clear, and therefore there's no reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.527" offset="3627747">This is a case in which the Court cannot be faulted for literalism in applying the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.514" offset="3651675">The words which created the distinction and previously allowed trade creditors to benefit and sometimes other creditors not has been deleted from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.239" offset="3698591">Once that artificial time limit was removed, the statute applies to all creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.356" offset="3719071">And we submit that the Court should reject the trustee's attempt to add words back into the statute which would change the statutory definition of the word debt.</text>

            <text syncTime="938.884" offset="3897122">--Let me answer the question factually, first, as to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.169" offset="3910287">In this case, it was a revolving line of credit... although much larger, very... similar to a person who has a bank Master Charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.125" offset="3946127">The choice of whether to pay just interest or also pay principal down, in any particular month, was the borrower's choice by the express terms of the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.147" offset="3986147">And so in this case, the payments which are at issue happen to be interest payments, since the loan was not what we would call a fully amortized loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.884" offset="4021151">When it came due, at the end of its term, the principal would have to be paid in full, or the borrower would have to renegotiate for a renewal or an extension of the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.858" offset="4056991">However, if I might add a point, the American Bankers Association has filed an amicus brief and made the point that the debt of interest, which is distinguished from the debt of principal, probably was a short-term debt, because it was incurred month to month and paid month to month on a regular basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.522" offset="4139643">But we submit to the Court that the issue that has been presented on the writ for certiorari is whether long-term lenders, whether they receive ordinary payments of interest or principal, whether they are excluded from the protection of the statute simply because someone has divined legislative intent based on who testified and some very unpersuasive statements in the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.456" offset="4355414">I stand corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.972" offset="4361474">Between 1979 and 1984, every bankruptcy court in the United States understood that when they were looking at section 67... 547(c)(2), that statute incorporated what was known as the current expense exception to the Preference Recovery Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.670" offset="4444230">That is, everybody knew that these short-term, in-and-out transactions whereby suppliers of goods, utility companies, insurance premium payments, were not within the preference provisions; that these were part of the two-step discussion of contemporary exchanges which do not diminish the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.601" offset="4535972">Likewise, the current exchange... current expense theory provided assets for distribution to creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.957" offset="4577455">The question we have here, is is the Ron Pair decision applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.063" offset="4609847">And I suggest that this statute, the 1984 statute, is... has not been written on a clean slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.669" offset="4648299">It carries with it a long line of judicial and statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.323" offset="4674944">We should remember that 547(c)(2) is part of a larger statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.577" offset="4703887">You start off with the basic... concept of 547(b), which is the preference rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.631" offset="4732100">And the rule there says very clearly that if you received a preference within 90 days of bankruptcy, while the debtor was insolvent, you have to put the money back in the pot, and everybody shares in the dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.156" offset="4786225">The 547(c) exceptions are the exceptions to the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.810" offset="4812870">If we are to look at the exceptions, exceptions are looked at narrowly and precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.147" offset="4838157">We have all kinds of exceptions, very precise exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.515" offset="4859682">We should remember that Union Bank has made one major mistake in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.705" offset="4888416">I quote it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.438" offset="4891342">At page 12, it makes a statement, that the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 protected most ordinary course payments as a preference, and that did not distinguish between short-term and long-term debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.214" offset="4950483">Half that statement is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.797" offset="4960828">The statute did not distinguish between long-term and short-term debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.951" offset="4981412">The statute did not protect ordinary course payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.872" offset="5005132">A preference was a preference no matter what.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.472" offset="5015476">And this is shown to us in the... this Court's decision in National City v. Hodgkiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.541" offset="5039718">That's a 1913 decision, Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.929" offset="5057272">That case involved a day loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.381" offset="5067094">The day loan was made to the broker at 10:00 a.m. in the morning for the purposes of financing an underwriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.951" offset="5097396">The broker became insolvent at noon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.522" offset="5111711">At 2:00, the bank took a preference, took security; at 4:00, in bankruptcy, involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.509" offset="5143685">The decision of that court: it was a day loan; it was a preference... short term or long term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.663" offset="5168240">It was paid in the ordinary course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.615" offset="5176077">It was, the bank got a preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.417" offset="5191228">Right after that we see that the creation of two separate, overlapping and similar theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.356" offset="5227068">One is the... contemporaneous exchange concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.660" offset="5248279">And that's a concept where dollars came in, and dollars went out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.314" offset="5266878">And nobody really got hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.864" offset="5273043">Property came in and dollars went out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.849" offset="5280985">The debtor was really the same, and creditors were not... were not adversely affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.170" offset="5302301">This shows up in the case of Dean v. Davis, a 1917 decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.757" offset="5328632">In that particular case, there was a loan of money; a mortgage was signed and security given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.179" offset="5362278">The mortgage... the loan was on day 1; the mortgage was signed on day 7; the mortgage was recorded and perfected against creditors on day 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.118" offset="5406059">The Court, in that case, bent the plain meaning of the statute, and said, well, it was substantially contemporaneous; nobody was really hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.926" offset="5449318">We allow that transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.545" offset="5459767">Subsequent to 1917, we see developing two, judicially-created exceptions to the bankruptcy preference laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.186" offset="5502398">One is the one I just talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.786" offset="5508772">The other one is the current expense exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.922" offset="5525282">And that current expense exception first started in the world of involuntary bankruptcies.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert Wolas</label>
            <text syncTime="1356.362" offset="5567078">It was not statutory, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.564" offset="5571884">It is judicially created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.180" offset="5582333">Because the plain meaning of the statute would not make an exception for either current expense or for substantially contemporaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.538" offset="5619741">Contemporaneous is protected, but substantially is, you know, just a little bit pregnant, and how far down the stream are you out of luck, when it's not any longer contemporaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.394" offset="5663208">So, we have developing this current expense exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.346" offset="5678986">And the current expense exception deals with payment for wages; it deals with the suppliers receiving money for inventory just supplied, payments to the utility companies, payments to the rent, the landlord.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.771" offset="5736665">And there's a whole line of cases talking about the current expense, and they use words like it was paid in the ordinary course of business, that start off in the involuntary area, and it was switched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.448" offset="5799358">Let me back up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.031" offset="5801762">Started in the involuntary area, because to put a debtor into bankruptcy, you had to allege an act of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.749" offset="5824645">And the most common act of bankruptcy was a preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.718" offset="5836452">So you had to prove that the payment made to the utility company or for the wages was a preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.336" offset="5854947">The Court did not accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.872" offset="5865083">It started off saying but these are necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.240" offset="5874591">They enhance the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.424" offset="5879293">There was no diminution of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.840" offset="5889011">We preserve... we protect the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.292" offset="5898728">Debtor, you're not in involuntary bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.910" offset="5909282">This, then, got switched over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.029" offset="5917745">And then in the cases where the creditor was sued because of the alleged preference, the payment, the creditor defended, hey, I was different; I provided inventory, ordinary course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.087" offset="5969990">I provided utilities, labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.789" offset="5976782">And that's where the current expense exception came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.109" offset="6002069">We have, now, a study of the bankruptcy laws from 1970 on up through 1979, with the intention of changing the bankruptcy laws dramatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.917" offset="6049298">What they didn't change dramatically were the preference statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.034" offset="6065703">In the Bankruptcy Commission Report to Congress in 1973, they suggested to Congress a couple of revisions: (1) to make the law easy to understand, and (2) to make it fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.627" offset="6132158">The easy-to-understand portion was they eliminated the reasonable cost to believe that the debtor was insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.114" offset="6158072">And they put... they also made the presumption the debtor was insolvent when it took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.999" offset="6177612">Because those were two areas that were subject to litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.784" offset="6192763">You had a swearing contest between the debtor and the creditor as to whether or not the creditor should have known the debtor was insolvent, had reasonable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.456" offset="6227453">And also, the evidentiary problem of a trustee in bankruptcy to prove insolvency is tough, because the records are terrible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.412" offset="6259218">So now we have a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.847" offset="6269040">At the same time, the Bankruptcy Commission... and it was also picked up in the proposed judge's bill... recommended the incorporation of what we call the contemporaneous exchange exception, and the current-expense exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.393" offset="6335182">This was done by suggesting to Congress that the definition of antecedent debt, an old bill, be modified to read: (1) a bill that was paid within 5 days is not an antecedent debt; (2) personal earning... personal services were not an antecedent debt; (3) if you pay the utility within ninety days, that was not an antecedent debt; and (4) if you paid for inventory which was purchased under ordinary trade terms and it was paid for in 90 days, in the ordinary course of business... that was included in the suggested language... it was not a preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.088" offset="6517935">From 1973 to 1979, because the Congress did not move too quickly, there were numerous hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.592" offset="6543953">And at mock... at a mockup... a number of mock-up meetings... the intention was to make the law move more smoothly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.280" offset="6582718">Various interests said (1) 90 days was too long on protecting the sale of merchandise and the utility company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.284" offset="6614692">Also, by calling out utility company, and calling out the trade creditor, you leave other people who are current suppliers out in the cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.242" offset="6654607">Is the service man who provides you xerox paper, is this inventory of the business?</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.627" offset="6676132">So what we get is 547(c)(1), which codifies the judicially-created, contemporaneous-exchange exception; and we get 547(c)(2) which codifies the judicially created current-expense exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.142" offset="6762127">But the drafters wanted to make life easier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.094" offset="6773935">They said, let's give everybody a bright-line test on what is an old bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.296" offset="6794833">And that bright-line test is 45 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.998" offset="6809566">I'll represent to this Court that every bankruptcy decision... or virtually every one... from 1979 to 1984 fully understood that 547(c)(2) was a codification of the current expense exception... every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.625" offset="6880096">The cases that the Union Bank relies on, my cases... all the cases in the middle talk about did 1984 change this current expense exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.398" offset="6923146">Now, what do we really have?</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.635" offset="6940178">In the 1980... '80, '81, '82, '83... three groups came to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.872" offset="6969122">The banks didn't come to Congress, because they didn't... in their wildest imagination... think they were going to be exempt, under any stretch of the imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.542" offset="7003812">The three groups that came to Congress were one, the trade creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.994" offset="7017605">And they said, we've got a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.077" offset="7021889">45 days as a bright-line test doesn't work... in the toy business, in the clothing business, in the sporting goods business... dating is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.616" offset="7060028">You ship in July, and you pay for the toys the day after Christmas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.669" offset="7080299">So 45 days kills those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.455" offset="7091375">The second group that came to Congress was the lenders to individuals, the consumer lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.311" offset="7126797">And they said, my God, we know we make long-term debt, and we know we're under-secured most of the time; we've lent on the household goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.667" offset="7160234">Protect us, because 45 days hurts us; we're in trouble with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.087" offset="7185938">Who else came to Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.204" offset="7190431">The commercial paper holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.273" offset="7198686">And they said, you know, we've got a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.039" offset="7209762">Commercial paper is written on a very short-term basis... but beyond 45 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.257" offset="7230660">If you look at the statute as it's written, if the debtor goes insolvent, we have a give-back problem, okay?</text>

            <text syncTime="1807.643" offset="7372139">When the statute was amended on the floor of the Senate, the question was... by Senator Dole to Senator DeConcini... does this statute now, protect the commercial paper holders?</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.800" offset="7632841">And the text simply eliminates the distinction between long-term and short-term debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.704" offset="7656456">It takes out the 45 days, and doesn't put in any other... any other language that contains a distinction between long term and short term.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.904" offset="9801213">Because almost all of the cases that deal with when was debt incurred disagree with Iowa Premium's conclusion, and say you date when the debt was incurred, when the loan was made, when the dollars were paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2480.727" offset="10064527">And I commend the Court to the minority decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.946" offset="10077380">I think it is absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.267" offset="10090650">In the Fidelity case, the Fidelity case is one clearly dealing with 547(c)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.670" offset="10116250">And in Fidelity, the Court made the finding that... the Court discussed the commercial paper situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.459" offset="10159404">The debtor in that case was in the business of making small loans to a lot of people and acquiring its money by issuing certificates to many, many people... not too dissimilar from the Lincoln Saving situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.119" offset="10214052">The Fidelity case found that the... yeah, Fidelity... found that in this particular situation, it was a normal course of the business of this debtor to borrow from all of these people, and repay them on a regular basis, and reloan to all these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.615" offset="10292106">It also leaned very heavily on the DeConcini-Dole discussion, and likened the transactions to ordinary... to commercial paper transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.923" offset="10341321">Next, in the In re Finn case, that was the retailer... the consumer loan transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.945" offset="10377370">That court sent the case back to the bankruptcy judge to make a determination as to whether or not the borrowing was in the ordinary course of the financial affairs of the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.937" offset="10433376">I respectfully submit that when 547(c)(2) was amended in 1984, it carried with it 90 years' worth of baggage; it carries with it substantial historical precedents... both legal and judicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.500" offset="10507564">And that if Congress really intended to emasculate 547(b)... the statute... the statutory history would have discussed it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2676.546" offset="10847783">Mr. Graham, before you get into it, would you tell me what you consider not in the ordinary course?</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.700" offset="10876413">Now, you say the distinction is not between long term and short term, which is what the court below held.</text>

            <label>Mr. John A. Graham</label>
            <text syncTime="2693.222" offset="10914447">Well, I can refer to definitions of what is not considered ordinary... things that are exceptional, unusual, not customary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.578" offset="10951959">But the problem, of course, is that the word "ordinary", you have to put it in a factual situation in order to measure that ordinariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.866" offset="10985083">And I thought that one of the other Justice's question regarding a large business, General Motors, for instance, obviously a $7 million loan cannot be considered out of the ordinary for a company of that size.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.590" offset="11035969">And later I will reintroduce myself to Mr. Wolas, because I am one bank lawyer who would not require, necessarily, great formality in loaning $7 million to General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.296" offset="11078810">I mean, that simply... if it was in accordance with ordinary business terms... you know, there is a third part of the test that would assist Mr. Wolas factually in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.671" offset="11120292">And that is, that the loan must also be in accordance with ordinary business terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.908" offset="11141190">So if you had a $7 million loan to General Motors that was large enough to support that type of loan, and the bank was a large commercial bank, where its lending limits were not being exceeded and there was no fraud at the bank level, then you would still have to go to the third part of the test, which is whether the loan was being made... being paid... being made in accordance with ordinary business terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.344" offset="11266996">And the bank comes to you at the end of 30 days and says look, we're not really happy without any security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.962" offset="11289461">Give us some security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.831" offset="11296880">Now that is certainly not in the ordinary course of business, is it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.402" offset="11315166">Most probably not... if the facts show that one of the reasons the bank was asking for security was a concern with respect to the credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.222" offset="11346513">In fact, the five cases cited by Mr. Wolas to prove that there's a judicial history, that in some of those cases, the action of the creditor was in response to a declining financial situation of the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.331" offset="11406908">And the attempt to gain advantage by changing the terms of the loan or changing the rules of the loan, clearly... in those cases the trustee would be entitled to recover the preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.037" offset="11449749">Congress sought to promote normalized business relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.989" offset="11465527">But when those transactions deviate from the ordinary course... including if they're not--</text>

            <text syncTime="2989.093" offset="12098003">There are a smattering of cases referenced in Colliers where the courts, under the old Bankruptcy Act, struggled with certain types of debts, in unique circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3008.606" offset="12176057">And sometimes in those cases, he received the payment in the middle of the month or towards the end of the month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.410" offset="12195283">And the court, not wanting to declare that an act of bankruptcy, or the court not wanting to consider that preferential, said that that was a current expense and not for an antecedent debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.200" offset="12238438">Those cases as focused on the concept of what was antecedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.004" offset="12253589">And in the new Bankruptcy Code, you have section (c)(1), which says that the payment, the exchange between the creditor and the debtor, does not have to be precisely contemporaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.609" offset="12292041">It has to be substantially contemporaneous.</text>

            <text syncTime="3049.500" offset="12339584">But I would invite the Court to look at those cases, and you will discover that they dealt with either rent, or they dealt with creditors who had a given value to the debtor, after receiving a preferential payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.427" offset="12395277">And the court did not want to assess that creditor with the full preference he had received before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.812" offset="12416802">For example, if he had received $10,000 on an antecedent claim, but then had re-delivered $5,000 of merchandise to the debtor, the court struggled with the concept by saying, well, he was assisting the debtor in the current operations, and therefore would not be subject to preference liability for the full $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.375" offset="12495065">That concept is embodied in section (c)(4) of 547, in which we bankruptcy lawyers tend to call the net result rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.398" offset="12531218">If you have received $100,000 preference payment, but the debtor says ship me some goods, I'm in trouble, I need some additional goods... if you ship the debtor $60,000 of goods, you will only be subject to the trustee's right to recover $40,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.658" offset="12592240">That concept is already embodied in the 1980... has been embodied throughout the 1978 Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.846" offset="12620975">And there really is no judicial rule of longstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.965" offset="12637484">In fact, search as you may, you will never find the word 1978 legislative history, let alone the 1984 legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.689" offset="12684400">The result in this case should be controlled by the case of West Virginia v. Casey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.027" offset="12713762">Because what Mr. Wolas is asking this Court to do is to try to reconcile his view of the 1984 statute with a prior congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.287" offset="12770709">And I think in the West Virginia case the Court pointed out that it is not the role of the Court to try to mesh inconsistent legislation between a past Congress' enactment and a new Congress' enactment... unless the statute is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.748" offset="12836642">Then, when it's ambiguous, you have no choice but to go into the two statutes and try to reconcile them and make sense out of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.885" offset="12865167">But there's no reason to do that here, because the statute is plain on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.039" offset="12885752">There was a simple time limitation which created this statute's artificial limitation to most... which allowed most trade creditors to be protected under the old law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.847" offset="12932981">When Congress deleted that statement, there really was nothing further to prevent the statute to be applied to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.869" offset="12965060">Finally, if I have been mistaken in my brief with respect to the fact that the 1990... the 1898 Bankruptcy Act did not draw a distinction between avoidability of preferential payments on short-term debt and avoidability of preferential payments on long-term debt, then so is the respondent... at page 16, footnote 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.966" offset="13053458">He says the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.318" offset="13058892">We both agree that under the old Bankruptcy Act--</text>
