            <text syncTime="55.735" offset="364165">The purpose today is to uphold the intent of Congress and to promulgate the policies... the public policies espoused by Congress in the bankruptcy laws, to promote unity of the law, equal distribution among creditors of equal priority of the property of the estate of the debtor, and to in fact bring the preference provisions of the Bankruptcy Code into conformity with modern commercial practices and the Uniform Commercial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.878" offset="528736">The specific section which is being challenged at this time is section 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.567" offset="563531">We are asking this Court to uphold and to find that a date of delivery rule for the purposes of 547(b) satisfies and meets and promotes the three policies just mentioned as opposed to a date of honor rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.564" offset="639495">Section 11, or 11 U.S.C. 547(b) describes the purposes, or the events and transactions, by which a trustee may set aside transfers made by a debtor to its creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.394" offset="722774">It does not define within 547(b) itself what a transfer is, nor does it delineate whether or not a rule... a date of delivery rule or a date of honor rule should be adopted in analyzing whether or not the transactions fall inside the preference window, which is the 90-day period immediately preceding a filing of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.712" offset="828099">The facts in this case are essentially very short and very simple.</text>

            <text syncTime="2698.923" offset="10936965">Absolutely, or that the funds may be garnished or levied against.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.042" offset="10949399">So in other words, there are many things that can happen, notwithstanding the fact that these checks are outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.862" offset="10972700">Under 547(b) in essence there is a mandate, if you will, that the trustee look not only what assets are there in the estate as of the date of the bankruptcy filing, but in fact that he take a backward look and look to see what assets were in the bankruptcy estate and make a determination as to what happened to those assets in the 90 days immediately preceding the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.514" offset="11079280">If the trustee, in doing that, and in doing his preference screening, looks on the 90th day immediately preceding the bankruptcy filing, looks to see what's in the account, regardless of how many checks may be issued and how many checks may be outstanding, the fact is that as of that period in time it is the debtor who has control over all of the funds which remain in the bank account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.235" offset="11202160">Again, the issue of control and dominion over those funds becomes material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.472" offset="11227133">Mr. Arland has indicated that a date of delivery rule will conform with modern commercial practice, and he has indicated repeatedly that when a transaction is... or when a check is given the transaction stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.731" offset="11288155">In fact, that's an oversimplification of what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.766" offset="11304351">First of all, I think intuitively one can see that payment by check is not the same as payment by cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.991" offset="11341236">For example, if I issue a check, I'm assured of the fact that I will be asked for an ID because of the fact that if the check is not honored the transaction will not stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.917" offset="11400899">In many States, including the State of New Mexico, statutes prohibit certain transactions from going forward until cash or immediately available funds are in place, and in addition I think that one has to be aware of the fact that the UCC provides that a tender of a check, in and of itself, does not operate to terminate an obligation, but in fact only operates to suspend that obligation and to suspend until it's determined whether or not the check has paid the obligation which has to be collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.744" offset="11576233">I think that under the terms of the date of honor rule there is certainly a unity of law that is presented, because of the fact that the Bankruptcy Code has consistently deferred certain matters to decisions under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.597" offset="11687619">For example, exemptions are decided under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.899" offset="11704860">The fact that a determination of when a transfer is made is to be decided under State law is also consistent with that unity, in effect helps to promote that by in fact ensuring that someone who does business in a certain State is not going to receive a windfall or be unduly penalized in the event that an individual goes into bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.366" offset="11810708">He can also structure his or her commercial transactions in such a way so that he knows that in terms of consistency what is going to happen in the Federal court is going to be consistent with what happens in the State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.459" offset="11871104">For these reasons, we would ask for an adoption or for a determination that in fact it is the State law that controls in making a determination when a transfer takes place, and that in fact the Court reject the implementation of a date of delivery rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2981.891" offset="12068798">I do think the cases that have evolved are consistent, that in fact a transfer of a debtor's interest in property when a check is issued, or when there has been a check issued, that transfer under the UCC takes place at the time the check is honored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.055" offset="12153435">Again, there is no assignment of any funds in the account, and there's no transfer of that dominion or control until such time as that happens.</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.937" offset="12444961">It is the conditional nature, however, of giving of a check and its relation back to the date of delivery that puts it in a unique circumstance.</text>
