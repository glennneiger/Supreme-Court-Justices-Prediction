            <text syncTime="71.396" offset="436067">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="75.280" offset="451531">In 1789, Benjamin Franklin said that there is nothing certain in life except death and taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.956" offset="478280">For 200 years, Congress has endeavored to ensure that the tax part of this saying holds true.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.768" offset="505552">Since the 1790's, Congress enacted a comprehensive set of interlocking provisions designed to ensure that even insolvent taxpayers and their fiduciaries pay taxes owed to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.359" offset="559887">This case involves application of these ancient statutes to a liquidating trustee appointed by a bankruptcy court who in the course of liquidating and investing the debtors' assets realized more than $80 million of taxable gains and interest income.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.100" offset="630836">Since the debtors had been stripped of their assets by the bankruptcy court, they obviously could not pay the taxes due on this income.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.345" offset="663854">Congress anticipated this simple fact pattern as long ago as 1916 by requiring in what is now section 6012(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that receivers, assignees, and trustees in bankruptcy with fiduciary control of the debtor's assets are to report and pay the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.636" offset="740968">The court of appeals concluded in this case, however, that the liquidating trustee is a mere contract trustee and therefore escapes the duty to report and pay taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.495" offset="784436">Inverting the statutory scheme, the court said that the Government should look to the penniless debtors rather than to the trustee for taxes on the income--</text>

            <text syncTime="328.969" offset="1466336">Does the individual and the corporation, do they also have the obligation to file a return?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="333.831" offset="1485771">Under section 1399 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation is treated differently from an individual when it goes into bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.616" offset="1520880">The corporation continues to be a taxable entity even when it's in bankruptcy, so the trustee under 6012(b) has to file a return for the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.723" offset="1561317">In that return, he reports all of the income that he received from liquidating and managing the debtor's properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.227" offset="1591306">It's different for the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.220" offset="1599352">When the individual goes into bankruptcy, whatever he brought to the bankruptcy is a separate taxable entity that is... and the return on that is made by the trustee.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="371.357" offset="1635923">Mr. Jones, the Government is relying only on section 6012, but the other petitioners rely on two other sections as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.855" offset="1689840">What's your position on those two other sections?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="390.038" stopTime="513.467">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="390.038" offset="1710633">Well, as I will attempt to explain in more detail later on, 3713 of title 31 is called the absolute priority statute, and we agree with the debtors that it is a safety net, if you will, that if the trustee is not subject to reporting and paying taxes under 6012(b), he would be required to pay taxes under the absolute priority statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.126" offset="1818989">With respect to 28 USC 960, which is the other statute that the debtors refer to, there are two points of view about that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.843" offset="1865800">Historically, it was enacted simply to make clear that a trustee or receiver was not exempt from State taxation, and the statute only referred to State taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.880" offset="1910000">When Congress recodified title 28 in 1948, for some reason that the legislative history does not explain, they added the word Federal to the statute, and so now it says that the officer of the court shall be responsible for State, local, and Federal taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.503" offset="1984501">Since there is no legislative history, we are in the dark on what Congress meant to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.397" offset="2008011">The I.J. Knight decision of the court of appeals, I believe the Ninth Circuit, concluded that all that the word Federal did was to make it clear that there was no negative implication that somehow a trustee should be protected from Federal taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.307" offset="2075720">That's one view.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.938" offset="2086169">The other view is the debtors', which is that by putting the word Federal in, Congress made many of these other statutes unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.224" offset="2115322">We don't... we haven't taken a position on that statute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.047" offset="2134653">We certainly don't think that the Court need reach it because this case is quite comfortably resolved by section 6012(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is where we would anticipate Congress would place tax requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.907" offset="2194107">The Court--</text>

            <text syncTime="513.467" offset="2204347">You say comfortably, except you really are requiring that the language trustee in a case under title 11 be applied to a situation in which the case under title 11 is completed.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.390" offset="2271952">--Well, we don't agree, and nor is there any authority that this case is completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.543" offset="2292641">In fact, the trustee has acknowledged that the case hasn't been closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.976" offset="2306329">A case can't be closed in bankruptcy when the assets of the estate still remain within the estate, as the bankruptcy court held in the In re T.S.P. case.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.864" offset="2345931">The case could have been closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.555" offset="2356694">It could have been done differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.255" offset="2363485">It could have been done in what they call the ordinary fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.776" offset="2373516">The assets could have been liquidated before a plan was provided to distribute them.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.920" offset="2398176">We agree that that may be the more ordinary route, but we don't think Congress meant this statute to be a shell game that allows an inventive creditor to come up with a plan where the assets are liquidated within the estate but after a plan is confirmed and thereby get out from under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.650" offset="2465049">I want to emphasize that this is in fact a quite ancient statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.185" offset="2483231">It's been around since 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.075" offset="2490754">During the lengthy history of this statute the agency and the courts have all uniformly applied it to any court-appointed fiduciary who comes into control of a debtor's assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.512" offset="2536520">The Treasury regulations, which were adopted back in the twenties, interpreted the phrase, trustee in bankruptcy, which everyone agrees was simply modernized in 1980 to say trustee in a case under title 11, that the term trustee in bankruptcy explicitly included a liquidating trustee or, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="617.035" offset="2618545">"any other person designated as in control of the assets of a debtor in any bankruptcy proceeding. "</text>

            <text syncTime="623.591" offset="2644772">Well, Mr. Jones, I guess you don't have to rely on whether this is a trustee in a case under title 11 if he's an assignee.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.340" offset="2695763">We also think that he comfortably falls within that definition also.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.632" offset="2716974">Again, there is a 60-year-old Treasury regulation that defines an assignee as simply anyone who acquires possession and control of a debtor's estate for the purpose of paying the debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.418" offset="2760129">Under either of those definitions, either of those regulations, the trustee quite clearly is caught, and Congress quite clearly intended this income to be caught for taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.080" offset="2822718">In the National Mufflers case this Court held that an agency... that the Treasury's regulations should be upheld if they reasonably implement the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.377" offset="2863992">Well, no one disputes that these trustees, the income they receive is intended to be taxed by Congress and that these regulations reasonably implement the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.673" offset="2905160">If... if the regulation doesn't... if the statute doesn't reach the trustee, the debtors have no assets, the income would simply escape taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.522" offset="2960540">That's not a result that anyone in this case has suggested Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.855" offset="2977885">The trustee's argument that this is... that in 1980 when Congress amended the statute to insert the modern language, trustee in a case under title 11, that they converted this into a technical term, a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.224" offset="3035355">That technical argument has no basis in the regulations or in the legislative history of the act, which refers simply to the fact that the statute is intended to require any fiduciary who has the debtor's assets to pay taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="849.179" offset="3547146">He waited 2 years, he distributed a lot of money, and when he brought this suit he said either I'm not liable for taxes, or if I am liable the Bank of New York should pay me because they defrauded me and the estate by proposing a plan that didn't provide for these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.649" offset="3609004">Well, it's pretty evident the trustee wasn't defrauded, but it is also clear that the estate was not properly implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.864" offset="3641918">We don't have to reach here any of these questions, though, about the scope of the trustee's fiduciary liability or his liability as an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.889" offset="3677967">We anticipate that collection can occur through the moneys the trustee has and through the indemnification that the Bank of New York provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.006" offset="3718509">I would like to address the suggestion that there is a difficulty with calling this trustee a trustee in a case under title 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.224" offset="3767306">Given the broad history of the statute and this Court's opinion in Bramwell v. U.S. Fidelity, that's a very difficult argument for the trustee to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.382" offset="3807952">In Bramwell, the Court specifically concluded that terms such as executor, receiver, and assignee are to be given a functional rather than a technical meaning in statutes requiring fiduciaries and insolvents to pay taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.558" offset="3860720">The Court reached the same conclusion in the Spring Valley Water case and in United States v. Key, in which the Court specifically said that such provisions are, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="937.335" offset="3899799">"to be liberally construed to achieve their broad purpose of ensuring a certain payment of taxes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="943.170" offset="3923100">With respect to this trustee, he acknowledges he is a trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.461" offset="3940236">He acknowledges that this is a case under title 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.844" offset="3953820">He concedes he was appointed as and functions as a trustee in this case under title 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.558" offset="3976703">He posted a bond as a trustee, as required by section 322 of title 11, and the fact that he was not appointed until the plan was confirmed has no bearing on this because section 1123 of the bankruptcy code specifically contemplates that a trustee can be authorized or appointed to liquidate an estate pursuant to a plan of what in this case is called a plan of reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.575" offset="4076700">When this occurs, the estate continues, the trustees admitted that the estate... the case hasn't closed, the bankruptcy court retains jurisdiction to supervise the trustee, to approve claims, and the trustee in every sense continues to act as a trustee in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.207" offset="4159247">As we've already discussed, if the statute had a gap it would be filled by the words, assignee, which applies, according to the regulations, to anyone who comes into custody or control of the assets for the purpose of paying the debtor's debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.428" offset="4220165">The collateral consequence that occurs if the trustee is deemed to be an assignee is somewhat significant, and I touched on it briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.285" offset="4263632">The United States would have an absolute priority for the payment of taxes under the absolute priority statute, instead of a bankruptcy priority under 501(b)(1) of the code and under the plan, and the trustee would also be personally liable for taxes under 3713(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.146" offset="4343045">We differ with the debtors on this only in that we think it's clear under cases like In re San Juan Hotel from the First Circuit in 1981 that a trustee has a fiduciary duty under title 11 to pay taxes and can be personally liable if he fails to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.210" offset="4411276">To this point, all I've talked about is the corporate estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.563" offset="4432697">The trustee's duty to file a return for the individual is under (b)(4) rather than (b)(3), which requires any fiduciary of an individual estate to file a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.811" offset="4477732">The court of appeals said that this trustee is not a fiduciary because his duties are too ministerial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.272" offset="4499570">In King v. United States the court rejected a similar claim that a disbursing agent had only ministerial functions and was not liable as a fiduciary for ensuring payment of taxes on a bankrupt estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.961" offset="4554323">In that case, the court emphasized that what is critical is the element of control that the fiduciary has over the assets and not the scope of his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.048" offset="4590685">As Judge Cox noted in his dissent in this case, the trustee's duties here were far from ministerial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.655" offset="4625063">He was appointed to receive and manage the assets, to identify and determine claims against the estate, to liquidate and invest the assets, and ultimately to make distributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.101" offset="4666858">Those are precisely the type of duties that a fiduciary performs in a bankruptcy, and prior to this case every court of appeals that had considered the issue had uniformly concluded that a liquidating trustee in an individual bankruptcy is a fiduciary subject to section 12(b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.783" offset="4737598">There are three other issues that I'd like to touch upon briefly that respondents have asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.738" offset="4765392">They have asserted that perhaps this is a grantor trust and that as a grantor trust the fiduciary should not be liable for taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.433" offset="4804158">A grantor trust arises when someone creates a trust but retains the power to determine the disposition of the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.599" offset="4840834">The DePinto decision from the Second Circuit and Collier on bankruptcy both say that a bankruptcy cannot be a grantor trust because the debtor doesn't retain any control over the disposition of the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.377" offset="4887959">Clearly, this debtor doesn't retain any control over the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.619" offset="4908961">They've also argued that there is a bar date for the Government's tax claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.624" offset="4932889">This argument doesn't sit well for the trustee because he apparently was aware of the tax issue from the beginning and made no effort to bring it to the attention of the court as he's required to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.911" offset="4982104">But in any event, there is no bar date for tax claims that arise in connection with the administration of the reorganization plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.886" offset="5013974">Those claims are an administrative expense under Articles 5 and 6 of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.401" offset="5032050">The court has entered no bar date for administrative expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.683" offset="5045216">The only bar that has been entered was with respect to attorney's fee applications as administrative expenses, which I assume has been lifted because counsel for the trustee has recently filed an attorney's fee application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.432" offset="5104148">The third issue that the trustee asserts is that the United States should have been more diligent in protecting its rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.947" offset="5138212">Well, Congress was diligent in protecting the rights of the United States, and has been since the absolute priority statute was enacted in the 1790's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.292" offset="5171649">These statutes require the trustee to assess himself and to report to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.687" offset="5197144">Since he has not done that, even to this date filed a return as required by law, he cannot claim that the United States... any time has begun to run against the claim of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.176" offset="5251165">I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.882" offset="5289931">On October 10, 1985, the plan of reorganization of Holywell and Mr. Gould and the other joined debtors was confirmed and made effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.151" offset="5339041">It became effective on that date, and on that day the liquidating trustee assumed his powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.495" offset="5364432">He had absolutely no contact with this case prior to that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.085" offset="5422738">He was simply named in the plan which had been proposed by the major creditor... the Bank of New York... and his job was severely delimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.280" offset="5455547">He was told what to do under the terms of the plan, a plan he did nothing at all to obtain the confirmation of.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.433" offset="5592220">In answer to the Chief Justice's question, I think there are no other unpaid, unsecured creditors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3519.659" offset="14229033">The trustee did have a broad discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.473" offset="14252334">The only case that he cites for his grantor trust argument is this In re Sonner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.364" offset="14271874">Sonner is an unusual case, because it involved a fiduciary of an individual's estate, and the bankruptcy court simply missed 6012(b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.451" offset="14316282">The court said that there was no... that 6012(b)(3) didn't reach the trustee because that involves corporations, and the court never even considered the fact that (b)(4) applies to fiduciaries such as trustees in a bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.713" offset="14389320">Also, In re Sonner, we submit, is simply wrong because every bankruptcy estate would then be a grantor trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.840" offset="14417846">The trustee would never have to file tax returns under 60(b)(12)... I'm sorry, 6012(b) as a trustee in bankruptcy if a bankruptcy is a grantor trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.165" offset="14467061">Congress didn't think so, and neither did the Second Circuit in the DePinto case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.139" offset="14483048">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
