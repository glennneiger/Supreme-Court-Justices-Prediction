            <text syncTime="50.183" offset="349147">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="55.051" offset="368582">The issue in this case is what standard should be applied to modify... to resolve a disputed request to modify a consent decree entered into by a public official defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.977" offset="424275">In this case, we submit that a consent decree in such a case should be modified if there has been a change in circumstance since the entry of the consent degree that is adversely affecting public interests or important public institutions and if the consent decree may be modified to avoid those adverse effects and still vindicate the plaintiff's federally guaranteed rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.610" offset="522809">In this case, the courts below failed to apply such a standard, with two adverse effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.264" offset="549454">First, the sheriff of Suffolk County has been compelled, because of the single-celling provision in the consent decree in this case, to transfer inmates from the brand-new Suffolk County Jail, which was opened in May of 1990, from that facility into a State correctional system, which is now operating at excess of 170 cent... 170 percent of capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.933" offset="656138">These inmates are transferred from that brand-new facility into a State system, where, ironically, they are often double or triple-bunked or, in some instances, compelled to sleep on the floors of those institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.157" offset="705039">These transfers are made pursuant to a State statute which requires the agreement and consent of the sheriff and the commissioner of correction to make such transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.548" offset="750597">These transfers would not be made by the sheriff or the commissioner of correction except for the consent decree entered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.052" offset="784556">They... the sheriff and the commissioner of correction agree that they are not correctionally sound and have interfered with the operation of the over-burdened State correctional system by placing additional pre-trial detainees into that system; and in addition, it required Suffolk County to expend an additional $1 million a year in transporting inmates from the Suffolk County Jail to these State correctional facilities.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="204.983" offset="968353">And would the change in the consent decree that you're asking for totally eliminate these transfers?</text>

          <turn speaker="chester_a_janiak" startTime="209.920" stopTime="438.818">
            <label>Mr. Chester A. Janiak</label>
            <text syncTime="209.920" offset="988102">--They most probably would totally eliminate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.872" offset="999909">Because what we've asked for, is we have... in the new facility, which opened in May of 1990, we have 419 cells for male inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.911" offset="1040033">We've asked to double-bunk 197 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.762" offset="1051423">Given our count statistics, it is highly unlikely we would ever exceed... go beyond the 197 that we intend to double-bunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.952" offset="1084128">That is, our counts typically have been lately run... typically run in the area of 480 inmates, where we have only 419 cells.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.622" offset="1114848">There are occasions where we've exceeded 500.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.908" offset="1124043">So this would most probably result in a complete cure of this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.526" offset="1138463">The second adverse effect, the keeping this consent decree in place, has been on the functioning of the State bail statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.132" offset="1172944">There are occasions where the sheriff does not have a sufficient number of inmates who qualify for transfer to a State correctional facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.222" offset="1209307">Because under State law, the only persons who may be transferred are pre-trial detainees who have served a prior State felony sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.327" offset="1237728">If those types of inmates are not available, and the sheriff still has more inmates than 419 cells at the jail, what he must do is then submit a list of names to a superior court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.087" offset="1296765">And the superior court judge then takes individuals who are being held on bail and reduces them to release on recognizance, so that they may be transferred to a half-way house facility, which is an insecure facility, whereas the jail is a maximum security facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.697" offset="1359145">Those individuals, the record shows, 10 to 15 percent of those individuals then walk away from that facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.250" offset="1381402">These persons are persons who at least one judge of the courts in Suffolk County... and in most instances two judges... have adjudicated as persons for whom the setting of bail is necessary to ensure their appearance at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.058" offset="1432602">This is a second adverse effect of the court's decision below because it is now interfering with the functioning of the State bail statute in having individuals released on recognizance who would not otherwise qualify for that status.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.251" offset="1485369">It is these interferences with the administration of the State correctional system, the county pre-trial detention system, and the State bail statute that the sheriff sought to avoid in this case when he proposed to double-bunk 197 of the 400... 197 of the 435 cells at the Suffolk County Jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.647" offset="1570946">The remainder of those cells, 34 of them are for female detainees.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.449" offset="1586202">When the sheriff made that proposal, he proposed to... leave in place, all of the remaining provisions of the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.872" offset="1623818">The consent decree in this case provided for the construction of a jail which far exceeds constitutional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.478" offset="1654329">And although the sheriff proposed to double-bunk, none of the other features of the consent decree would be disturbed by the sheriff's proposal for modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.917" offset="1688079">For example, there are outdoor recreation areas which would have been left intact, indoor recreation areas, contact visiting areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.872" offset="1723815">Specialized cells would not be double-bunked.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.891" offset="1735935">Any of the specialized cells in this facility would remain for those purposes... that is, infirmary cells, psychiatric cells, suicide-prevention cells.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.378" offset="1761849">None of the other architectural feature, or other features of the facility would be altered, except for double-bunking 197 of the cells.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.651" offset="1798943">Furthermore, the sheriff's proposal to the district court would have required that individuals who are double-bunked are only those individuals who would have qualified as eligible for double-bunking under the classification program of the National Sheriffs Association, which in this case, was further reviewed and approved by an accredited auditor of the American Correctional Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.331" offset="1881699">And it was this proposal which was denied by the district court, and affirmed by the circuit court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.896" offset="5771958">In this case, the inmates' complaint about the sheriff's plan to double-cell in the future, is like the student reassignment plan in Dowell.</text>

            <text syncTime="1447.489" offset="5938306">What we say here is not that the plaintiff should be deprived of an opportunity to challenge double-celling at the new jail, but that they should do so only on a fresh complaint and under the standards of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.033" offset="6204546">But if the Court looks at Judge Garrity's decision in 1973, it is clear that Judge Garrity was very complimentary of the conduct of the public officials in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Max D. Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="1822.800" offset="7439615">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.806" offset="7471589">The question presented is what standard should have governed Judge Keeton's exercise of discretion when he considered a 1989 motion to modify an order requiring single occupancy which had been entered in 1979 and then modified and reaffirmed explicitly in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.469" offset="7554241">The 1979 consent decree was entered after this case had been pending since 1971, after a 1973 finding of violation, and an order to close the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.544" offset="7610561">After 5 years a complete impasse had been developed and no remedy had been supplied or was even proposed by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.835" offset="7647759">The question was, then, how to get out of this impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.703" offset="7663224">And the answer that was supplied by the First Circuit was that this jail, at long last, will have to close unless the defendants are prepare to commit in an enforceable way to the specifics of a plan... that is, a jail, a site, specific criteria, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.784" offset="7743472">And out of that came the plan which they submitted in October of 1978 and which was approved and which became the consent decree of 1979 which required single occupancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.925" offset="7792060">And then, again, in April of 1985 that, a new order was entered which was entered in light of the fact that the population had been rising and was likely to continue to rise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.601" offset="7854753">And it, therefore, permitted the defendants to build a new facility of any size without any court permission, provided... explicitly... that single occupancy is maintained under the design for the new facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.377" offset="7917865">So this consent decree and its modification had everything to do with what would be in the new facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.717" offset="7947227">We say that there must be a showing of inequity beyond collateral attack on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.923" offset="7984112">This is required by rule 60(b)(5) and by the policy of encouraging settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.892" offset="8007935">And settlements are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.928" offset="8016086">And not only in order to preserve judicial resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.713" offset="8031237">Consent decrees provide better relief, it is more finely tuned, it's more sensitive to the interest of plaintiffs, and more deferential to the interest of defendants, and particularly State and local governments and executive agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2021.776" offset="8235514">But in any event, we agree with the Solicitor General that there must in any event be some minimum threshold standard which is enough to make a consent decree worth entering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.433" offset="8282117">If the parties do not get some benefit of the bargain, if they are not guaranteed something beyond relitigation in the future, then nobody will enter a consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.808" offset="8327570">And we think that if the court adopts a standard which has some minimum threshold showing such as that, then it makes no difference in this case whether the Swift standard is applied or this other standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.616" offset="8374799">In fact, Judge Keeton applied both the Swift standard and the standard that was suggested by the sheriff at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.854" offset="8511785">And that... and that is what we think is the first component of any standard is, what were the basic purposes of the decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="2939.730" offset="11907286">We gave up another 10 years of confinement in the old jail in return for some form... for exactly this, for a consent decree which laid out specifically what it would have and, most importantly, within it... most importantly, and this was clear all the way along, single occupancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.441" offset="11982100">That is what we wanted most of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.958" offset="11988161">That is what Judge Garrity said was most important, what he said they were unequivocally committed to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.083" offset="12136745">That isn't really any different than what the defendants are suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.452" offset="12150224">They are saying we will take the burden on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.637" offset="12158897">The movement always has the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.506" offset="12166420">But if you allow them to collaterally attack the decree, then what would happen is, in each and every decree, every defendant would move to vacate the decree, modify it, every time they thought they had grounds to... arguable grounds to undo it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.901" offset="12239981">And you would litigate these things and re-litigate them forever, and ultimately I do not think anybody would go into them because after all, as a plaintiff's attorney, why would I give the other side the right to blow the whistle at any time and whatever time and turf they chose, say now we want to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.929" offset="12308109">I would rather litigate it at the initial time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.412" offset="12318035">Therefore, I think that it has to be more than collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.368" offset="12349800">And it has to be a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.487" offset="12366309">And that's what Judge Keeton found, and that's what the Solicitor General agreed with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.974" offset="12384282">And secondly, there has to be some showing of need, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.228" offset="12405284">There has to be nexus between the supposed new circumstance and the impracticability of complying with the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.881" offset="12435900">A temporary problem should not be a reason to do away with a decree all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.637" offset="12462962">To illustrate in this case, the sheriff in the old jail had a capacity of 342 cells.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.160" offset="12504967">And for years he made this work, even as the population went up and up and up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.980" offset="12524298">And now when we have the new jail, the new jail opens with a new capacity of 71 additional cells, which I submit to the court that there is absolutely no showing on the basis of that record that there was any need at all to double-bunk on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.327" offset="12609666">Now, there is no other record, no better record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.845" offset="12619802">We don't know exactly what has been happening on this record in the last year and a half for precisely the reason that the sheriff refused to try it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.701" offset="12655224">Another one of the criteria that a court must impose as part of the showing of equity, again suggested by us and by the Solicitor General, is he must try in good faith to comply with the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.859" offset="12707782">He didn't want to try at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.395" offset="12713947">He went to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.411" offset="12718022">So his record has to do with what happened in the old jail prior to the time he had this enormous increase in capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.500" offset="12750414">We say that there's no showing in the short term and much less is there showing in the long term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.404" offset="12777999">In 1984 when the jail was... when the population was going up, the sheriff did not go to the Federal judge then and say, I need to have double occupancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.362" offset="12817810">He went over to the State court and said, I need to have a bigger jail because I am obliged to have single occupancy in the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.218" offset="12853232">So over the long term, the State court has held that the sheriff is entitled to have a jail of sufficient capacity to comply with the Federal order requiring single occupancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.327" offset="12913627">So there's no showing of need on this record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.580" offset="13138698">I should also add that certainly as a temporary matter, we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.366" offset="13153849">We are not saying that if there is some temporary emergency that is totally unforeseen, that they cannot do anything about... if half the jail were to burn and all of a sudden they would have half the capacity, we are not saying that they could not go in and get a modification and order to double-bunk until they could deal with this on a more permanent basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.595" offset="13230753">This was the Duran case decided by the Seventh Circuit and Judge Posner, where the holding was basically temporarily yes, but temporarily only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.987" offset="13276311">And we agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.670" offset="13287073">I should add on this question of need, the real contention of the sheriff, which he makes rather forthrightly in his reply brief, is that what he needs and what he wants is the option to double-cell, the option to double-cell if at some point in the future, in his sole discretion, he should decide he needs to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.853" offset="13379756">And I think there is where the fundamental fallacy is between the petitioner's position and ours... in their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.558" offset="13414551">They mix up the question of the deference to be paid to discretion on the merits as opposed to the discretion to be exercised... official discretion exercised on the question of whether to overthrow a decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.468" offset="13470244">Certainly, on the merits we have to... the Federal court is bound to defer to official discretions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.074" offset="13500651">There are many problems to be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.524" offset="13510473">There are many fine lines to be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.292" offset="13517578">And by and large, it is not up to a Federal court to draw those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.144" offset="13528967">But when you have a consent decree and the official decides I will exercise my discretion, to do it this way, or draw the line that way, and then you get into a consent decree and there are mutual undertakings and it is relied upon in various ways and it goes on for years, at that point the Federal court can't just say, all right, defer to his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.224" offset="13617261">At that point the Federal court has to say, look, is there a legitimate need for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.878" offset="13635860">Because if there is not a legitimate need, if the party isn't even willing to try it out, then essentially what the party has is a unilateral veto over this consent decree, and nobody would ever agree with those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.721" offset="13691240">Another requirement is that the motion be timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.257" offset="13709421">The sheriff waited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.624" offset="13718825">He knew that the jail... the population was going up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.660" offset="13731051">Rather than go and try to enlarge the jail as he had before, he just sat on it, waited until the design was literally in concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.747" offset="13759367">Now this design was designed specifically... it was specifically premised on single occupancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.253" offset="13785385">The whole idea was to preserve privacy while maintaining safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.907" offset="13807955">The way you did it was single occupancy and put the cells in an isolated fashion so they cannot be maintained under constant surveillance, so somebody isn't always looking in the door and watching you go to the bathroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.798" offset="13855602">That was basically what the idea was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.565" offset="13862603">We can have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.767" offset="13867410">Now if the sheriff had moved at a time--</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.820" offset="13891651">I mean, it's a nice idea, but can you require a State to do it as a matter of Federal law, make it a constitutional requirement by just agreeing to do it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3448.545" offset="13942538">--Justice Scalia, perhaps not a constitutional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.097" offset="13956749">But the issue presented in this case as a matter of constitutional law is whether having drawn the lines that way, having made a jail that is built in that way, having therefore created a situation where it will be positively dangerous to put people in double... double-bunk people in cells that are isolated and difficult to observe, would that be unconstitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.045" offset="14052566">And that is the position we think the defendants have put us in by waiting all that time to say I want to change the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.949" offset="14080151">If they had done it earlier... and you can look at page 261 of the appendix, look at the diagram of the viewing limits from the guard stations and you will see exactly what I mean about how this jail is configured in a very unique way, creating very serious damage to our client simply by the way they did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.013" offset="14156429">We could have changed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.596" offset="14158727">We could have made it bigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.796" offset="14163534">We could have made the cells bigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.131" offset="14168863">We could have designed it in a different way... in changing the consent decree, if there were grounds to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.035" offset="14192478">Finally, if I just might say I find it somewhat ironic that the Federal courts in this case would be criticized as somehow anti-federalist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.975" offset="14232288">In this case... this case is a marvel of how to implement relief in a Federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.961" offset="14252246">The Federal courts never imposed the remedy on the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.163" offset="14264993">The Federal court never said how many to hold, how many to release.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.917" offset="14288086">Judge Keeton even made his order automatically amendable if there was a change of an order in the supreme judicial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.071" offset="14316611">No one can say Judge Keeton was not sensitive and cautious about the interest of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.958" offset="14344197">All he did was say, I'm not going to let you out of an obligation which you undertook and which you reaffirmed and which was central to the case without good reason.</text>
