            <text syncTime="728.035" offset="3044436">When there have been garnishment or levy statutes, State statutes which have attempted to reach into a pension plan and take something out, they have been preempted by that language in ERISA, section 514(a) which preempts State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.646" offset="3106816">But ERISA also includes another section that some would call a Federal preemption statute which does not say that ERISA overrides other Federal law, but it says that ERISA will not impair, invalidate or supersede other Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.235" offset="3165226">And I would submit that the bankruptcy code entering the picture fits into that circumstance, that if the all inclusive scope of section 541 of the code, which is to include all of the debtor's legal and equitable interests in property, are brought into the code, that if the anti-alienation provision of ERISA overrides it, then it has impaired, superseded and certainly modified the all-inclusive scope of property that was intended to be included in the bankruptcy estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.667" offset="3290927">If you do reach the supposition that there is not an exclusion of ERISA benefits from the bankruptcy estate, there would still remain the question under section 522 as to what kind of an exemption exists if any in an opt-out State.</text>

            <text syncTime="979.616" offset="4050672">And in the legislative history of this section, the discussion is on the continuing over of the pre-code practice of honoring spendthrift trust protection under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.155" offset="4104903">There are... the two most closely related sections in the bankruptcy code to this one which are 541(c)(1) that deals with what laws interfere with inclusion of property in the estate, and 522(b)(2)(b), which is tenants by the entirety property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.477" offset="4174179">The phrase, applicable nonbankruptcy law is limited to State law in those cases, the two most closely related.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.603" offset="4202705">So with that degree of difference between the statutes, I think it is legitimate to look beyond it into the legislative history to see this indication toward State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.945" offset="4240008">But if ERISA then boils down to a question of exemption, the question in the non-opt-out State is settled, the reasonable needs of the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.765" offset="4283267">But in the States that don't opt out, would it exist as a Federal exemption?</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.508" offset="4306254">The legislative history again of that section makes no mention of ERISA as an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.560" offset="4326525">And in addition, ERISA is addressed by statutory reference directly in the non-opt-out section, 522(d), but not addressed in the opt-out section, which is 522(b)(2)(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.000" offset="4384204">It also points out the difference in the type of anti-alienation protection that ERISA provides if you compare it I think with just about any other Federal protection statute: Social Security, civil service, Foreign Service benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.130" offset="4444808">Those statutes provide a direct prohibition on any type of alienation, garnishment or levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.364" offset="4469676">ERISA, though, provides a derivative type protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.758" offset="4487335">It doesn't say these assets shall not be garnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.191" offset="4501023">It provides that the ERISA plan must contain a provision that prohibits alienation, and that is successful in the nonbankruptcy context because of the State preemption provision in ERISA where ERISA overrides all of the State laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.682" offset="4571032">But with the provision in ERISA that says it will not impair or supersede another Federal statute, then I think that, pointing up the difference in the type of exemption ERISA puts out, is authority for there being no Federal exemption under 522.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.133" offset="4640831">The exemption provisions in the bankruptcy code are essentially State-based exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.387" offset="4665804">If the Congress had wanted to do otherwise, then 522(d) would be the only provision there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.442" offset="4690045">That is why, for instance, Virginia has a $5,000 homestead exemption and Texas has a virtually unlimited exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.046" offset="4724423">Lastly, I would add a word about the rule that the Court has discussed in Dewsnup v. Timm extending the MidAtlantic National Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.865" offset="4767681">In those cases where there is a pre-code practice, unless it is set aside by specific language of the bankruptcy code, or by the legislative history, that practice carries over post-code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.234" offset="4825151">There was a pre-code, and in fact, in some cases, post-ERISA practice that included assets from a plan which were in pay status such as we have here from a terminated plan prior to the time that Chapter 7 proceedings began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.623" offset="4890770">This practice is not negated in the bankruptcy code or even mentioned in the legislative history, and I will submit that that practice carries over under the rule from the Dewsnup and MidAtlantic cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.185" offset="4945001">The inclusion of the ERISA benefits would cover comparatively few participants but it would cover those who have the ability to access plan assets the day before they file bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.834" offset="5003619">And I would submit, if the policy consideration is that we want to protect this stream of income, if the debtor has the ability to take it out, he can just as easily go to Mexico with it as he can, use it for any type of retirement benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.903" offset="5055864">There is no restriction on it, if the debtor can get that property out before he files for bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.187" offset="5073001">That's what this case would cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.538" offset="5082405">And I would also submit, it does harmonize the Federal exemption provision and the ERISA Federal preemption provision by including the asset in the bankruptcy estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.535" offset="5122424">And it honors the pre-code practice of including in a bankruptcy estate those assets which are in pay status at the time that the debtor files for bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.257" offset="5665249">The reason, Mr. Justice White, that ERISA plans exclude from 541(c)(2) is because ERISA requires that qualified plans, the pension plan, the assets be held in a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.778" offset="5727316">It also requires that the trust impose a restriction on the transfer of a beneficiary's interest in the trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.718" offset="5783113">My question is, why doesn't an ERISA plan fall under 522(d), where it says... where it limits the amount of a pension plan that is exempt from administration?</text>

            <text syncTime="1431.110" offset="5856674">--There may very well be a slight overlap between the two provisions, but that is not necessarily fatal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.327" offset="5885513">Section 522 deals with... 522(d)(10)(e) deals with many different kinds of pension plans and in addition to pension plans, deals with profit-sharing plans and other types of interest such as stock bonus plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.679" offset="5958969">It also would cover unqualified plans, such as a deferred compensation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.535" offset="5986346">So the universe covered by 522(d)(10) is very different from the restriction in 541(c)(2) which covers only a small majority... minority of these plans which is the ERISA-qualified plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.439" offset="6065967">And then to get to the section (iii), which covers a restriction for insiders, basically, when a plan is established that says, well, for them, under section 522, only plans that qualify under these certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code can be exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.783" offset="6155410">Again, there are many types of plans that are included within that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.697" offset="6175054">For instance, IRA's would be included, an Individual Retirement Account, which is not an ERISA-qualified plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.085" offset="6208596">Also included, as petitioner mentions, would be the church plans and government plans which are ERISA-qualified plans that do not contain an anti-alienation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.535" offset="6254362">So the exemption would be necessary because those assets are not held in a trust and are not subject to the exclusion of section 541(c) of the bankruptcy code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.255" offset="6321236">Turning back to the plain meaning of section 541, nothing in the statute itself suggests that section 541(c)(2) was meant to refer only to State spendthrift trust law as the petitioner suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.461" offset="6410052">There... the term, applicable nonbankruptcy law is intentionally broad and it is unqualified on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.964" offset="6448086">In other portions of the bankruptcy code, that same term is used, and in each occurrence it refers to both Federal law and State law and not simply to State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.681" offset="6926963">The second reason is that as this Court recognized in Guidry, the anti-alienation provision in ERISA reflects a considered congressional policy choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1753.265" offset="7145347">ERISA is entirely compatible with the fresh-start policy of the bankruptcy code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.181" offset="7172932">Indeed, if a debtor such as Mr. Shumate, is... who is entirely dependent upon his retirement benefit for his livelihood is to have any type of fresh start, his retirement income must be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.311" offset="7237507">A fresh start means protecting that retirement income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.685" offset="7254956">The anti-alienation provision is not dependent upon State spendthrift trust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.240" offset="7297170">When this Court decided Guidry, the Court did not refer to the State spendthrift trust law of Colorado to determine whether or not the pension benefits in that case could be subject... subjected to a constructive trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.949" offset="7900076">Furthermore, many spendthrift trust laws would treat as self-settled a plan where an employee can reach his retirement benefit upon termination, a provision that ERISA requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.900" offset="7955874">For these reasons, Congress choose to preempt the area and to avoid these nuances of State spendthrift trust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.576" offset="7994535">Furthermore, on the element of control, no fact-based inquiry under State law is necessary and no exception is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.774" offset="8039361">ERISA already contains adequate safeguards to protect against the type of potential mischief that could occur as suggested by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.180" offset="8080948">ERISA places limits on the amounts that an individual can contribute to a plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2005.082" offset="8152628">ERISA has stringent fiduciary requirements and the Secretary of Labor is given broad enforcement powers, as is the Internal Revenue Service, which can disqualify a plan for violation and trigger significant adverse tax consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.583" offset="8218561">Furthermore, section 548 of the bankruptcy code would give a trustee the right to avoid fraudulent conveyances made by a person in control during the year preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.773" offset="8275299">These safeguards are adequate, and the type of exception that is being advocated by petitioner is not necessary, and in fact, it would destroy the uniformity that Congress ought to achieve.</text>

            <text syncTime="2265.116" offset="9192720">--The property is subject to an automatic stay, so the creditors cannot reach the property, but the property is there to be liquidated for the benefit of the creditors by a trustee and then equally divided among all creditors under the distribution provisions of the bankruptcy code rather than allowing one creditor to attach and beat out the other creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.093" offset="9280596">And that would be the policy difference that would occur in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.774" offset="9291358">But with regard to what property can be reached, the laws are uniform inside of bankruptcy and out, otherwise, creditors would be encouraged to file involuntary bankruptcies and force creditors into bankruptcy, which is a policy which has not been encouraged under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.497" offset="9366277">Finally, I would like to address for just one moment, the suggestion about the pay status in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.715" offset="9423120">In petitioner's brief and response, it suggests that this case was already in a pay status and suggests a date that was subsequent to the filing of the bankruptcy petition by Mr. Shumate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.084" offset="9488635">Mr. Shumate filed bankruptcy a month before the date that petitioner contends the plan was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.381" offset="9517787">In fact, this plan, the trust, held these assets for 3 years after the date that petitioner suggests was the termination date, which I would suggest is an artificial date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.740" offset="9567211">And in any event, a bankruptcy estate is created under section 541 upon the filing of the bankruptcy petition and not upon any date of conversion, and section 348 bears that out in the bankruptcy code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.521" offset="9638369">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher J. Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="2384.118" offset="9668775">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.205" offset="9709108">Two of my main points have been made by the Court and so let me try to deal with them very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.997" offset="9732201">First, I think it has been pointed out that the linchpin of the bankruptcy trustee's position is that ERISA is not an applicable nonbankruptcy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.195" offset="9773056">But it certainly would seem on the face of those words that ERISA is applicable nonbankruptcy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.188" offset="9805030">Indeed, the Fifth Circuit, which ruled contrary to our position in Goff, acknowledged the facially broad language of the statute and went on not to follow the facially broad language of the statute because it felt that the legislative history suggested that applicable nonbankruptcy law was limited to State spendthrift trust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.767" offset="9911296">I would suggest that that is not a proper way to read the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.821" offset="9927492">Applicable nonbankruptcy would seem to cover ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.634" offset="9942747">If that is so, then in those cases where a pension plan has an anti-alienation provision, mandated by ERISA, then the benefits are excluded from the bankruptcy estate under the plain language of the exclusion provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.345" offset="10013592">The second point that has also been made is that the exemption provisions are not contrary to the straightforward reading that I have just tried to give to the exclusion provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.854" offset="10063642">The exemption provision that petitioner has focused on today is the 522(d)(10)(e) provision which discusses pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.432" offset="10105961">The Court seems to understand clearly two points about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.625" offset="10126754">First, that provision covers all sorts of pension plans, not just pension plans that qualify for tax benefits under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.491" offset="10170222">If a... those sorts of pension plans, those that aren't qualified under ERISA, of course, do not contain an ERISA-mandated anti-alienation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.860" offset="10215675">And in cases involving such benefits, they would not necessarily be excluded from the bankruptcy estate and therefore might be subject to exemption under 522(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.249" offset="10265203">Let me add that there are three significant categories of pension plans that qualify for tax benefits under ERISA, and yet are not required by the statute to have an anti-alienation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.959" offset="10320060">And those are governmental pension plans, church pension plans and Individual Retirement Accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.414" offset="10345869">Again, under our reading of the statute, those plans are not necessarily excluded from the bankruptcy estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.892" offset="10379828">Interests in such plans would only be excluded if they happen to qualify under State spendthrift trust law, but interest in such plans are subject to exemption under section 522(d)(10)(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.023" offset="10436357">And without section 522(d)(10)(e), interest in such plans might be totally distributed to creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.557" offset="10474496">So section 522(d)(10)(e) serves the very important function, in cases involving Individual Retirement Accounts, governmental plans and church plans, of protecting pension assets to the extent reasonably necessary to the creditor's fresh start.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.820" offset="10543564">If applicable nonbankruptcy law is read to include ERISA, then the statutes harmonize and the anti-alienation provision is given its full force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.581" offset="10602601">If it is read in the restrictive manner that petitioner proposes there is a real clash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.375" offset="10625797">The anti-alienation provision is not given its force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.987" offset="10640217">We contend that it would be doubly erroneous to read applicable nonbankruptcy law not in a straightforward manner in order to induce a clash between two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.087" offset="10692566">It should be read straightforwardly to harmonize the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.508" offset="10710329">Many Federal agencies are, of course, frequently creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.055" offset="10732481">We considered that carefully and concluded, nevertheless, that the language of ERISA and the language of the bankruptcy code compel the conclusion that pension benefits, protected by ERISA's mandatory anti-alienation provision may not be distributed to creditors, either in or outside of bankruptcy, and that is our submission to this Court.</text>

          <turn speaker="g_steven_agee" startTime="2681.143" stopTime="2863.348">
            <label>Mr. G. Steven Agee</label>
            <text syncTime="2681.143" offset="10856824">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.468" offset="10878140">I have only three points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.781" offset="10887335">With respect to the Guidry case, the first major distinction of Guidry is of course that it was not a bankruptcy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.696" offset="10918996">Unlike a lot of previous decisions that dealt with the application of ERISA protecting benefits from State law claims, Guidry did involve another Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.581" offset="10962568">But the point of distinction, as I recall the course of opinion, was that the statute in effect there, the Labor Management Relations Act, had its own savings clause, its own preemption provision that said it would not interfere with another Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.542" offset="11022441">And the Court concluded, in effect, that the ERISA provision that says it will not modify or impair other Federal law, the two trumped each other and therefore ERISA could prevail over the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.251" offset="11073223">But in this case there is no similar provision in the bankruptcy code and there is no exception in ERISA or anywhere else that I am aware of, from this Federal preemption provision within ERISA itself that would make the bankruptcy code subservient to ERISA in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.810" offset="11131528">There is some discussion of the concept of the fresh start, which is an important part of the bankruptcy codes provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.206" offset="11161098">But in this particular case, I would submit that the fresh start is not at all what was anticipated in drafting the bankruptcy code where you have an exemption for the tools of the trade, some small exemption for household goods, things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.575" offset="11218568">Because in this case, if the decision is in favor of the debtor, the debtor simply goes to the clerk's office, takes his check, can get on the first plane if he or she chooses to do so and they are gone to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.034" offset="11272380">They can spend the entire proceeds in the gaming house the very first day that they are gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.898" offset="11291815">There is no requirement, there is no protection of the stream of income for retirement purposes in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.814" offset="11327551">And lastly, to speak about the harmonization of the various code sections, this provision within ERISA that says it will not supersede or impair other Federal law functions like the all-inclusive scope of the bankruptcy estate under section 541 is harmonized with this reasonable needs exemption in section 522 that deals with those exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.692" offset="11435071">So I submit there is a harmonization by reading the code as the bankruptcy trustee suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.745" offset="11459208">And I would submit to the Court that to honor the plain meaning of this reasonable needs exemption in bankruptcy under 522, there should be no exclusion from the estate under 541(c)(2) and that the bankruptcy code's preexisting practice dealing with benefits that are prepared for distribution and ready for payment when the debtor enters into bankruptcy proceedings should carry over, post-code and apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.836" offset="11579580">I thank the Court.</text>
