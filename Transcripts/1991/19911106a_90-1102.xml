            <text syncTime="67.114" offset="412837">He brought this lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the collection of compulsory bar dues that are used for political and ideological purposes, and on a first appeal the 11th Circuit held that the bar, indeed, was violating his First Amendment rights by using his compulsory dues for political and ideological purposes unrelated to the bar's core regulatory functions, thus anticipating this Court's decision in Keller v. California State Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.655" offset="534986">The 11th Circuit remanded the case for the district court to determine which of the past positions taken by the bar were constitutionally permissible and impermissible uses of Mr. Gibson's dues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.923" offset="5680063">The nonmember can then make a single general objection, saying I think you've calculated the dues amount too high, that some of the activities you've included I don't agree with, but he doesn't have to specify what they are at that stage because that would violate the principle of Abood that he does not have to disclose his beliefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1707.588" offset="6974692">With the Court's permission, I would like to begin by addressing questions that were raised by Justice Kennedy and Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.694" offset="7003113">With regard to the Frankel decision, counsel has suggested that the Frankel decision was limited solely to legislative positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.419" offset="7034042">The reason for that is because those were the only positions that were challenged in the Frankel case by the petitioners, just as they are the only petitions... the only positions that have been challenged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.309" offset="7081585">However, it is clear from this Court's decisions that the Abood criteria, the requirements of Hudson, are not limited to legislative lobbying positions, and as far as the Florida bar is concerned, it reads its own Supreme Court decision as being as extensive as are the decisions of this Court in Keller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.645" offset="7170924">It is our opinion that it would make no sense, as Justice Kennedy suggested, for the Florida supreme court to attempt to distinguish between the two and so, as we understand that ruling, we are limited as to all political and ideological purposes to the parameters of Keller and Abood.</text>

            <label>Mr. Barry Scott Richard</label>
            <text syncTime="1783.654" offset="7278966">Second, Your Honor, with regard to Justice Kennedy's suggestion that perhaps this case is moot if not insignificant, while it may be that with regard to Florida it is moot, the fact is a split continues to exist in the various circuits, and because this Court may want to address this issue, I will address it regardless of whether or not the Florida supreme court had taken the position that it did in the Frankel case, and I will do that in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.261" offset="7385441">First, however, I would like to also address the question that was raised by Justice White regarding whether or not injunction would be at... whether or not that Florida's interpretation... that Florida's interpretation of the Frankel case... is consistent with this Court's ruling in Keller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.924" offset="7456076">It is our position that it is, indeed, consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.434" offset="7466107">As this Court said in Keller, the issue is not the terminology but the manner in which it has been interpreted by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.229" offset="7493275">The reason that this Court struck down the California court's interpretation is because even though, as this Court noted, its language appeared to be the same as the language of this Court, it had so broadly interpreted it that it essentially allowed any lobbying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.990" offset="7556282">Quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.462" offset="7562238">In its first test of the criteria that it had earlier established in the Schwarz case, the Florida supreme court gave an extremely narrow interpretation which clearly falls within the scope of Keller, and essentially what the Florida supreme court said in interpreting those additional three criteria was that it must be... that when they say that it must be an issue upon which attorneys have special expertise, that means it must have to do with the administration of the system of justice as opposed to the subject matter of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.934" offset="7688044">Now, the essential point here is that this Court does not have before it now a case in which the interpretation by the Florida supreme court by anybody's measure is beyond Keller or Abood, and there will be no issue until such time as a petitioner brings a case to this Court or another Federal court in which the Florida courts have interpreted it in an expansive manner that violates those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.481" offset="7778323">Now, what I would like to do is to address this question, as I said, in an even broader sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.796" offset="7803505">I think, as comments from the Justices have already indicated, that there is no question that given the current interpretation by Florida's supreme court, that this case squarely meets the requirements of Abood and of Keller with regard to advance reduction, but I would suggest to this Court that even before the Frankel decision, and even with respect to those States that have not gone so far as Florida, advance reduction which has never been mandated by this Court simply makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.945" offset="7916145">It rests upon the assumption that there is only one interest here to be served, the interest of the dissenters, and that that interest is to be served and that the convenience of the dissenters is to be served without regard for any other interest, and that flies in the face of what this Court has said consistently when it has cautioned district courts that they are to balance the interests of the dissenters against the right and the necessity for the organization to have the ability to fund those activities which are germane, and there is no way, I would respectfully suggest to this Court, that advance reduction can accomplish that purpose, and I will illustrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.305" offset="8089598">Let us assume that the dissenters have demanded their escrow and that a determination has been made at some point that it was 10 percent of the budget, and they have received their 10 percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.297" offset="8189490">Let's assume the most extreme circumstance in which the determination was in their favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.669" offset="8211015">Now, in what manner are you to reduce next year, when what we are talking about... well, let me put it this way, there are some circumstances in which reduction is certainly practicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.186" offset="8249050">For instance, if you've got a labor union which knows that it is going to allocate 10 percent of its budget to campaign contributions, surely that's a simple matter of reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.936" offset="8296070">However, if you're dealing with a legislative situation, then as Justice Souter mentioned in the Chapman case in New Hampshire, it's an extremely complicated and never a wholly satisfactory system to advance reduce, because what do you reduce?</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.974" offset="8344240">Florida's court is typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.696" offset="8355107">It budgets a lump sum amount to lobbying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.580" offset="8366705">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.831" offset="8367645">Because nobody knows what percentage of lobbying is going to go to what issues in any given year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.534" offset="8386454">Nobody knows what issues are coming up, nobody knows how many committees are going to take up a bill, nobody knows until it's all over, and then what you do is you sit down and you allocate it according to the percentage of the time that your lobbyists spent on one issue or another issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2873.958" offset="11640161">The Florida supreme court in this case was not acting in an adjudicatory capacity with regard to the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.683" offset="11667120">They were acting as the administrative head of the Florida bar, which in Florida the supreme court is, and they were advising the Florida bar that they could not extend beyond Keller in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.713" offset="11719156">The injunction was secondary, because the Court was saying this is an appropriate remedy, but the fact is that it was certainly the intention of the Court to advise the bar of, its administrative limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.869" offset="11759802">They said, your charter allows you not to go beyond this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.383" offset="11769833">With regard to the issue of notice, Your Honor, the Florida bar publishes all of the notice that I believe is reasonably possible, as well as all of the notice that is constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.942" offset="11836080">We have a rule adopted and imposed by the supreme court that requires Florida to give notice of the entire budget process, point by point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.177" offset="11869099">We give notice to the membership as soon as it is adopted of every item in the budget, we give notice as the Court knows of every position taken politically.</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.828" offset="11915701">If the petitioners are suggesting that we need to break the budget down into smaller quantities, I know of no constitutional provision that requires the Florida bar or any other agency to break its budget down into any particular size items.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.659" offset="11974947">The point is, we're not, as is suggested in the brief of the petitioners, being disingenuous here or being arrogant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.104" offset="12000756">We are simply adopting the only budget that the bar is able to adopt, and we are attempting, as I believe most if not all bars and this Court is, to struggle with the question of how to balance the legitimate rights of the petitioners against the necessity to ensure that the costs involved are evenly spread with regard to legitimate, germane functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3036.536" offset="12290506">I think both are required if the bar is not limited by State law to only constitutionally chargeable purposes.</text>
