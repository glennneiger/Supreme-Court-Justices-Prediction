            <text syncTime="9.456" offset="128591">This case comes to us on appeal from a three-judge District Court in the District of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.926" offset="154504">Article I Section 2 of the Constitution requires apportionment of representatives among the several states according to their respective numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.075" offset="195151">A statute enacted by Congress in 1941 provides that seats in the House of Representatives are apportioned among the states by a method known as the method of equal proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.408" offset="240499">In the apportionment following the 1990 Census, Montana's representation in the House of Representatives was reduced form two seats to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.056" offset="279056">The state and various officials brought suit alleging that the method of equal proportions resulted in the distribution of representatives that violated the principle of equal representation that this Court has found to be required in the context of intrastate districting decisions, those made by a state legislature affecting the districts within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.242" offset="371739">A majority of the three-judge District Court agreed with Montana and held that the apportionment statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.941" offset="410609">The District Court relied on our cases holding that when a state legislature defines congressional districts, it must make a good faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.531" offset="456898">As our cases involving variances of only a fraction of 1% demonstrate, that goal is realistic and appropriate for state districting decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.358" offset="496290">In this case, however, whether Montana has one district or two, its variance from the ideal district will exceed 40%.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.690" offset="533593">The constitutional guarantee of a minimum of one representative for each state in execrably compels a significant departure from the ideal.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.633" offset="569329">In Alaska, Vermont, and Wyoming where the statewide districts are less populous than the ideal district, every vote is more valuable than the national average.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.636" offset="609348">Moreover, the need to allocate a fix number of indivisible representatives among 50 states of varying populations makes it virtually impossible to have the same size district in any pair of states, let alone in all 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.891" offset="674341">Accordingly, although common sense supports a test requiring a good faith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality within each state, the constraints impose by Article I Section 2, itself, make that goal illusory for the nation as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.102" offset="739229">In view of the constitutional constraints on the apportionment of representatives, any method will result in substantial differences between the sizes of congressional districts in different states.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.458" offset="788653">A congressional decision to adapt the equal proportions method apparently reflected a good faith effort to establish a fair apportionment of representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.157" offset="823448">We cannot say that the alternative methods proposed by Montana would better fulfill the constitutional principle of equal representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.269" offset="855944">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.335" offset="868170">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
