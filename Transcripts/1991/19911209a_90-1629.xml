            <text syncTime="97.497" offset="528951">The... to continue, the trustee in bankruptcy appointed for the respondent in this case, Nordic Village, brought this adversary proceeding and recovered a 20,000 dollar money judgment against the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.856" offset="590391">The Sixth Circuit upheld the judgement on the ground that the United States had waived sovereign immunity under section 106(c) of the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.195" offset="627694">Thus, the issue is whether section 106(c) of the code authorizes a bankruptcy trustee to recover money from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.468" offset="664788">This Court previously addressed the scope of section 106(c) in a case involving an individual State, namely, Hoffman v. Connecticut Department of Income Maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.693" offset="713689">In Hoffman, the Court concluded that section 106(c) does not authorize monetary relief against the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.631" offset="745454">We submit that the same conclusion should apply in cases involving the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.802" offset="770113">The facts of this case are undisputed and may be summarized briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.772" offset="790071">Nordic Village was a restaurant in Lake County, Ohio, that filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 in March 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.462" offset="824762">After the petition was filed, the IRS filed a proof of claim against the estate seeking payment of overdue employment taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.549" offset="857153">Also, after the petition was filed, an officer of Nordic Village, Josef Lah, drew a check for 26,000 dollars on Nordic Village's corporate bank account which he used to get a 20,000 dollar cashier's check payable to the IRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.743" offset="921937">Mr. Lah delivered the 20,000 dollar check to the IRS and had them apply it against his personal taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.683" offset="953702">The trustee for Nordic Village then brought this action seeking to recover the 20,000 dollar payment on the grounds that it was an unauthorized postpetition transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.722" offset="993826">The bankruptcy court agreed, and held that the transfer was voidable, and entered the 20,000 dollar judgment against IRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.995" offset="1026949">And the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.464" offset="1048788">On appeal to the Sixth Circuit, the Government argued that the 20,000 dollar judgment was barred by sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.868" offset="1078463">The Government relied on the decision in Hoffman.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.337" offset="1092255">Hoffman, like this case, involved a voidable payment of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.224" offset="1111795">In Hoffman, as here, the trustee argued that section 106(c) of the code authorized recovery.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>

            <text syncTime="267.423" offset="1208657">I don't think that the Government was aware the availability of the argument before then.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.777" offset="1234048">In Hoffman, the Court rejected the argument that recovery of a voidable tax payment was authorized under section 106(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="281.516" offset="1264977">In an opinion written by Mr. Justice White, a plurality of the Court concluded that section 106(c) cannot be construed to authorize retroactive monetary relief against the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.324" offset="1312206">Mr. Justice Scalia concurred in that conclusion on the ground that Congress lacks authority under the bankruptcy clause to subject unconsenting States to retroactive monetary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.049" offset="1359122">In this case, the Sixth Circuit declined to follow the plurality's interpretation in Hoffman and adopted instead the views of the dissenting members in Hoffman.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.987" offset="1398933">Thus, the court upheld the judgement against the Federal Government, which it recognized could not be entered against a State.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="322.010" offset="1426936">Do you think the requirements for a clear statement are the same in waiving Federal sovereign immunity as they are for finding abrogation of a State Eleventh Amendment immunity?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard H. Seamon</label>
            <text syncTime="337.370" offset="1488376">They are very closely similar and have been described in virtually identical terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.174" offset="1511677">I would suggest that there is... there may well be some difference between the formulation in the Atascadero case of the clear statement rule and the standard for Federal sovereign immunity cited in a case like Ruckelshaus.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.099" offset="1575312">But I don't think that... in any event, I don't think that Congress would have discerned a difference between the two statements, especially at the time it was drafting the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.472" offset="1612824">And in any event, I think in drafting the statute at issue here, clearly it didn't intend to have a different rule apply to the States as opposed to the United States based on any difference in the standards for waiving the two forms of immunity.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="386.101" offset="1683354">Of course, the incompatibility you describe only exists if you assume that the judgment of the court was based upon the rationale of the plurality opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.856" offset="1718358">There's no incompatibility at all if the judgment of the court is thought to have been based on the rationale of the concurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.414" offset="1756602">That is to say, it's quite feasible that Congress may... might want to waive its own sovereign immunity, but does not have the power to waive the sovereign immunity of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.520" offset="1793068">There's nothing strange about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.653" offset="1801532">No, there is nothing strange about that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.805" offset="1810205">And in fact, in certain other statutes, Congress has drawn a distinction between suits against the United States and suits against individual States.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.578" offset="1845209">I would cite as an example some of the citizen suit provisions in the environmental statutes like RCRA and CRCLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.266" offset="1876033">You can bring a citizen's suit against the United States and then against State entities to the extent permitted by the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.520" offset="1904977">The Congress didn't draw the distinction in this case, even though it recognized that there were limitations on its power with regard to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.543" offset="1941131">And I would suggest that the fact that it didn't draw a distinction on the face of the statute, but recognized a limit in terms of its power over the States suggests that it wanted to waive Federal sovereign immunity to the same extent it believed it could abrogate State sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.522" offset="2021065">You're telling us that, in the Clean Water Act and those other citizen suit provisions, Congress has adopted different standards for the waiver of the Federal sovereign immunity, of the waiver of the Eleventh Amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="487.318" offset="2088252">I'm saying that when Congress is legislating close to the limits of what it thinks that its constitutional authority is, and it intends to allow actions against both kinds of sovereigns, in certain cases it will embody in the statute itself its recognition that maybe some suits against the Federal Government would be permitted, even though the same suit wouldn't permitted against the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="623.921" offset="2634629">That issue is not before the Court, and that's why we didn't raise it in our brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.092" offset="2663259">It is correct that the incompatibility in this case only exists between the result in Hoffman and the result reached by the Sixth Circuit below.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.214" offset="2703802">Nonetheless, we believe that the plurality in Hoffman construed section 106(c) correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.785" offset="2730133">It does not clearly authorize monetary relief against Governmental units.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.005" offset="2755002">And because I'm going to begin by talking about the language of section 106, I would refer the Court to the appendix to our petition at page 57a where section 106 is reprinted.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.650" offset="2821562">Section 106(c), which is the provision at issue here, was added late in the legislative process and in some respects, it is not a model of drafting clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.441" offset="2868686">Therefore, section 106(c) is best understood in the context of section 106 as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.612" offset="2897421">Sections 106(a) and (b) are the provisions that Congress clearly designed to deal comprehensively with the problem of money claims against governmental units.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.586" offset="2945277">That is clear because section 106(a) and (b) use the word claim, which is defined in the code to mean any right to payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.127" offset="2983416">Thus, section 106(a) and (b) considered together address all money claims that a trustee may have against the Government, whether they arise under a provision of the code or come from a source outside of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.404" offset="3044543">While 106(a) and (b) are quite comprehensive in the sense that they address all money claims, they're quite restrictive in setting forth conditions for recovering the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.659" offset="3085607">106(a) allows affirmative recovery only when the Government has filed a claim against the estate, and the estate has a compulsory counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.217" offset="3127821">That is a very narrow category of cases that would permit affirmative monetary relief of the sort that was awarded here.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.704" offset="3157810">106(b) is slightly broader in scope inasmuch as it reaches permissive counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.358" offset="3180379">By the same token, it limits the kind of relief available.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.393" offset="3196471">Under section 106(b), the trustee can only get an offset of the estate's claim with respect to the Government's claim against the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.265" offset="3231997">And as is clear, 106(a) and (b) both apply only when the Government has filed a claim against the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.021" offset="3267002">In contrast to 106(a) and (b), section 106(c) contains nothing that is suggestive of monetary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.560" offset="3301170">It consists of two subparts, both of which must be satisfied for 106(c) to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.400" offset="3332517">Together they allow a court to make a determination of an issue arising under any of over 100 code provisions that contain one of three trigger words that are specified in 106(c)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="813.659" offset="3393539">The plurality in Hoffman construed the language of 106(c) as indicative of declaratory relief rather than monetary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.865" offset="3434394">That is clear, in our view, not only on the face of the statute, section 106(c) itself, but also when 106(c) is contrasted with (a) and (b), whereas (a) and (b) refer broadly to claims, and clearly indicate that Congress was thinking of monetary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.345" offset="3512344">106(c) refers to the courts making determinations of an issue, which is much narrower language than the language of claim used in 106(a) and (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1194.957" offset="4918776">Yes, to refer to the legislative history, it indicates that 106(c) was added primarily to resolve a conflict among the circuits, and that conflict had to do with the availability of declaratory relief rather than monetary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.733" offset="4985859">The floor managers of the legislation referred to a case called Gwilliam which was out of the Ninth Circuit, and the Gwilliam case held that a bankruptcy court could determine whether a tax debt was dischargeable, whether or not the IRS had filed a claim against the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.964" offset="5058793">There was contrary precedent in the Fifth Circuit, and so 106(c) essentially codifies the holding in Gwilliam so that even when a governmental unit has not filed a claim against the estate and brought itself within (a) and (b), it is still subject to declarations by the court, the bankruptcy court, that have to do with the Government's rights in the property of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.579" offset="5157222">So to the extent that Gwilliam is codified, Congress... the legislative history suggests... also intended to allow binding determinations on matters in addition to tax debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.522" offset="5213019">Thus, under the rationale of the way that section 106(c) operates is that the Government is bound by discharges in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.695" offset="5249695">If you look through the code, all of the discharge provisions in the various chapters contain a trigger word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.615" offset="5277385">And to the extent that a Government debt has been brought into the estate and is part of a reorganization plan or an order of relief or whatever, that is discharged, and the Government is bound by that discharge order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.941" offset="5330675">Thus, section 106(c), even though it does not authorize monetary relief, nonetheless serves a very important function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.880" offset="5366515">It gives the court a broad array of declaratory types of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.766" offset="5386055">And it also, in certain circumstances, allows incidental injunctive relief of the sort that was upheld in Whiting Pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.390" offset="5428477">I mentioned Whiting Pools a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.842" offset="5442270">To discuss it a little further, it involved tangible property that had been seized prior to bankruptcy filing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.709" offset="5749784">And it may well be that it is a product of haste or that in fact there are a fairly lengthy list of provisions that include one of these three trigger words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.983" offset="5790848">I think there are something like 111 in the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.768" offset="5805999">When you look at what provisions are triggered, there doesn't seem to be any rigorous logic between what was included and what was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.291" offset="5840063">And again, I would suggest that there was... to the extent that it was logical, there was a broader kind of logic going on that Congress started with the Gwilliam case that concerned declaratory relief in the tax area, and thought it would be a good idea to generalize that holding so that declaratory relief was available in other areas where the Government had not filed a claim against the estate, and thereby brought itself under (a) and (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.374" offset="5948419">You had this conflict in the circuits out there that it wanted to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.310" offset="5964197">And while it was at it, it considered what sorts of kind of major actors in the code would cover declaratory relief of the sort that it had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.420" offset="6016651">I think the only other thing that one can say about what the choice of the trigger words was is that the selection of governmental unit as a trigger word is significant in as much as it suggests that where Congress used the term governmental unit elsewhere in the code, it wasn't thinking about waiving sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.532" offset="6097108">It had to go back after the fact and add it as a trigger word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.935" offset="6114662">That is important inasmuch as, you know, likewise in the trigger provisions that address monetary recovery, there too, Congress was not thinking about sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.974" offset="6154891">And that is another reason why it is inappropriate to look to the trigger provisions to determine what kind of relief is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.765" offset="6193970">The third of the three trigger words, entity, I would suggest brings in some very important provisions that Congress would rationally have wanted to subject the Government to, such as the substance of the automatic stay provision, as well as a code provision which authorized the trustee to void the fixing of certain statutory liens that attach after a bankruptcy petition has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.249" offset="6303893">That provision only contains the trigger word entity and I think it is a situation where Congress chose entity with the idea of having particular provisions apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.390" offset="6352481">In any event, it is hard to figure out the logic of the way section 106(c) is drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.961" offset="6378812">What you can say about it with confidence is that it does not clearly speak to the issue of monetary recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.250" offset="6407965">And inasmuch as it is a waiver of sovereign immunity, Congress had to speak clearly, as it did in (a) and (b), if it intended to subject governmental entities to monetary relief under that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.243" offset="6463867">Because it is not clear, it cannot be construed in the manner that the Sixth Circuit adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2295.324" offset="9320200">If the Court will indulge me, I have been a bankruptcy practitioner for 31 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.811" offset="9342143">I have lived through the trauma of the 10 years of legislation that started with the Ford Foundation grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.148" offset="9371504">So if on occasion I slip off into what I know, please just check me and say, hey, you're off base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.939" offset="9410688">106(c) was created in part to cure different arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.109" offset="9439423">If we go back, the Bankruptcy Commission, whose report was beginning of the serious legislation that gave rise to the 1978 Bankruptcy Code, perceived a bankruptcy law where the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court would be all-encompassing, or as we called it, pervasive... any matters arising in, arising out of, et cetera, which this Court found constitutionally infirm in Marathon as an improper grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.545" offset="9557078">There was also tied with that a concept of being able to void multiple different pieces of litigation in nonbankruptcy forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.686" offset="9605666">When you come back to reading section 106(c)(1), if you start in a vacuum, which is a peculiar way to interpret a statute, but will help if you indulge me in my explaining what I believe is meant... if you read a provision in this title that contains creditor entity or governmental unit... applies to governmental units, which is 106(c)(1), read in a vacuum, unless intended to mean that any provision that says creditor or entity includes governmental unit, 106(c)(1) has no meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.830" offset="9774313">If you are going to read all of the words of the statute, then it must anywhere the word creditor or entity appears it is intended to include the governmental unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.305" offset="9820184">If you will go on to 106(c)(2), if you come to the conclusion that a determination means any judgment or decision on any issue binds a governmental unit, then you can take 106(c) and you can say that anywhere creditor, entity, or governmental unit appears, a decision of the bankruptcy court would bind the governmental unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.096" offset="9967305">When we get back to Hoffman, this Court is troubled by... if 106(c) says what I'm suggesting it was intended to mean, what is the role of 106(a) and 106(b)?</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.440" offset="10032716">The answer lies partly in the fact that when you read 106(a) you find the word claim appearing twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.799" offset="10082139">A governmental unit is deemed to have waived sovereign immunity with respect to any claim against such governmental unit... that was the first claim word... that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence out of which such governmental units claim arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.161" offset="10159566">The word claim is used in 106(a) as two different concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.100" offset="10191331">You have a proof... you have the definition of claim in the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.003" offset="10214946">Section 101.5 defines claim as a right to payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.507" offset="10240964">You also have the writing, called a proof of claim, which is dealt with in Bankruptcy Code section 501, and in rules 3001(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.750" offset="10297911">And I should add as a side comment, the filing of a proof of claim needs to be perceived as equivalent to the filing of a short form of complaint for money only in a nonbankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.927" offset="10358619">Now we deal with what 106(a) means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.228" offset="10375860">If the Government files this proof of claim, the piece of paper, because that's where their claim arose, in the bankruptcy court they have agreed to be subjected to any counterclaim or cross claim that arose out of the same transaction... the typical compulsory counterclaim provision of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.113" offset="10479410">So that if the Government files a proof of claim arising out of a defense contract that has nothing to do with the word creditor, entity, governmental unit... it has filed a proof of claim because the debtor hasn't finished performing on a defense contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.911" offset="10574600">The debtor says, but I have done more work than you have paid for, Mr. Government, you owe me money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.000" offset="10602917">That would be the 106(a) counterclaim arising out of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.654" offset="10629562">Interesting, if we read 106(a) and don't recognize that the word claim is being used in two different senses, we come to the conclusion that maybe the Government doesn't have to file a proof of claim for a 106(a) waiver of sovereign immunity, which is contrary to every case I've read... which is why I focus on the dual meaning of claim in 106(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.186" offset="10723707">There is a third meaning of claim that we need to keep sight of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.638" offset="10741470">And that is a claim is a cause of action, as we learned when I was in law school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.642" offset="10765503">So each time we see the word claim in 106, we have to think in terms of which meaning is it being used as.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.065" offset="10799253">When you get to 106(b), the offset provision, you have again the word claim appearing twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.706" offset="10841780">Now, one of the problems with the word... with the structure of 106(b) is it deals with an allowed claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.513" offset="10885039">There shall be offset against an allowed claim or interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.465" offset="10904788">Under the provisions of Chapters 9 and 11, and 106 is as significant and applicable in Chapters 9 and Chapter 11 as it is in Chapter 7... if the creditor is scheduled by the debtor for the correct amount and is not scheduled as being disputed, unliquidated, then in that event under bankruptcy rule 3003(b)(1), and section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, that creditor's claim is deemed filed, and if not objected to, will be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.577" offset="11085242">If we now look at 106(b), if that creditor has a deemed allowed, deemed filed claim in a Chapter 9 or 11, and it would be more frequently an 11 than a 9... there are very few 9's... and if we did not have 106(b), and if we look at 502(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, a creditor who received a preference, or voidable transfer who does not restore it, their claim shall be disallowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.369" offset="11232468">So if the bankruptcy court determined that a governmental agency or unit got a preference, the total claim could be disallowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.725" offset="11269875">If the preference were 5 dollars, and the governmental unit's proof of claim were 50 million dollars, the failure to return the 5 dollars would be a basis of disallowance of the 50 dollar million claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2896.148" offset="11723570">Where the governmental unit has a proof of claim, whether filed or deemed filed, and there is a settle off or disallowance, that 106(b) will override 502(d), and therefore the Government will only have a settle off and not a total disallowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.042" offset="11795145">Taken collectively, it means (c) was the intent... which goes right back to where we were with the Bankruptcy Commission... of the broad waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.731" offset="11833911">Additionally, since it is the Federal Government whom we are claiming has waived sovereign immunity, and Congress has passed the Bankruptcy Code, that waiver does not have to meet the Atascadero standard.</text>
