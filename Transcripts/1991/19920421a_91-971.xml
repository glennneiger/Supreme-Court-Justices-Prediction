            <text syncTime="2771.868" offset="11238215">That's why Two Pesos, when it took it, wrote into its franchise agreement that this trade dress, its look-alike trade dress was a distinctive and identifying trade dress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.723" offset="11325673">Protection of a trade dress or a trademark of any brand identifier serves two important functions: it protects consumers' ability to distinguish goods so that they can select the ones they like and the ones they don't like; and because it protects consumers' ability to distinguish goods, it protects businesses' ability to identify themselves to the public and to maintain, control, and build their own reputations based on their own quality without consumers being confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.042" offset="11434970">By protecting brand identifiers, you therefore serve the goal of competition on the merits among clearly distinguished brands.</text>

            <text syncTime="2876.778" offset="11657846">I mean, it kind of picked up the common law, and the common law has developed since.</text>

            <text syncTime="2897.391" offset="11740289">I think... let me try to answer that this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.114" offset="11755231">The common law categories in 1946 were sufficiently vague and amorphous that we would have had an argument that on these facts, the common law should say that inherent distinctiveness was enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.344" offset="11820119">That is simply because the common law recognized two somewhat distinct causes of action... a so-called technical trademark cause of action, and the broader, kind of residual, unfair competition cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.915" offset="11874454">As it happens, the technical trademark cause of action was more or less defined by the presence of inherent distinctiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.678" offset="11905487">It hadn't come to be applied to something that we're calling a trade dress here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.851" offset="11926176">But we would have had an argument that it could have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.961" offset="11934640">And what the Fifth Circuit said in the Chevron case was there's no reason why we shouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.395" offset="11956374">Anything including what we call a trade dress that serves to identify the brand, rather than to describe the product, serves the same functions and should be protected on the same standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.613" offset="12005170">Now secondary meaning, in the end, has nothing to do with what we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.840" offset="12042160">The harm to consumers' ability to choose between competing brands is present one by one as consumers come to be aware of Taco Cabana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.090" offset="12103077">The harm to Taco Cabana's ability to identify itself to consumers, and to control its reputation, unimpaired by confusion, as a result of Two Pesos was there from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.337" offset="12148112">And if, from a systemic point of view, you had a rule that said secondary meaning, market-wide, widespread recognition was required, what you would have is a perilous situation for any new product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.668" offset="12209448">By definition, a new product cannot have market-wide recognition immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.781" offset="12225853">If, in the interim, a competitor could... like Two Pesos... could come along and simply take the trade dress, the goodwill that the new company was trying to build up, customer by customer, would be immediately threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.190" offset="12283531">And what you would have is a serious inhibition on the creation of new brand identifiers, possibly an inhibition on the creation of new business, and certainly a depravation of the informational benefits to consumers that having more clearly distinguished brand identifiers provide to consumers.</text>
