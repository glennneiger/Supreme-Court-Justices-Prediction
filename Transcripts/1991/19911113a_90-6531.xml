            <label>Mr. Alvin J. Bronstein</label>
            <text syncTime="78.703" offset="455328">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="88.310" offset="493781">I represent, by appointment of this Court, the petitioner, Keith Hudson, a prisoner at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.383" offset="534114">On the night of October 30, 1983, Mr. Hudson had an exchange of words with one of the respondents, Sergeant McMillian.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.740" offset="567550">The officer decided to give Hudson a disciplinary charge, two charges I believe, and to comport with the policy, McMillian then called another officer, the respondent Sergeant Woods and again, by virtue of policy, called their ranking superior, Lieutenant Mezo.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.825" offset="643828">The officers placed Hudson in full restraints before moving in to a disciplinary cell which is referred to in the record as the dungeon.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.275" offset="681653">Full restraints consisted of handcuffs, attached to waist chains and shackles or leg irons.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.178" offset="713314">In other words, Hudson was essentially immobilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.458" offset="726375">The two sergeants then led Hudson out of his cell, down a corridor and out of sight of any other prisoners in their cells.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.784" offset="755736">They stopped, and at that point the two sergeants, both of whom were over 6 feet tall and each weighing 200 or more pounds, began to beat the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.420" offset="794189">Sergeant Woods held him from behind and hit him in the back.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.527" offset="810698">McMillian repeatedly punched Hudson about the face, mouth, and chest.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.400" offset="830133">Lieutenant Mezo stood by and observing the beating and saying only, quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="177.946" offset="852389">"Don't be having too much fun, boys. "</text>
            <text syncTime="180.507" offset="862629">Hudson sustained some injuries, bruises and swelling to his face, mouth and lip; a split lower lip; and a cracked dental plate, a few bruises on his body.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.174" offset="909232">After the beating ended he was taken and thrown into the disciplinary cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.672" offset="931279">He brought a pro se action under the civil rights act, and the case proceeded to a full trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.559" offset="954789">The trial court, after reviewing the testimony of various witnesses and certain exhibits, they heard from a number of prisoners, a number of officers, found essentially the facts that I have just recited.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.304" offset="1001810">The trial court went on to find that there was no need to use any force because the petitioner was already in restraints, that the force used was excessive, and that the respondents' conduct was, quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="229.096" offset="1056981">"can only be seen as motivated by malice. "</text>
            <text syncTime="233.079" offset="1072863">The court found that Hudson's Eight Amendment rights were violated and awarded him $800 in compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.200" offset="1101389">The court of appeals did not disturb any of the findings... the trial court's factual findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.057" offset="1124794">Indeed, it repeated them and deplored the use of unnecessary force in the treatment of prisoners, calling it a blight on the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.413" offset="1162202">The Fifth Circuit stated that because no force was required in this case, the force used was objectively unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.488" offset="1198460">The conduct of the respondents, the court said, and again I quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="269.252" offset="1217581">"qualified as clearly excessive and occasioned unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. "</text>
            <text syncTime="275.625" offset="1243077">End quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.764" offset="1247570">However, the court of appeals went on to reverse the judgment of the trial court because it found that Hudson did not suffer a significant injury, one prong of a four-element standard for Eighth Amendment violations, constructed by the Fifth Circuit, without any reference to any decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.865" offset="1328027">The court of appeals refers only to a prior Eighth Amendment decision in its court in the Fifth Circuit which in turn relies solely on a Fourth Amendment case in the circuit that misreads this Court's decision in Graham v. Connor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.081" offset="6664843">The question was, did the Fifth Circuit apply the correct legal test when determining the petitioner's claim that his Eighth Amendment rights under the cruel and unusual punishment clause were not violated as a result of a single incident of force by the respondents, which did not cause a significant injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.869" offset="6748017">As counsel has pointed out to you, Justice O'Connor and gentlemen... the Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.645" offset="6803083">I thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.348" offset="6809980">The Fifth Circuit has a four-element test, and I think the only one with which we are concerned with today is the first element, namely that is, that there must be a significant injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.717" offset="6867449">Now, what my friends appear to have done is that they seem to be overlooking that or merging it, insofar as the decisions of this honorable Court are concerned, with the fourth element... that is, the nature of the unnecessary and wanton suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.333" offset="6945921">Let me say this, it will be recalled that in Estelle v. Gamble, the decision was that the indifference which was at issue must be to serious medical claims, not just any medical claims... serious medical claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.389" offset="7026065">In Rhodes it was held that double-celling was not sufficiently serious to satisfy the objective component of the Eighth Amendment prison claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.118" offset="7072981">And perhaps it's appropriate at this point for me to recall that in Wilson against Seiter, it was made clear by this Court that an Eight Amendment violation claim requires both an objective and a subjective element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.501" offset="7142571">And in Rhodes, the question which was decided was that the objective element was not sufficiently serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.733" offset="7179456">Here we're concerned with the objective element again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.684" offset="7199309">Now, Wilson, I think is the one which makes it clearest of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.962" offset="7224386">In Wilson, Your Honors cited your decision in Whitley with a proposition, and I quote:</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.378" offset="7278094">Clearly what was said there was harmful enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.720" offset="7291469">It excluded conduct which was less than harmful enough, whether you use the term "harmful", whether you use the term "significant", whether you use the term "insignificant", clearly what was stated there was that there was a level, if you will, below which you didn't have a constitutional violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2065.951" offset="8404389">I think that the entire basis for that statement was, as I say, the off-hand remark that the other prisoner was also beaten, as to which we have no evidence and nothing but the passing remark by the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.431" offset="8458306">But let me come back, if I may, to your original question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.585" offset="8474920">Is there any objection to the administration of some sort of treatment or some... something that gives a great deal of pain but doesn't leave a trace?</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.879" offset="8520060">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.409" offset="8522149">Because what we say is that you have a different standard, if you will, where the violation consists of a physical beating, which would normally leave traces, or one which was calculated not to leave traces, because we all know, to the shame of our system, that there are methods of torturing or punishing people that leave no traces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.038" offset="8628729">As to those, if the testimony is that there was intense suffering, say, but that the nature of the procedure was such that it left no marks, then we do not urge this test of a... an observable significant injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.828" offset="8707828">What we're saying is, and we would respectfully enjoin the Court to bear this in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.779" offset="8735622">We are saying that where there is a physical invasion, if you will, a physical maltreatment of a prisoner which would normally be expected to leave some sort of traces, that then there must have been a significant injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.833" offset="8807929">Now, that doesn't exclude a significant injury that doesn't leave traces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.566" offset="8830812">For example, in your Estelle case, there was no physical trace, but what they said was that studied indifference to serious medical needs could lead to a condition which would be sufficiently detrimental, if you will, sufficiently harmful to the prisoner to warrant invoking the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.945" offset="8944288">By the same token, in the conditions of confinement, there was no evidence of any physical deterioration on the part of the prisoners, but the test there is not the marks, if you will--</text>

            <text syncTime="2332.284" offset="9469663">And the reason for that was that the injuries were so slight.</text>

            <text syncTime="3138.021" offset="12692651">But I think that the answer to the question is, I say there are two separate questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.689" offset="12723266">One is, did this episode rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation by reason of the significance of the injury?</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.278" offset="12761614">Now, while to you or to me or to anyone in our situation in life, even a slight beating would constitute a significant injury, the fact is that in context, this was not a significant injury and the standard which this Court has enunciated in those cases, and in particular in Wilson against Seiter, is that you must suffer objectively significant harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.423" offset="12882195">This, I take from page 279 and 280 of the Wilson v. Seiter lawyer's edition opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.874" offset="12908004">Again, at page 282, Whitley was cited for the proposition that, assuming that the conduct is harmful enough to satisfy the objective component of an Eight Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.917" offset="12960249">And at page 279, Rhodes is cited for the proposition that the objective component of the Eighth Amendment prison claim was, and I quote: "Was the deprivation sufficiently serious"?</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.346" offset="13029944">So that what we would respectfully suggest to Your Honors is that the test applied by the Fifth Circuit, that is to say, the first element, is the objective element, was there a significant injury, is a proper one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.230" offset="13097444">It is one which is in keeping with the holdings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.166" offset="13117193">It is a practical one which commends itself as a means of eliminating frivolous claims, and that, therefore, we would strongly recommend to Your Honors that the Fifth Circuit should be affirmed and the judgment accordingly.</text>
