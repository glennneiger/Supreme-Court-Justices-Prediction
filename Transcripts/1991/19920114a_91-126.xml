            <text syncTime="93.276" offset="516631">As it turns out they have an order from the judge that says take 23 head of cattle and other personal property, and they take possession of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.032" offset="547664">Now, Your Honor, these cattle are Brahma cattle, which probably means not much to most members of this Court, but it's a peculiar type of cow, and that is that a Brahma, if Your Honors have ever watched a rodeo, once these cattle have ever been driven with horses or ever been chased with dogs they become mean and unmanageable.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.367" offset="1085055">The Mississippi statute provided or allowed... it could be interpreted to provide... the Mississippi supreme court later ruled this is an incorrect interpretation, but it could be read to say that you can go seize somebody's property and then have the hearing later.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.461" offset="1145346">You just file your affidavit with the judge that you're entitled to the property, he automatically issues the order to go pick up the property, and then you have the hearing later after posting a bond, so you can be sued, of course, if you were wrong in making the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.471" offset="1209398">So that's basically the statutory scheme, and that's the way that they were able to come take the cattle, and after having them a few days Mr. Cole transported them to Texas, even though a State judge ruled that the order of replevin was wrong in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.589" offset="1865907">Of course, everybody knows the judge was immune, and of course we didn't sue the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.374" offset="1881058">Everybody knows that he was immune from making a judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.078" offset="1891821">There are compelling reasons why the law officers were immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.196" offset="1904360">The judge told them to go out there and seize the cattle, and they couldn't be put in the position very well of violating the court's order of being held in contempt, but in addition to that we had the qualified immunity, which we think is very tough to overcome, but those immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.921" offset="1959217">So we just... even though the statute says, here you are, you're got a remedy, under the immunity doctrines as they developed we didn't have any remedy because... and the reason we're here today, and the only person that was involved that was not subject to decisions of this Court, and we don't believe the decisions of this Court have been followed in this case, was Cole and his attorney, Robbins.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.017" offset="2039569">That is the private party immunity, immunity of private parties who violate constitutional rights, and that's the question that's before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.707" offset="2078335">Justice O'Connor in Forrester v. White sounded a familiar theme for this Court, a theme that is said over and over again in these immunity cases, when Your Honor said we don't extend immunity beyond what its policy considerations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.234" offset="2148448">In applying immunity, we look to the policies that the immunity was created for.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.852" offset="2166942">That was said directly in Forrester v. White and is a theme, I think, in this Court's qualified immunity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.590" offset="2193901">Now, Your Honor, the policies that this Court has announced in qualified immunity cases are very clear and are just about the opposite of any policies that might be involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.782" offset="2246668">For example, this Court has said and said over and again probably beginning with Harlow v. Fitzgerald, but over and over again, we want to attract citizens to public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.121" offset="2288046">We don't want to make it undesirable for a citizen... unnecessarily desirable for a citizen to hold public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.025" offset="2311661">We're not involved in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.244" offset="2320542">Mr. Robbins and Mr. Cole are not candidates for public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.529" offset="2341649">They're just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.398" offset="2345098">They're private people.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.231" offset="2348441">And then, Your Honors, probably the strongest case for immunity is the law enforcement officer, the fellow that's out there and he's trying to decide whether to make an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.670" offset="2382191">If he makes the arrest, this Court has said we don't want to hold him liable for exercising his judgment and trying to save society from some criminal act in making the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.943" offset="2423360">We don't want to put a burden on that discretionary decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.827" offset="2434854">We want him to be able to make that decision on whether somebody committed a crime and whether they ought to be arrested based on exercising his discretion in carrying out a public function.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.833" offset="2470903">Of course, that's not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.285" offset="2480725">That has nothing to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.154" offset="2488144">And then, Your Honor, probably the strongest thing, or the thing that's so applicable to public officials and so inapplicable to a private party, when you look at Mitchell v. Forsyth this Court made it very clear that it's not just an immunity from damages, it's an immunity from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.414" offset="2557212">The official is not supposed to take his mind off of his important public duties, take his time away from them, by having to defend the suit, and so not only it is a freedom from damages, but it's a freedom from suit so he can take an immediate appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.173" offset="2620219">Now, to put these people in that position and say we don't want to take their minds off of public duties and they can take an immediate appeal is just totally inconsistent with the policies of Mitchell v. Forsyth.</text>

            <text syncTime="647.174" offset="2732232">There was also a private immunity in 1870, though, for people bringing legal actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.594" offset="2765878">I mean, you couldn't sue and recover for false arrest, for malicious prosecution, for abuse of process, without showing that the person brought that legal process without probable cause, which meant that the person had to have entertained a subjective belief that he was not justified in going ahead.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.015" offset="5083566">Qualified immunity is out, and I don't know that it's appropriate for this Court to announce exactly what defenses maybe Cole could raise down in the courts, but if the Court is going to do that, I would just suggest that those analogous defenses that exist in the common law, Mr. Cole ought to be able to get up there and say, I think, well I thought the statute was legal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.681" offset="8138325">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed everything which came to it from the district court except that it remanded for a finding of attorney's fees against Mr. Cole for the reason that he had engaged in conduct which violated the statute after the district court judge had declared it unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.546" offset="8233724">The jury had found no damages at the trial below because for the main reason that counsel for Mr. Wyatt conceded that there were no damages occurring even for the mental anguish which he alleges his client to have suffered, that no damages occurred after the declaration of unconstitutionality, that all of the damages which Mr. Wyatt was claiming he said occurred before the declaration of unconstitutionality, and Mr. Waide has alluded to the great emotion and upset that he experienced because of the taking of his cattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.337" offset="8388892">Now, a second public policy reason to consider is that if the Court does not grant immunity to private persons who acted as Mr. Cole and Mr. Robbins did, then the Court would be putting the burden of paying for the unconstitutionality of the Mississippi statute on the persons who absolutely have the minimal involvement in this case, and in this Court's decision last term in Burns v. Reed, in discussing the extension of... well, actually the issue was, of course, whether the prosecutor would be entitled to absolute immunity in his role of giving the advice to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.796" offset="8550746">In his majority opinion at... I've got 114 Lawyer's Edition 2nd 564... there is a discussion by the majority there as to why should we extend this grant of absolute immunity to the prosecutor in his role of advising the police and then grant only the limited or qualified immunity to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.678" offset="8646250">So this Court has previously looked at who has the most involvement, who has the most ability to determine the unconstitutionality of the statute, and one of the comments that the Court makes there is that those police officers are certainly not going to have the law training that prosecutors have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2446.219" offset="9928444">In 1975, the Mississippi legislature revised an earlier edition of the replevin statute because the first edition which I'm familiar with did not have the requirement of bond, did not have the availability for advancing the course on the docket, and so I would say that a reasonable attorney even with more expertise in the area than Mr. Robbins had would not come to the conclusion that this statute was unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.813" offset="11454831">No, Your Honor, I was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.347" offset="11456921">What the petitioner wants to do in this case is to deny the extension of immunity, and when this Court has denied the extension of immunity it has relied in part on policy grounds and part on the historical inquiry which I'll get to in a second, but for instance, in Owen v. City of Independence, the court there at the end of the opinion makes the comment basically that it is as a matter of policy equating the role... has done equity in that it would provide a plaintiff with a remedy, it would allow the official who acts in good faith to go about his duties without fear of being dragged into court, and it makes the public pay only for those unconstitutional policies which the State enforces, and so therefore it spreads the liability for the unconstitutionality of a statute among the citizens of the State, and that would not be done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.041" offset="11719713">It would be quite the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.391" offset="11725146">It would be placed upon the private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.576" offset="11733819">As far as the historical analysis is concerned, this Court has looked at historical analyses most strongly when it was denying... or when it was granting full immunity as in the case of legislatures, prosecutors, and judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.205" offset="11804350">In the later inquiries there is not... such as in Anderson v. Creighton, there has not been the great reliance upon historical precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.226" offset="11844474">When a police officer at common law did not have reasonable grounds to act in effectuating an arrest or carrying out a search, then he had a defense which was based upon a subjective standard, and this Court in Anderson v. Creighton adopted the Harlow v. Fitzgerald standard and said we will make it an objective reasonableness standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.676" offset="11942276">There's no reason, logically, then, why that same standard cannot translate to be utilized by the private defendant, and one of the things that I think that Wyatt overlooks is that the good faith... or excuse me, the objective reasonableness standard which is applied as an immunity in these cases is, after all, an affirmative defense, and so the party asserting that affirmative defense has to come forward and on a motion for summary judgment bears the burden of showing that he would come under terms of the immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.836" offset="12098906">Your Honor, in this particular case Mr. Wyatt... or excuse me, Mr. Cole and Mr. Robbins utilized a statute which neither of them had reason to believe was unconstitutional, and they were attempting to go about utilizing an orderly process, although it turned out to be the wrong process, and the court's reasoning below in the Fifth Circuit for the granting of extension of immunity should be adopted here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph L. McNamara</label>
            <text syncTime="3053.528" offset="12357623">No, Your Honor, because the Mississippi replevin statute says... or provides for a person to be able to come in and challenge the taking of the property, and I believe it gives it a hearing within 3 days to seek to set aside the writ of replevin, and it would seem at least under what this Court said in the Mitchell case that there were sufficient constitutional safeguards, but the important issue perhaps for the purposes of this case is in judging the conduct of the defendants under the objective reasonable standard, that the trial court said that objectively it could be determined that the statute was not one which was clearly unconstitutional at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.711" offset="12566394">Your Honor, the extension of qualified immunity in this situation would be uniform, it would be in keeping with the prior decisions of this Court, it would be a just resolution for private party defendants who until Lugar v. Edmondson were... those were among a class of persons who by most lawyers were not even dreamed to be potential section 1983 defendants, and the holdings in the Adickes v. S.H. Kress Company, and in other cases where a private party acts in conspiracy with a judge or public official, those holdings would be held intact, and furthermore, to use the example of Adickes v. Kress case, even if the court decided to grant qualified immunity in a situation such as that, those parties would not meet the objective reasonableness standard because there was a clear violation of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.294" offset="12872758">As is said in... I believe in the dissent in Lugar v. Edmondson makes a comment about Adickes v. Kress having occurred some 10 years after Brown v. Board of Education, and for the public policy reasons and because there's adequate historical basis for an analogy to give a good faith defense, and because this Court has adopted across the board Harlow v. Fitzgerald and other qualified immunity cases, we ask that this Court affirm the holding of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
