            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="145603">We'll hear argument now in No. 90-1262, Arkansas v. Oklahoma, No. 90-1266, Environmental Protection Agency v. Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.821" offset="200878">Mr. Wallace:</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="42.990" stopTime="298.288">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="42.990" offset="317489">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="47.634" offset="336088">This case involves judicial review of the validity of an action taken by a Federal agency pursuant to a Federal statute, namely the issuance of a permit by EPA for a new sewage treatment plant in Fayetteville, Arkansas, issuance of a permit under the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.428" offset="427307">And under that Federal statute, the permitting authority is to assure compliance with applicable water quality requirements, and this includes compliance with the EPA-approved water quality standards of a downstream State.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.492" offset="503481">The key to this case in our view lies in appreciating the fundamental importance under the Federal statute of a rather elusive distinction, but one that is not formalistic, for reasons I will try to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.613" offset="579967">And that is the distinction between the law of the downstream State, and the federally approved water quality standards adopted by that State, but that apply in the permitting process as a matter of Federal law under the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.598" offset="659902">The foundation on which we are building this distinction really is reflected in two of the holdings of this Court the last time it considered this general subject in International Paper Company against Oullette.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.519" offset="735657">One of those holdings was that the downstream State's law is not preempted by the Clean Water Act insofar as it applies to sources in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.721" offset="800441">No State law is preempted as it applies within the State to sources in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.825" offset="828862">No Federal approval of such State law is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.658" offset="844222">It takes effect if it's enacted by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.639" offset="856134">The other foundation holding in International Paper against Oullette is that the Clean Water Act does preempt application of a State's law to discharges in another State.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.050" offset="925724">So it's only if the out of State, the affected State, the downstream State's standards are approved by EPA, that they are to be applied in the permitting process in the source State.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.434" offset="1007330">And what is significant in the Federal act, and not emphasized in our brief as much as I think its significance would warrant, is that the Federal act in its implementing regulation require that certain processes be followed in the adoption or review of State standards if they are to qualify for EPA approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.720" offset="1112447">And the most relevant process that's required is requirements for public hearings and public participation, at which affected persons and States would have an opportunity to be heard about the impact of water quality standards on their operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.457" offset="1207428">And EPA itself is a very active participant in the development of these water quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.591" offset="1235954">It provides technical guidance through participation in these hearings, consultation, model regulations, et cetera, and moreover, a renewed opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.671" offset="1300215">In fact, the statute requires hearings every... to be conducted every 3 years to get public participation about needed revisions.</text>
