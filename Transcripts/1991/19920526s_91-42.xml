            <text syncTime="5.833" offset="114142">The first one is No. 91-42, United States against Burke.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.392" offset="136399">In this case, it was a settlement of a sex discrimination case under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.353" offset="172239">And under that settlement, the Tennessee Valley Authority paid backpay to affected employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.779" offset="197943">It withheld federal income taxes from that backpay.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.855" offset="214243">The IRS disallowed the respondent's claim for refund of the taxes so withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.364" offset="240261">In a refund action, the District Court ruled that the settlement proceeds could not be excluded from gross income as, to use the words of the statute, damages received on account of personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.432" offset="296477">The Sixth Circuit, however, reversed and it held that the discrimination was a personal and tort-like injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.165" offset="335452">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.247" offset="351752">We hold that these backpay awards in settlement of Title VII claims are not excludable from gross income under Section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.952" offset="398563">Justice Scalia and Justice Souter each have filed opinions concurring in the judgment, and Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
