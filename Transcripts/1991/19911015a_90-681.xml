            <text syncTime="53.301" offset="338101">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="59.205" offset="361716">We are before the Court on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit following its reversal of the entry of final judgment in favor of our client, the petitioner, Barbara Hafer, by the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.916" offset="436531">Although other claims were considered by the courts below against the Auditor General and her co-defendant, James West, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, no aspect of those claims is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.545" offset="503091">The only issue before this Court relates to the claims against the petitioner arising out of Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which is Title 42, United States Code, Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.304" offset="570069">The principal question before the Court involves the application of the Court's 1989 holding in Will v. Michigan Department of State Police, wherein the Court held neither the State nor its officials acting in an official capacity are persons under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.122" offset="669334">The petitioner, the Auditor General, is an elected official of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.708" offset="699740">The primary function of the petitioner is to ensure that all the revenues due to the Commonwealth are collected and all the funds so collected are legally and properly disbursed.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.266" offset="750000">To fulfill that sensitive responsibility the Auditor General supervises a staff of approximately 800 employees consisting of auditors, investigators, and revenue agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.509" offset="806947">The Auditor General is vested with the ultimate statutory authority to hire and fire the employees within that department.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.334" offset="854176">The Auditor General took office and was inaugurated January 17, 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.506" offset="886882">Shortly thereafter, she fired the 16 respondents, 8 because they were ineffective managers and the other 8 because they were beneficiaries of a job-buying scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.349" offset="942261">Each of the 16 are seeking money damages personally against the Auditor General--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="213.455" offset="978728">May I ask you a question right now?</text>
            <text syncTime="215.055" offset="985102">Would the issue that you're going to argue be any different if the 16 plaintiffs had been fired because they were all females?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jerome_r_richter" startTime="221.792" stopTime="384.044">
            <label>Mr. Jerome R. Richter</label>
            <text syncTime="221.792" offset="1012060">--The issue would be no different.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.879" offset="1036406">It would affect, of course, perhaps the fact that there's alternative relief available under Title VII, but it wouldn't affect the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.567" offset="1075172">The relevance, of course, Justice Stevens, to our making reference to the facts relating to the job-buying scheme in which eight of the respondents were the beneficiaries has to do with the concern about the interference by the courts into the internal operations of State Government, particularly in a case of such a sensitive and public nature as that involved in the job-buying scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.942" offset="1232638">But to go on, seven... seven of the respondents as union members pursued and secured arbitration awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.016" offset="1284988">They... they were union members, and as such they were entitled to a grievance procedure which permitted the arbitration process, and each of the seven was awarded reinstatement with back pay and interest on the back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.259" offset="1345905">The reason for the arbitration awards, was given by the arbitrators, was that they grounded their awards solely on the basis that there was a total lack of... lack of adequate proof on the part of the Auditor General that the seven respondents knew that their jobs were purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.541" offset="1435035">All eight beneficiaries of the job-buying scheme, including the seven with the awards for reinstatement, are still pressing 1983 claims alleging political discharge in violation of the First Amendment and their due process rights against the Auditor General in her individual capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.471" offset="1522806">These eight have been consolidated, with James Melo as the lead plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.775" offset="1544018">The other eight, who were fired as ineffective managers, have had their cases consolidated with Carl Gurley as the lead plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.548" offset="1579126">Two of the Gurley respondents have sought money damages only from the Auditor General, while the other six are seeking money damages as well as reinstatement, and they are seeking reinstatement against the Auditor General in her official capacity... excuse me.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.862" offset="1764387">--And expressly so stated in that one complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.112" offset="1773373">In the other 10 complaints involving all of the other respondents, there was no identification of the capacity in which they were pursuing their claims against the Auditor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.002" offset="1812870">With respect to the claims for prospective relief, we readily concede that the Will decision affirms the doctrine of Ex parte Young, and that a State official is a person for purposes of injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.964" offset="1884759">And we do not challenge that aspect of the Circuit Court's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.331" offset="1898238">The Auditor General moved for summary judgment before the district court and relied on the Will decision, and set forth her function in summary judgment papers reflecting that she was acting in her official capacity, that she was the duly authorized State official who had the ability and authority to hire and fire in that office, and the district court concluded in entering judgment in favor of the Auditor General, that she was in fact acting in her official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.089" offset="2045255">She therefore was not a person under Section 1983, and dismissed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.242" offset="2065840">The district court did not address the merits of the political discharge claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.979" offset="2084857">The circuit court reversed, treated the summary judgment as if it had been a judgment on the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.268" offset="2129997">While not addressing the determination of the district court that the Auditor General was acting in her official capacity, the circuit court nevertheless held that respondents could maintain the actions against the Auditor General based simply on the fact that they had asserted that they were suing her in her personal capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.451" offset="2214738">And by that, the Circuit Court thus interpreted Will as standing for the proposition that State officials, sued for damages in their personal capacity, are persons under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.543" offset="2275029">We submit that that is not what this Court held at all in the Will decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.281" offset="2301987">On the contrary, at the outset of the Will decision, the Court stated that the case presented the question of whether a State or State official, while acting in his or her official capacity, is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, and then proceeded to answer that question at the conclusion in the negative, wherein the court stated, "We hold"... and I quote...</text>
            <text syncTime="571.181" offset="2409611">"that neither a State nor its officials acting in their official capacities are persons under Section 1983. "</text>
            <text syncTime="579.335" offset="2442212">We submit that the Circuit Court holding was inconsistent with this... the important holding in the Will decision, and if not reversed will eviscerate the meaning of the Will case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1261.527" offset="5170963">Our view is that the Will case tells us that she had to be acting outside her official capacity in order for her to be held individually responsible, because in our submission the Will case tells us she's acting in her official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.073" offset="5241180">She is not a person, and as such, can't be held responsible under 1983 personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.560" offset="5271169">I just wanted to make a few more points, and that is there was no case prior to the Will decision in this Court that dealt with a statutory definition of whether a State official is a person with respect to money damage claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.406" offset="5354552">All of the prior decisions that have been relied upon by the respondents deal with Eleventh Amendment or immunity issues, and this Court had specifically made it clear that the scope of the Eleventh Amendment and the scope of 1983 are separate issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.457" offset="5454758">In Will, for example, the plaintiff cited Kentucky v. Graham for the proposition that the court assumed the State was a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.598" offset="5503241">But the Will court in footnote 4 rejected that proposition and stated that this Court did not address the meaning of "person" in any of those cases, and none of the cases was resolution of that issue necessary to the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.441" offset="5566666">Accordingly, we submit that the reliance on Kentucky v. Graham by the respondents here as well as their reliance on the Rhoads... Scheuer v. Rhoads decision and the Forrester decision is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.416" offset="5614522">The respondents had argued and the circuit court had concluded that this Court would permit State officials to be sued and to be liable solely because they're named in their personal capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.662" offset="5695502">We believe that this Court intended what it meant when it said "acting", that the Court's repeated and deliberate use of the word "acting" in its holding was with a view to focusing on the function of the actions of the State official, and that the form of the pleading does not control the statutory definition of "person".</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.111" offset="5785363">If it please the Court, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_goldstein" startTime="1423.348" stopTime="1618.508">
            <label>Mr. William Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="1423.348" offset="5818278">Mr. Chief... Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.204" offset="5849729">This Court in prior decisions has used the expression "official capacity" in two different contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.560" offset="5883166">The first is to describe an attribute of the conduct of a 1983 defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.083" offset="5913259">Was that defendant acting in his official capacity, and if so he would be acting under color of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.819" offset="5944188">For example, in West v. Atkins Mr. Justice Blackmun stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.223" offset="5965817">"Generally a public employee acts under color of State law while acting in his official capacity or while exercising his responsibilities pursuant to State law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.714" offset="6015763">If a person is acting in his official capacity, he is certainly acting under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.268" offset="6037915">But official capacity has also been used by the Court to describe the legal personage of a defendant in a 1983 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.291" offset="6078039">That is, is the defendant being sued in an official or personal capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.612" offset="6099355">And legal personage is important because it determines where the real interests lie in the case, and if a money judgment is awarded, who will pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.419" offset="6138539">Justice O'Connor in Karcher v. May stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.721" offset="6155780">"The concept of legal personage is a practical means of identifying the real interest at stake in a lawsuit. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.560" offset="6187126">"We have repeatedly recognized that the real party in interest in an official capacity suit is the entity represented and not the individual office-holder. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.416" offset="6230594">and Justice O'Connor cited Kentucky v. Graham and Brandon v. Holt for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.237" offset="6253791">The expression "official capacity", then, can have two meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.140" offset="6269464">It can be describing the conduct of the defendant which occurred before the lawsuit took place and which gives rise to it, or it can describe the legal personage of the defendant once the litigation is under way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.031" offset="6320978">The petitioner seeks to equate the conduct with the legal personage, and to say that if the defendant was acting in an official capacity, he or she can only be sued in an official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.326" offset="6394225">And what that equation does was basically to abolish personal capacity lawsuits where the defendant is a State employee or a State official, because in an official capacity lawsuit it is the State that is the defendant, and we know that the State is not a person under 1983, and the State has Eleventh Amendment immunity in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.643" offset="6499446">So I do not believe that Will was ever intended to abolish personal capacity lawsuits, and I believe that Will spoke only in the context of what the Supreme Court of Michigan recognized to be an official capacity lawsuit and which this Court said in its opinion was an official capacity lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.592" offset="6591293">I would also say that--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="1618.508" offset="6598921">How do we know when it's a personal capacity suit, and how specific must the complaint be, do you think?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_goldstein" startTime="1627.095" stopTime="2084.891">
            <label>Mr. William Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="1627.095" offset="6633298">--In order to be an official capacity suit under Kentucky v. Graham it is necessary to allege that the governmental entity was the moving force behind the deprivation of civil rights and that the entity's policy and custom played a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.860" offset="6720338">Without those allegations, there can be no official capacity liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.514" offset="6742908">So I would say that one thing to look at in the lawsuit is whether the official capacity allegations are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.835" offset="6768194">Secondly, according to Kentucky v. Graham, if you're proceeding in an official capacity lawsuit, then you would give notice to the governmental entity and you would give them an opportunity to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.345" offset="6826291">In this case, the governmental entity was not notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.647" offset="6839456">Only Barbara Hafer is notified, only she is requested for damages, and only she was involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.216" offset="6869758">In addition, there have been decisions of this Court in Brandon v. Holt and I believe in the Bender case where the Court said that we can look to the subsequent conduct of proceedings if it is in doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.793" offset="6924093">And in this case we did file documents before the Court entered summary judgment in which we specifically said that we are proceeding only against Barbara Hafer in her personal capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.553" offset="6979055">And there is a verification in the records which appears at page 197 where it just actually states that, where it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.277" offset="7025971">"No claim for damages has ever been made against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.895" offset="7040495">"All claims for damages have been made against Barbara Hafer individually and in her individual capacity. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.799" offset="7064109">"Service of the complaint was made upon Barbara Hafer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.001" offset="7076857">"No service was attempted upon the Commonwealth agency or the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.239" offset="7097860">"No money has been sought, and no claim has been made for monetary damages to be paid out of the Commonwealth's Treasury. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.976" offset="7124818">I will admit that the initial pleadings are not paragons in this case, but I think that we did get the point across at a stage that was still reasonable and fair to the defendant to know what the issues were in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.235" offset="7181869">I would respectfully suggest to the Court that since 1974, with Scheuer v. Rhoads, it has been the law that if a State executive official personally commits a deprivation of civil rights, then that official can be held accountable and made in his person to respond to the victim to remedy the right that has been wronged... that has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.570" offset="7295136">And in that matter the Court actually cited Ex parte Young as authority for that position, and the Court... and Chief Justice Burger, speaking for a unanimous Court, said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.794" offset="7344038">"However, since Ex parte Young, it has been settled that the Eleventh Amendment provides no shield for a State official confronted by a claim that he has deprived another of a Federal right under color of State law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.851" offset="7392312">and further on, went really right down to the capacity issue and personal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.605" offset="7419270">It says that, Young teaches that when a State officer acts under a State law in a manner violative of the Federal Constitution, he comes into conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution, and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.455" offset="7510699">All that we are asking in this case is that Barbara Hafer be accountable for the consequences of her individual conduct, and I would respectfully submit that if petitioner were to prevail in this case it would be necessary to overrule Scheuer v. Rhoads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.964" offset="7576736">I would also call to the Court's attention what I believe to have been a unanimous decision in Forrester v. White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.836" offset="7608188">Forrester v. White was a State judge, a State official who fired a probation officer, and it was determined that that firing was a violation of the probation officer's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.330" offset="7666180">A personal capacity lawsuit was filed, and a verdict of about $ 80,000 was entered against the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.317" offset="7694183">The judge said that I am entitled to absolute immunity because I am a judicial officer, and this Court said that hiring and firing is not the type of conduct that will qualify for an absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.028" offset="7756981">Hiring, firing is administrative, and we can tell... or we think we know that back in 1871 what immunities were fairly in the minds of Congress and hiring and firing was not one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.586" offset="7811211">Well, what Hafer has done in this case is a hiring and firing decision, and she is a State official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.823" offset="7836184">She is really seeking an absolute immunity in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.477" offset="7850813">She's saying, I can't be personally responsible for my conduct, and if she were to receive an absolute immunity, I would think that this Court would have to overrule Forrester v. White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.201" offset="7897729">I would also say that her position simply is not supportable by the plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.522" offset="7930957">Mr. Richter conceded that Hafer was acting under color of State law at the time she fired these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.378" offset="7962408">The statute identifies the potential defendants in this case: all persons acting under color of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.417" offset="8002532">Hafer in her individual capacity is a person, and she is acting under color of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.054" offset="8025102">The statute then says that if those persons commit a violation of civil rights, they are liable for an action at law, and this Court has traditionally held that an action at law is an action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.980" offset="8080795">So under the plain meaning of the statute, if she is acting under color of State law and she commits a violation of someone's civil rights, at the very least she is liable for an action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.638" offset="8131473">There has been some reference in Petitioner's brief to a worry about vexatious lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.263" offset="8169925">I would respectfully submit that the concept, this doctrine of qualified immunity, developed to the final point in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, adequately handles that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.320" offset="8218199">And I would respectfully say to the Court from the decision of Mitchell v. Forsyth, where Justice White stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.926" offset="8252576">"We emphasize that the denial of absolute immunity will not leave the Attorney General at the mercy of litigants with frivolous and vexatious complaints. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.115" offset="8289357">"Under the standard of qualified immunity in Harlow, the Attorney General will be entitled to immunity so long as his actions do not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights which a reasonable person would have known. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.958" offset="8348707">Justice White concluded,</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.774" offset="8356021">"We do not believe that the security of the republic will be threatened if its Attorney General is given incentives to abide by clearly established law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.063" offset="8393115">To paraphrase that, I would respectfully submit that the security of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will not be threatened if its Auditor General is given incentives to abide by clearly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.359" offset="8454346">I think we will be better for it.</text>
