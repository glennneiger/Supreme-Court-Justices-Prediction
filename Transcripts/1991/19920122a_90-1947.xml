            <text syncTime="252.628" offset="1166886">And what do the pleadings tell us?</text>
            <text syncTime="254.399" offset="1173992">That an ordinance was passed, the tenants were given the right to occupy at a reduced rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.613" offset="1190919">They can sell that right for the first time to an incoming tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.796" offset="1207637">That they do sell it and that they receive a profit when they sell it by selling the coach for more than it's worth, and that premium value represents the value of the interest of property that are transferred under the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.723" offset="1259360">What is the city's defense to this claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="278.284" offset="1269600">Stripped of its sociology, it's basically this: that the tenants own a portable structure which they bring onto my client's land on wheels.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.261" offset="1305440">While it's parked on my client's land, they put it on jacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.074" offset="1320695">And when it gets old enough, or if it becomes obsolescence and the tenant decides to remove it, they put wheels under it again and they haul it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.620" offset="1354863">And the city says, under the circumstances, this is such a unique relationship that we are justified in creating thousands of estates in land in transferring the value to the tenants who own the portable structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.347" offset="1409825">And what are the justifications given for this... that is (1) it preserves low and moderate-income housing, and (2) it protects the investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.075" offset="1448695">We need to examine this claim from a number of perspectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.300" offset="1469593">First, three Federal courts of appeal have held this to be a physical taking because it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.344" offset="1493835">The local ordinance requires that we renew and that we cannot terminate any leases for present tenants as well as prospective tenants.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.792" offset="1547543">Because I have a little trouble grasping that.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.574" offset="1554752">Yes, Your Honor, the ordinance by itself achieves this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.594" offset="1566769">You have... prior to the passage of the ordinance, the park owner has effective ability to control who will get an invitation onto his land.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.073" offset="1608669">And if I could put this in context, it is the Florida Power case that says it's the invitation that makes the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.077" offset="1632702">And Loretto tells us the invitation has to be offered by someone who has the authority to give the invitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.052" offset="1660601">As this Court will recall in Loretto, the prior owner... the cable company was not a stranger to the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.515" offset="1682439">The prior owner had given consent to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.778" offset="1695500">Then Mrs. Loretto came on, bought the property, looked around, told the cable company we're revoking your invitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.969" offset="1720264">And under those circumstances, this Court had no problem in finding that continued occupancy under compulsion of the law, was a physical per se taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.037" offset="1760597">Exactly the same thing occurs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.338" offset="1769792">The owner remains the same, the tenants are different, and the departing tenant who doesn't have the right but for the law invites the incoming tenant in, who's then an interloper with a Government license, and the ordinance causes the owner to become disabled from controlling that access.</text>

Hirsch, that no coaches are selling for below Blue Book value anywhere in the State of California but for two rural jurisdictions, where the plentitude of space is apparently puts a down pressure on the selling price of coaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.479" offset="6810380">But secondly, as a matter of logic, the park owner can only raise rents at the time of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.672" offset="6835144">He wants the sale to occur and, as a consequence, would facilitate the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.507" offset="6854475">And third, it violates the close-fit notions of Nollan in any event because if you're concerned about the park owner depressing prices so that he can buy the coach, pass a law that says something like the park owner can only buy at Blue Book value and not less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.546" offset="6910586">Or, if you're concerned about a third person coming in, say to the third person... or say to the park owner, you can only charge rents that are charged in comparable spaces in areas that are near us in non-rent-controlled environments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.005" offset="7572424">Petitioners' counsel has explicitly conceded, both prior to this appearance and here before the Court today, that if this case involved merely rent control, there would be no serious constitutional issue posed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.892" offset="7623938">Petitioners, prior to this argument, seemed to have conceded because they did not challenge the State statute itself, that California's residency law, which requires park owners to permit homeowners to sell their homes in place and to lease those properties to an incoming home purchaser, is itself not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.366" offset="7709933">I assume that concession to have been based on the Connecticut decisions that this Court has summarily affirmed in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.208" offset="7729263">I understood him to say that the same... essentially the same provision was in the rent control ordinance, and that's why he didn't challenge the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.096" offset="7768761">The problem with that argument, Justice Stevens, is that the rent control in Escondido simply fills in interstitially where the State statute otherwise doesn't control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.782" offset="7811497">So by its own force, at least as things stand right now, that there is no provision that you could enforce through city law to guarantee the hold over tenants' rights under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.961" offset="7860294">Those rights are derived from the State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.729" offset="8023298">Although I don't read him to have challenged in any of his briefs directly and exclusively the notion that the holdover tenancy provisions that are embodied in the State law are by themselves unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.197" offset="8069169">Certainly no... as I understood his argument, he was saying that there are these two... two courts of appeals who have reached these conclusions, neither of which has been prepared to condemn the holdover provisions by themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.082" offset="8112741">And in fact, the Ninth Circuit expressly recognized that that's a very different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.226" offset="8129355">So... but you may be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.356" offset="8133848">It's not a concession, but it seems to me settled law at this stage, that those two forms of regulation are clearly permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.511" offset="8162478">Where petitioners, I think, now urge the Court to draw the constitutional line is when these two forms of otherwise perfectly permissible regulation overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.588" offset="8198736">And in that case, their argument is that this is no longer even a more serious regulatory takings issue under the Fifth Amendment, but that these two forms of regulation are mystically converted into an occupation of physical property, and therefore, requires per se condemnation under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.758" offset="8267490">There are two fundamental flaws in the petitioners' arguments that will be the main theme of my argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.831" offset="8287761">First, the presence of more than one form of regulation by a governmental entity may complicate the regulatory takings analysis, but it does not convert the regulatory scheme into an occupation or into physical invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.440" offset="8350142">And it seems to me it particularly does not raise any more serious constitutional concerns here, with each layer of regulation is designed to protect a segment of the society that is clearly requiring protection by the Government because they are unable economically to protect themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.364" offset="8421926">This leads me to the second flaw in the petitioners' argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.616" offset="8434883">And that is that they do not have a legally protected property interest that they claim to have been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.489" offset="8458393">I heard counsel today indicate that there's an estate in land, that there's a property right, that there's a massive shift in economic resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="2116.419" offset="8622129">Of course, the difficulty that that poses is that that same right to exclude would create problems in the civil rights laws, and yet he conceded quite plainly that at least on an occupational theory, that those provisions are in no sense placed into jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.069" offset="8688689">And it's simply impossible to reconcile an argument that says that those statutes are clearly permissible, those occupations, in quote, not troublesome at all, and yet this one, which involves simply sort of economic regulation, is suddenly rendered a per se unconstitutional act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.406" offset="13298047">Third, the kind of trial that the petitioners call for in this case looks very different to me than what I would expect for per se analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.443" offset="13334201">Questions about what are the property values, between when you have one set of regulatory arrangements or another set of regulatory arrangements, and do mobile homes appreciate or depreciate in value, are not the kinds inquiries that I ordinarily associate with a per se kind of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.934" offset="13400134">They look like a regulatory type of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.596" offset="13410792">And finally, I don't think petitioners have in any way justified, at least in my mind, why it is that the Court would take what has heretofore been a, I think, reasonably useful physical occupation rule that per se condemns certain activities and completely create the same inexactness and uncertainty that's necessarily inherent in the regulatory takings doctrine as the Court recognized in Penn Central.</text>
