            <text syncTime="18.413" offset="218651">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.103" offset="229413">Forsyth County, which is a political subdivision of the State of Georgia, comes before you to ask you to reverse a decision of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals which invalidated as unconstitutional on its face our Ordinance 34, which is our parade ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.337" offset="298377">That ordinance imposes a fee for the use of county property for expressive purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.210" offset="325857">The court below found that the cap that we have on this fee of $1,000 exceeded a nominal amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.416" offset="354697">They based that finding on a reading of a case of this Court from 1943 called Murdock v. Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.602" offset="391477">That case, we feel, does not say what the Eleventh Circuit says it says, and we believe that the true precedent to rely upon in our case is Cox v. New Hampshire, a 1941 case of this Court, wherein at the beginning of the consideration of the fee in the New Hampshire statute, this Court said that there remains the question of license fees, which as the court said, referring to the New Hampshire court, had a permissible range from $300 to a nominal amount, a recognition we believe that indicates there is a difference between $300 and a nominal amount in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.927" offset="544763">We believe the base upon which this Court utilized in Cox to reach its conclusion there, may begin with a review of the Constitution, article 4, section 3 of the second paragraph which grants Congress, and I quote: the power to make all needful rules and regulations respecting property belonging to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.450" offset="626788">The Tenth Amendment reserves to the States those powers not otherwise taken away from them by the Constitution, and this Court then in Cox stated basically that it was undoubted that there is authority in a local government to control the use of its property.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.511" offset="695124">We believe that if this were not a government, and if it did not involve the First Amendment, that there would be no question that charging a fee for the use of one's own property would be accepted as an inherent right of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.582" offset="759386">What this case represents is a clash between that inherent right of property ownership and the public's First Amendment rights to use public property for First Amendment purposes.</text>
