            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="125526">We'll hear argument now in No. 112 Original, Wyoming against Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.278" offset="158545">Mr. Leader, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_leader" startTime="47.421" stopTime="212.880">
            <label>Mr. Neal Leader</label>
            <text syncTime="47.421" offset="315175">Mr. Chief Justice, and maybe it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="52.326" offset="334819">You are asked today, I believe, to establish a dangerous precedent, not a dangerous precedent in the area of Commerce Clause law, but a dangerous precedent in the area of your original jurisdiction, for today in this original action, Wyoming makes a Commerce Clause challenge to an Oklahoma law that requires coal-burning utilities in Oklahoma who sell to Oklahoma consumers to burn at least 10 percent coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.213" offset="446310">This challenge is brought, however, on the basis of an indirect taxing interest, an interest in collecting coal severance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.969" offset="481314">The essence of Wyoming's claim is that Oklahoma's law results in the private Wyoming coal producers having a smaller share of Oklahoma's coal market.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.516" offset="527498">This reduction in market share, Wyoming argues, and I will argue later, but it does not prove, reduces Wyoming coal production, which in turn lowers severance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.456" offset="583296">Oklahoma's position is that the exercise of original jurisdiction to adjudicate a Commerce Clause challenge based on an alleged indirect loss of tax revenue is (1) inappropriate, (2) not necessary, and it will very likely popularize a new trend which I will refer to as end-running, and I will discuss that new trend in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.894" offset="693010">As this Court has recognized, the exercise of original jurisdiction by this Court is a serious intrusion on society's interest in the Court's most deliberate and considerate performance of its paramount role as a supreme Federal appellate court, and original jurisdiction should only be assumed when justified by the strictest necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.689" offset="788200">To permit a State to maintain a Commerce Clause challenge to protect an indirect tax interest is not strictly necessary and not appropriate because it invites mischief.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.089" offset="841804">It invites a new game, a game called end-running, where someone who is engaged in commerce and the commerce is taxed and they want to challenge another State's statute, but they don't want to have to come up through the district court and the appeals system, end-runs the traditional system by going to the Government and say, you taxed this, you bring an original action.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.774" offset="944622">And then we wind up with an appearance of State qua State saying, we are interested in our taxes--</text>

            <text syncTime="221.455" offset="1011286">--we are dealing with commerce, Your Honor, and almost everything that moves in commerce is at one place taxed, one place or another taxed by the State, and that is why it is so dangerous in this particular area.</text>

          <turn speaker="neal_leader" startTime="236.046" stopTime="255.498">
            <label>Mr. Neal Leader</label>
            <text syncTime="236.046" offset="1069696">I am saying the State certainly does care, but I am stating it is not necessary for the State to come here to get relief, and therefore, original jurisdiction shouldn't allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.333" offset="1114835">Secondly, I am saying that the danger is that we have the appearance of State qua State, but we really have a State qua shill for the local industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.498" offset="1147436">Mr. Leader, what would be the perceived advantages from the point of view of the Commerce Clause plaintiff in going for original jurisdiction rather than in coming up through either the State or Federal court system?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_leader" startTime="270.608" stopTime="297.406">
            <label>Mr. Neal Leader</label>
            <text syncTime="270.608" offset="1207936">Having a final answer for the entire country, that... don't have to worry about being overturned so simply another time.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.205" offset="1246284">Secondly, I assume it is proceeded as speedier, if you get here, and can start here, you become the Court or the forum of first choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.430" offset="1287244">It saves time and money because you don't have all those layers of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.284" offset="1302604">So there are several advantages here that would invite the danger.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="297.406" offset="1315142">I don't understand how we come off... you mean whenever a State has a valid interest and a sufficient interest to confer standing, article 3 standing, we should still and all inquire case by case whether somehow that interest is what?</text>
            <text syncTime="323.284" offset="1418587">Significant enough to justify the risk of end-running that you refer to?</text>
            <text syncTime="330.428" offset="1447217">I mean, I can understand an argument that there is no State interest here or not the sufficiently direct interest that would confer standing, but that is not the argument you are making.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_leader" startTime="338.914" stopTime="340.586">
            <label>Mr. Neal Leader</label>

            <label>Mr. Neal Leader</label>
            <text syncTime="341.327" offset="1490790">My first argument is, because of the dangers involved here, and because of the other forums that are available, the strictest necessity test simply is not met in this kind of case.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.388" offset="1567067">In other words, if we think there are an awful lot of these complaints being filed, we do not have to take the... allow the complaints to be filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.499" offset="1631433">[Laughter]</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="neal_leader" startTime="377.099" stopTime="577.972">
            <label>Mr. Neal Leader</label>
            <text syncTime="377.099" offset="1633836">--The use of original jurisdiction is not necessary here because first, the real party's interests, the Wyoming coal producers, have both Federal and State courts available to them, and truly, if this indirect tax interest is enough to justify the cost of litigation, the direct impact would motivate the actual movers in commerce similarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.940" offset="1761209">Secondly, the State could have sued the State utility companies here in either State or Federal court and sought injunctive relief and declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.290" offset="1818679">The State is also not prohibited from encouraging the people who are actually affected from bringing suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.994" offset="1841457">The State is not prohibited from helping the movers in commerce from bringing the action, or given the proper appropriation, not prohibited from funding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.559" offset="1883671">In short, there are sufficient alternatives to have this issue resolved, and the strict necessity which you say is, was to guard your original jurisdiction has not been met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.349" offset="1934871">We say the special master erred in finding that this was an appropriate case for original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.122" offset="1957964">Secondly, we say that the special master erred in finding that this indirect tax interest conferred sufficient standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.198" offset="1994222">There is no Supreme Court case that we have been able to find that recognizes this indirect taxing interest as justifying standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.463" offset="2027345">We would urge the Court to follow the teachings of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals case in Philadelphia v. Kleppe.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.939" offset="2057229">In that case the State of Pennsylvania sued the Small Business Administration, challenging that agency's classification of a hurricane-damaged area as a Class B disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.556" offset="2103727">Pennsylvania claimed that its taxing revenue and economy were damaged by the mistake in classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.111" offset="2133924">The court of appeals rejected this vicarious injury as the basis of standing, saying, impairment of State tax revenue should not, in general, be recognized as sufficient injury in fact to support State standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.921" offset="2193170">And the court goes on and says, we need a direct link between the State statute and the collection of taxes, and then says, this would prevent State standing in cases like the present one where the diminution of tax receipts is largely an incidental result of the challenged activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.455" offset="2271328">Now, even if on occasion this indirect taxing collection interest could justify standing, that interest has not been shown here.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.612" offset="2323887">As this Court noted in Duke Power Company v. California Environmental Study Group, to show standing a plaintiff must (1) show direct and palpable injury to the plaintiff, and a fairly traceable causal connection between the claimed injury and the challenged conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.335" offset="2406852">Here, Wyoming has failed to prove those elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.179" offset="2430153">And certainly--</text>

            <text syncTime="641.351" offset="2690855">They simply have not shown there is a connection between this lost market share of the producers and their severance tax collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.838" offset="2728785">They offer two pieces of evidence to attempt to show it.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.000" offset="2745503">One is an affidavit of Richard Markel, who is the director of the Wyoming mining tax division.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.593" offset="2767864">His affidavit just assumes that there is a direct one-to-one relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.497" offset="2783433">If you lose a sale of 1 ton of coal or you have a sale of Oklahoma coal in Oklahoma, that is an automatic loss of tax revenue and he just multiplies.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.042" offset="3301598">There is no clear and convincing evidence in this case showing a relationship between the lost market share in Oklahoma and the ultimate production of Wyoming coal producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.068" offset="3345797">In fact, the evidence suggests that Wyoming coal producers keep producing more and more coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.682" offset="3372233">Now as to Oklahoma's statute itself, Oklahoma freely admits that its statute does not, in the constitutional sense, treat all evenhandedly, and that in fact, that it does aid coal production in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.555" offset="3439733">Part of this difference is based upon the difference in the properties of coal in each State.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.807" offset="3464706">As the uncontradicted, stipulated facts show, Oklahoma coal has a much higher BTU.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.684" offset="3496262">It takes approximately 1-1/2 pounds of Wyoming coal to equal the burning power, the BTU power of Oklahoma coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.740" offset="3532416">Oklahoma coal has a high sulfur content and Wyoming has a low sulfur content.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.723" offset="3560315">The purpose of the statute was to aid utilities, reduce and limit its reliance on this coal production connected by a single railroad, now two railroads, and to see that if there is a shutoff of fuel, they have some protections against those dangers there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.350" offset="4398845">It is clear in Oklahoma, and we use Oklahoma law to determine these areas, it is Oklahoma's statute... and a familiar rule of Oklahoma law is that an act of legislature, while invalid and inoperative as to one set of facts, may be constitutional and valid as to another and different set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.442" offset="4479198">Additionally, Oklahoma's jurisprudence provides that where a statute on its face is applicable to several classes of persons or cases, the constitutionality of the statute as applied to one class may be upheld at the same time as its applicability to another class is stricken down as unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.304" offset="4670728">In that case, in commenting on original jurisdiction, Chief Justice Fuller said, it is apparent that the jurisdiction is of so delicate and a grave a character that it was not contemplated that it would be exercised save when the necessity was absolute and the matter itself properly adjudicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1191.171" offset="4890156">The Oklahoma statute which the State of Wyoming has challenged is a classic example of economic protectionism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.013" offset="4917533">The statute is discriminatory because it has disrupted the current coal market by forcing Oklahoma utilities to purchase Oklahoma coal rather than the Wyoming coal that they were purchasing until the statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.145" offset="4974062">We urge this Court to adopt the special master's recommendation that you find the Oklahoma statute unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.220" offset="5006349">The statute is invalid because it, on its face, discriminates against interstate commerce.</text>
