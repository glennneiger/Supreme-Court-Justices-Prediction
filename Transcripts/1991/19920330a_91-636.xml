            <text syncTime="246.321" offset="1132022">In some states the regulations and laws are so lax as to create risks, but that's not true in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.873" offset="1154279">There is an even more important question, however, at stake in this case, and that's whether or not this Court is going to uphold the novel new constitutional principle that was relied upon by the Sixth Circuit in upholding the waste importation restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.265" offset="1223764">That new constitutional principle is that state legislation which excludes foreign commerce from local areas within the State does not discriminate against interstate commerce so long as like commerce from elsewhere in the State is subject to the same embargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.033" offset="1286876">Acceptance of that new principle would have extraordinary consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.896" offset="1302341">By way of illustration, if this principle were adopted by this Court a district comprised of the southern, the counties of Southern California could impose an embargo upon or a discriminatory tariff upon goods coming from Arizona so long as like commerce coming from Northern California were subject to the same constraint or the same discriminatory tariff.</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.852" offset="6994109">They have abandoned their claim that St. Clair County's refusal to amend their plan was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.197" offset="7019500">So the sole challenge in this Court is whether this comprehensive statewide statute is unconstitutional merely because it permits each county to consider local circumstances in deciding whether to permit or to prohibit out-of-state waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.938" offset="7078537">Under petitioner's view in this facial challenge a county can never prohibit out-of-state waste regardless of local circumstances or local consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.033" offset="7118870">Our position is that a state may implement a planning process, as we have done here, which permits counties to take into consideration of local circumstances.</text>
