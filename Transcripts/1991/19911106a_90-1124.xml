            <label>Mr. George H. Moyer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.320" offset="187385">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.733" offset="197103">In February of 1985 the Government made my client, Keith Jacobson, the target of an undercover sting operation known as the American Hedonist Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.681" offset="244855">The Government had no reason when it did that to believe that Mr. Jacobson had committed a crime, was planning to commit a crime, or was engaged in a course of criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.810" offset="289367">Between February 1985 and June 1987 the Government targeted Mr. Jacobson in five different and separate undercover operations, the object of each of which was to determine if he was receiving or trading sexually explicit photos depicting children through the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.991" offset="366063">After the third operation concluded on October 16, 1986 when Mr. Jacobson broke off correspondence with one Calvin Comfort, the Government's chief witness and a postal inspector masquerading as a Carl Long, the Government had even less reason to believe that Jacobson was likely to commit a crime than it did when it started with the American Hedonist Society more than a year earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.931" offset="485808">Just the same, Jacobson was included in Operation Looking Glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.014" offset="506184">That was sting number 5 in March of 1987, and was finally, after 28 months of Government effort, induced to receive a single magazine depicting a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.446" offset="563967">I contend that Mr. Jacobson was entrapped as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.309" offset="583402">I contend that where the defendant's predisposition to commit the crime charged in the indictment, to engage in criminal conduct, does not appear before Government agents target him.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.776" offset="633243">The Government has failed to prove that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.709" offset="652992">I also contend that where the defendant has been offered numerous opportunities to break the law and he has not done so, the Government should leave him alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="1297.956" offset="5341971">Another time that, of course, that he evidenced reluctance was when the American Hedonist Society sent him a list of supposed persons who supposedly had the same sexual interests as he had, and he did not correspond with any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.508" offset="5416159">At that juncture the Government itself prompted him by initiating the correspondence under the guise of Carl Long.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.934" offset="5445834">I think even more significantly, however, was the American Hedonist Society undercover operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.858" offset="5469554">The Hedonist Society had a letter called, The Little Light, a newsletter that he was supposed to get quarterly, and the postal inspector testified that he put his name on the mailing list and that he started to send him the newsletter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.968" offset="5525978">And then he was asked what did the American Hedonist Society offer its members, and he responded child pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.334" offset="5555444">Now, when they searched Mr. Jacobson's home they didn't find any newsletters, and we didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.988" offset="5578118">We looked, we couldn't find any ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.439" offset="5587940">And apparently he had thrown away all these newsletters which offered child pornography in the form of advertising which the postal inspectors had of course planted in the magazine, and he never responded to one of their ads, although I think the Court does have Exhibit 119(a) in which he did fill out an ad that he wanted to place but again which he never sent to the American Hedonist Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.116" offset="5694625">So by the time they get down here to this last operation, the Operation Looking Glass in which he finally buys the child pornography, they have tried him three different times and they have been unable to induce him in any of these three different undercover operations to buy child pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.000" offset="5778112">And if he got eight newsletters, which would be approximately the right number, between the time that he was enrolled in the Looking Glass survey and the time that he was enrolled in the Looking Glass sting and the time that he was enrolled in the Hedonist survey, then he would have been solicited in some way, in some form, for child pornography something like 8 to 11 times.</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.788" offset="6061279">But there were at least eight offers, and that is where the Carl Long correspondence was leading, because that's how the Carl Long tactic works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.964" offset="6090014">According to the agent who employed it, you try to mirror the personality of the individual with whom you are corresponding in order to find out what their interests are and, if they are willing, to get them to send you child pornography through the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.075" offset="6150409">And they were unable to get Mr. Jacobson sufficiently interested in the correspondence to even continue to write to the Government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.383" offset="6195653">Now, of course, the purpose of all this is plain from the Government's brief and the amicus briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.018" offset="6222194">They are trying to penetrate the child pornography underground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.252" offset="6239121">They are trying to see if this man is a man who collects child pornography and habitually sends it through the mails to other persons who have similar pedophilic interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.921" offset="6281857">And the fact that he didn't continue the Carl Long correspondence is pretty conclusive evidence that he was not a member of the child pornography underground and that he was not trading child pornography with other persons with pedophilic interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.329" offset="6335460">And at that point we contend that even if there was some evidence at the beginning that he had an interest in this stuff, it was crystal clear to the Government that he had not been breaking the law and was not breaking the law and couldn't be induced to breaking the law after the third sting operation, which was over a year after the first one, and at that point he should have been left alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.816" offset="6557397">Those magazines are demonstrably not, as the dissent below said and as petitioner has again said here today, mere nudist magazines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3179.511" offset="12868163">Mr. Moyer, I've been thinking, if we adopted that proposition that you are urging on us, that it's unlawful for the Government to approach a person unless the Government knows in advance of approaching him that he has the predisposition, then I guess the Government couldn't put an ad in a magazine, you know, that suggested that it has child pornography for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.197" offset="12958964">Right?</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.437" offset="12959905">Because that ad would get to all sorts of people, including people that don't have the predisposition, and any conviction derived from that would be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.523" offset="12988221">Is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.344" offset="12991460">Justice Scalia, I think you have to distinguish between the subparagraph (a) sting that the Attorney General describes in his guidelines and the column (b) sting, or subparagraph (b) sting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.984" offset="13050079">I think the ad is of the (b) sting variety and the pawn shop is of the (b) sting variety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.208" offset="13074948">In other words, you're putting up an opportunity for illegal activity which has been structured so that there is a reason for believing that those drawn to the opportunity are predisposed to commit it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.547" offset="13124371">I don't see a whole lot of difference between, you know, a throwaway in the mail and an ad in the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.524" offset="13148195">I mean, they're both standard ways of advertising the availability of something.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.055" offset="13166376">In this particular instance, Your Honor, it's clear that Mr. Jacobson was the target of a Government undercover operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.940" offset="13197932">He had not committed any crime before they targeted him, and that would clearly fall under subparagraph (a) where the Attorney General has said that there is a reasonable indication based on information developed through informants or other means that the subject is engaging, has engaged, or is likely to engage in illegal activities of a similar nature.</text>
