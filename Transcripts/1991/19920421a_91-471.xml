            <text syncTime="12.099" offset="198906">Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.723" offset="209355">The question in this case is whether Alabama's waste disposal tax, which is levied only on waste generated outside that state, discriminates against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.209" offset="255330">Petitioner Chemical Waste Management operates, owns and operates a hazardous waste disposal facility near Emelle, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.335" offset="283856">This facility is authorized to operate under both Federal and state law, and virtually every aspect of its operations are closely regulated by both the Federal Environmental Protection Agency and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.094" offset="334847">That regulation is designed to minimize to the greatest degree possible any threat to public health and the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.089" offset="358880">The statute challenged in this case levies a $72 per ton tax on waste disposed of at the Emelle facility that is generated outside Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.777" offset="397541">Waste generated within Alabama is not subject to the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.059" offset="410707">The trial court declared this statute invalid under the Commerce Clause on the ground that it impermissibly discriminates against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.533" offset="444561">The Alabama Supreme Court disagreed, holding that because the overall purpose of the tax was to protect public health and the environment, the Commerce Clause's antidiscrimination principle did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.693" offset="489283">We submit that the unconstitutionality of this provision is clear under long-settled Commerce Clause principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.566" offset="516764">A law that discriminates on its face against interstate commerce violates the Commerce Clause unless it advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable non-discriminatory alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.794" offset="565665">The Court has never found this test satisfied by a discrimination tax, save in one circumstance where the tax in fact is not economically discriminatory because it precisely compensates for an identical levy that is limited to in-state commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.550" offset="840682">In the quarantine cases the local interest that the Court identified was an interest in preventing any additional items of the particular good into the state at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.258" offset="887494">The state's interest was in reducing it to the minimum degree possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.481" offset="904421">Here that is not Alabama's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.361" offset="911944">That's not what the statute does, and in fact that's not the interest that respondents assert in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.805" offset="929707">Here they assert that Alabama's health and safety interest is in reducing volumes, keeping volume to some, what they regard as an acceptable level.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.611" offset="964920">And if volume is the question, then there is no, the out-of, the state of origin makes no difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.546" offset="1036705">It seems to me rather cruel to say that the less solicitous of her sister states Alabama is, the more we're going to punish her.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.410" offset="1076098">I mean, instead of saying we're not going to allow any states to dump anything here, they're saying well, you know, there may be some of our sister states that have real problems, and if they're really, you know, if it's that serious that they're willing to pay this amount per ton we'll let them do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1072.524" offset="4440565">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.512" offset="4480480">The very purpose of the Commerce Clause was to establish an area of free trade among the states and not to permit a multiplication of isolated trade zones within each of the separate states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.931" offset="4530217">And the Commerce Clause has been consistently construed by this Court to, of its own force in a self-executing manner to prohibit barriers imposed by the states to the free movement of commerce among the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.777" offset="4577551">In particular where a statute discriminates against interstate commerce, that statute can be sustained only if it serves a legitimate local purpose and if there is no available, excuse me, non-discriminatory means to accomplish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.590" offset="4636796">Beyond that in the special area of taxation, which we have here, the only discriminatory taxes that have been sustained have been ones that are in fact not discriminatory because they are designed to equalize a tax burden, excuse me, to compensate for a tax imposed on in-state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.270" offset="4711507">Now those purposes are present entirely in this current situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.983" offset="4734390">Hazardous wastes are generated as the by-product of essential industries in interstate commerce, petrochemicals, petroleum refining, others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.779" offset="4769603">To exempt an in-state industry from, generator of hazardous wastes, from the payment of a fee that out-of-state waste generators have to pay is exactly the sort of discrimination in favor of local industries against out-of-state industries that the Commerce Clause was designed to prohibit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1175.623" offset="4852986">You could say the same thing about diseased cattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.504" offset="4864480">To allow in-state ranches to have diseased cattle, but not to allow any out-of-state ranches to ship diseased cattle into the state is, you know... it's the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.634" offset="4924979">It does discriminate in favor of in-state people in a way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.146" offset="4935010">--It does, but there are several ways to look at the quarantine cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.140" offset="4950997">One of them is that, as the response to the Chief Justice illustrated a short time ago, in fact the quarantine cases are a subset of the category in which the state interest could not be served by any non-discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.627" offset="5005018">But there's another element of the quarantine cases which simply is not present here but I think is an essential element, and that is the element of imminence of the risk, urgency of the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.215" offset="5051307">A quarantine is an emphatic and swift remedy for a perceived urgent problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.690" offset="5073250">In fact in the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad case on which Alabama relies, the Court described the quarantine cases as essentially grounded in self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.228" offset="5115360">And one of the essential elements of self-defense is imminence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.452" offset="5132287">You are only entitled to take that action if there is an imminent harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.965" offset="5154334">And in Clason, for example, one of the cases cited, it was pointed out that the animals would begin to decay and cause harm within 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.611" offset="5188920">None of that is present here in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.282" offset="5199578">The hazardous wastes, as Mr. Pincus described, are subject to a comprehensive cradle to grave Federal regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.827" offset="5225805">From the time of generation through storage through transportation through treatment and disposal they are subject to a uniform minimum set of standards which can be supplemented by the states precisely to guard against those sorts of imminent risks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1285.137" offset="5291007">Mr. Kneedler, what if the state decided to start all over again from scratch and it could prove that in fact there was no safe way to handle the stuff, that in-state, out-of-state, it was all a health hazard regardless of what the Federal Government was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.368" offset="5355895">Does the fact that the Federal Government has enacted this comprehensive scheme for regulating transportation and treatment, or would that fact in effect bar us from considering the state's proof?</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.917" offset="5418171">In other words, has the congressional action in effect said this material is going to be treated, must be treated for Commerce Clause purposes as an article of commerce which is not subject to the quarantine rules.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="1332.438" offset="5480238">I don't know whether it would be an absolute bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.072" offset="5490791">I think Alabama's burden would be weighty indeed, because Congress has, by taking this problem firmly in hand and by treating what might otherwise be a local activity such as the generation of waste in the same way that raising cattle might ordinarily be local, but by taking it entirely in hand in this Federal regulatory scheme and including the transportation of waste, Congress has really treated it as a national problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.665" offset="5581175">And as a consequence of that there has been a national interstate industry growing up around the various aspects of hazardous waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.853" offset="5613880">As we point out in our briefs there are, as a consequence of the Federal statute and amendments to it there are important incentives to adopt treatment of hazardous waste before they can be disposed in land disposal sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.334" offset="5675843">And those treatment requirements are often capital intensive, and it would be duplicative at best and counter-productive at worst to require a landfill in every state in fact to require the various types of disposals of hazardous wastes in all of the 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.938" offset="5754210">As we point out in our brief, every state in the Union exports some hazardous waste, and the average state exports to 19 other states to take advantage of at least 12 disposal or treatment sorts of technologies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.248" offset="5815441">So what has grown up partly under the impetus of the regulatory scheme which has become much more complex since the time this Court considered RCRA in the background of Philadelphia v. New Jersey has been one that treats this problem as a national problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.467" offset="5876359">And so we would, the Federal Government and EPA would be quite concerned about the reintroduction of attempts by the states to as it were try to improve on that system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.605" offset="5920871">If the states believe that additional incentives are required, if certain states now sited with land disposal facilities believed that certain incentives are required for other states to develop additional sites that would not be redundant, then the proper course is to take that to Congress, which can authorize through authorizing taxes, even discriminatory taxes, or other incentives, can take steps that are necessary to make sure the adequate capacity is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.917" offset="6046155">But that has not happened here, and Alabama instead has tried to take matters into its own hands by adopting what it thinks is a proper regulation of what is after all interstate commerce, by imposing a tax at a level it thinks is appropriate to regulate, as it were, the movement of goods from one state to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.808" offset="6117730">That's a function that's assigned to Congress under the Commerce Clause, not to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.711" offset="6133299">And I think that gets to the reason why a tax rather than a ban, even though it may seem lesser included, doesn't survive on the quarantine theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.540" offset="6176663">It's because the state, the state's interest is much more indirect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.302" offset="6191709">The point that was pointed out in the Baldwin case, Baldwin v. Seelig, that said if there is a, if there is the sort of state interest that requires that kind of immediate action it calls for an immediate response, not the kind of indirect regulation that a tax will do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.709" offset="6293273">First of all there may be a question as to whether RCRA would allow a total ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.111" offset="6310932">But if there was a total ban there would be a question to what extent that was consistent with the state's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.526" offset="6336532">If the total ban was premised on the kind of imminent danger, clear and present danger that the quarantine cases have been premised on, if the state could make that factual showing, then it might bring itself within the quarantine cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.205" offset="6395255">The difference here is that Alabama is not trying to regulate against imminent harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.387" offset="6411974">Quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.799" offset="6417720">Most of the harms that Alabama cites in here are ones that are 20, 30, 40 years down the road and speculative at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.452" offset="6444261">And in trying to regulate to serve those purposes the State is essentially second guessing RCRA and the surplus scheme that have been set up by Congress to do the best that Congress can on the basis of current knowledge in the area to guard against and impose financial requirements to insure against long-term damage to local economies and the local environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.272" offset="6547601">So I think that the, Alabama's effort to bring this case within the quarantine rationale is fundamentally misguided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.387" offset="6576023">In fact it's Philadelphia v. New Jersey which answers this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.130" offset="6590965">There the Court did not disturb the New Jersey Supreme Court's conclusion that the statute there furthered important environmental concerns and in fact hazardous wastes were embraced by the New Jersey statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.345" offset="6631820">But the Court said that the ultimate purpose of the New Jersey statute was irrelevant if in furthering that purpose the state engaged in the sort of discrimination that the Commerce Clause would otherwise prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.205" offset="6683334">And that's exactly what New Jersey did in that case by discriminating against out-of-state commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.939" offset="6706217">And that is not some new fangled notion that came up in Philadelphia v. New Jersey.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.737" offset="6941423">Modern Commerce Clause concepts have never been previously confronted in this Court with a hazardous waste police power control case, and as we consider that I would suggest there are three key factors in this case to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.843" offset="7029822">One, that hazardous wastes are inherently dangerous to human safety and to the environment and to the health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.361" offset="7071931">There is just simply no safe way to permanently landfill hazardous waste, and the record in this case is full of documentation on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.990" offset="7122400">Now, as such, considering the imminent and the inherent dangers and also the fact there is no safe way to permanently landfill hazardous waste, do the Commerce Clause, the typical Commerce Clause protections inure to toxic items of this type?</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.737" offset="7225427">Second factor, at the very least the unique problems of hazardous waste and the landfilling of hazardous waste should be considered if the Alabama statute is subjected to the usual balancing test or the strict scrutiny test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.319" offset="7299719">And the third factor we would submit is that the national interest would be better served by upholding Alabama's differential fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.637" offset="13149058">And what is going to happen if the Court submitted the fact that if the Court... that it would be in the national interest for the Court to uphold Alabama's differential fee, because if it's not upheld, if this is struck down, then the states like Alabama are really going to have to be thinking long and hard before they subject their people to the problems that would result from their locating a hazardous waste landfill within their own, within their own district, because the difficulty, again, is something unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.695" offset="13325227">And this is a problem that can be distinguished from any of the tax cases, any of the highway cases that have been cited in petitioner's brief, that this is really not a Commerce Clause case, we submit, so much as a police power case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.375" offset="13379980">And that in this instance the record, so totally different from the New Jersey case, shows an effort by Alabama to do the two things, one, to reduce the large quantities of hazardous waste coming in from out-of-state which in part has been accomplished, and then, and then to compensate for the transfer of risk.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>

            <text syncTime="3473.143" offset="14043072">First of all, the reliance on volumes from out-of-state is a complete red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.957" offset="14066269">This is a per ton tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.697" offset="14073270">If there are greater volumes from out-of-state, out-of-staters will pay more because the tax is imposed on every ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.111" offset="14094899">Second of all, respondents argue again that they're being responsible in taking care of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.288" offset="14127605">On that theory a state should be able to restrict access to hospitals within the state to its own citizens because it would prefer to take care of its own health problem and other states should take care of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.053" offset="14166684">That argument has been consistently rejected in City of Philadelphia and all of this Court's Commerce Clause cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.886" offset="14189985">Basically the claim here is that the national solution, the national process hasn't worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.021" offset="14210569">Then Alabama can go to Congress and pass, get relief the way that the states with nuclear disposal sites did and got the Low Level Radioactive Waste Act passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.247" offset="14247454">Finally, this compensation argument that the amount of the tax can be balanced against risks is again totally baseless in this Court's jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.234" offset="14283399">If that were right, a state that had a manufacturing facility could impose an export tax on the theory that its residents bore the burdens of air and water pollution, but the out-of-staters didn't, so that it shouldn't, its residents shouldn't have to pay the tax but the out-of-staters should.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.413" offset="14340137">That would destroy the national union that the framers wanted and lead each state to impose these disparate economic burdens in order to achieve some rough parity, and that's not what the Commerce Clause is about.</text>
