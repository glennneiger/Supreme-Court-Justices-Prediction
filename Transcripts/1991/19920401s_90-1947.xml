            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.406" offset="128479">This case is here on certiorari to the California Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.930" offset="150527">The petitioners own mobile home parks in Escondido, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.966" offset="174664">The City has a local rent control ordinance applicable to mobile home parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.525" offset="200891">In this suit against the City, the petitioners alleged that the city rent control ordinance in conjunction with California's mobile home residency law amounts to a physical occupation of their land because it enables tenants to remain on the land indefinitely at below market rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.286" offset="295976">They contend that the ordinance on its face constitutes a taking of their property under the Fifth Amendment entitling them to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.561" offset="333070">The California Superior Court dismissed the petitioner's complaint and the California Court of Appeal affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.747" offset="361805">In an opinion filed today, we affirm the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.934" offset="382599">A land owner has a per se right to compensation under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment for the physical occupational of his land only where the government requires the land owner to submit to physical occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.189" offset="443516">Because the petitioners have voluntarily rented their land to others and because the ordinance on its face neither compels petitioners to let others on their land nor requires them to continue renting their property once they have chosen to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.379" offset="508300">Petitioners cannot assert a per se right to compensation under the Takings Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.488" offset="532750">Rather than authorizing the physical occupation of petitioner's property, the ordinance instead regulates the use of petitioner's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.493" offset="572770">Petitioner's takings claim must therefore be assessed under our jurisprudence applicable to regulatory takings not as a physical taking automatically giving rise to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.865" offset="630239">For the reasons stated in the opinion, we find that petitioner's regulatory takings argument is not properly before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.148" offset="671408">Justice Blackmun and Justice Souter have each filed opinions concurring in the judgment.</text>
