            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="11.292" offset="136004">This case is here on petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.449" offset="156588">It is yet another bankruptcy case presenting the question whether Section 106(c) of the Bankruptcy Code waives the sovereign immunity of the United States in an action seeking monetary recovery in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.840" offset="214162">Soon after the respondent Nordic Village, Inc. filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, one of its officers withdrew funds from the company's corporate account.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.077" offset="263168">He set a portion of the money to the Internal Revenue Service directing it to apply the funds against his individual tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.583" offset="293156">The IRS did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.176" offset="303501">In a subsequent adversary proceeding, the Bankruptcy Court permitted the trustee for Nordic Village to recover the transfer and entered a monetary judgment against the IRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.732" offset="345715">The District Court affirmed as did the Court of Appeals which rejected a jurisdictional defense that sovereign immunity barred the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.229" offset="375703">We reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.731" offset="381764">Subsection 106(c) of the Bankruptcy Code does not unequivocally waive the United States sovereign immunity from an action seeking monetary recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.245" offset="419798">In contrast to Subsections 106(a) and (b) which plainly waive immunity with regard to monetary relief as to specify types of claims, Subsection 106(c) is susceptible of at least two plausible interpretations that do not authorize monetary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.689" offset="489597">Contrary to respondent's suggestion, legislative history has no bearing on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.476" offset="508719">The unequivocal expression of waiver that we require must be an expression in the statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.450" offset="532647">Respondent's alternative grounds for affirming the judgment also are unpersuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.588" offset="549156">Neither the broad jurisdictional grant of 28 U.S.C. Section 1334(d), the Bankruptcy Courts in rem jurisdiction, nor trust law principles supply the necessary waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.707" offset="597640">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun has joined.</text>
