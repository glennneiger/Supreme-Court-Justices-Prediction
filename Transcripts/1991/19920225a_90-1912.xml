            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143832">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-1912, Stephanie Nordlinger against Kenneth Hahn.</text>

            <text syncTime="8.358" offset="177164">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.250" offset="196808">The principal question presented by this case is whether California's welcome stranger method violates the equal protection clause by taxing newly purchased property at many times higher rates than property owned by long-time owners, without any possibility of seasonably attaining rough equality in tax treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.802" offset="274967">Just 3 years ago in the Allegheny decision, this Court unanimously concluded that there was no rational basis to justify welcome stranger assessment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.399" offset="313419">The fact that California's welcome stranger system is formally embodied in the State law is not a valid distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.644" offset="342363">We say it can't make a difference; the respondents say it must make a different.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.357" offset="361171">For argument--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="55.298" offset="364932">We did reserve that question in the Allegheny case, did we not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carlyle_w_hall_jr" startTime="57.140" stopTime="109.445">
            <label>Mr. Carlyle W. Hall, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="57.140" offset="372351">--Yes, you did.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.801" offset="374963">And for argument's sake let's assume that there might be a difference, and look to see whether there should be a difference, based on whether there are any practical differences in operation or in effects or in justifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.361" offset="433269">In terms of the practical operations, the two welcome stranger systems function in an identical fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.785" offset="466914">Basically, they both set up two groups of taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.879" offset="483319">There is a favored group of taxpayers who are going to pay very low effective rates of tax, based on low assessed values.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.073" offset="520100">Then there's the disfavored group of taxpayers who are the new buyers, who are going to be coming in to the system with base... with assessments based on high current market values, and therefore will be paying higher taxes and higher effective tax rates.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="109.445" stopTime="111.337">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="109.445" offset="581540">Of course, these are not static groups, are they?</text>
            <text syncTime="111.037" offset="587914">I mean--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carlyle_w_hall_jr" startTime="111.337" stopTime="112.437">
            <label>Mr. Carlyle W. Hall, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="111.337" offset="589168">No, that's exactly.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="112.437" stopTime="121.101">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="112.437" offset="593556">--today you may be a continuing resident, tomorrow decide to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.389" offset="605363">So it's not as though citizens are identified permanently in one or the other category.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carlyle_w_hall_jr" startTime="121.101" stopTime="228.734">
            <label>Mr. Carlyle W. Hall, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="121.101" offset="628142">No, that is true, that citizens are not identified permanently.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.734" offset="642666">And indeed, in terms of their being static groups, one of the interesting and curious things about the welcome stranger phenomenon is that it links these two groups together by having the change of ownership provision give higher tax assessments to the new groups and the new buyers, the new owners, and having the flat cap of 2 percent on the assessments for the old buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.938" offset="731483">So the two groups are intimately linked together, and over time as the tax rates change, as the assessments go up for the new buyers and as new money comes into the system, the effective tax rates for the long-time group is going to get lower and lower and lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.562" offset="810059">So it's a dynamic system that over time inevitably results in a skewing of the system so that the effective tax rates of the low tax group get lower and lower and lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.481" offset="865752">And the result of that is that you get these enormous disparities that you found in the Allegheny case, where you had 35 to 1 disparities that the Court characterized as gross disparities.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.990" offset="915698">And in California our court of appeal took judicial notice of the fact that our common gross disparities are of that same magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.105" offset="952165">And, indeed, the California Supreme Court just last month, although it didn't take this case up for review, did characterize those kinds of disparities and the way they come about as a wild-card system.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.333" offset="997096">And that's easily seen if you just look at how it treats like taxpayers, like properties, in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.050" offset="1035966">You could have identical houses next door to each other and they would be taxed dramatically differently, one tax--</text>

            <text syncTime="228.734" offset="1058745">Well, Mr. Hall, in West Virginia, I suppose the State law required that properties be put on the rolls at current value.</text>

            <text syncTime="1509.303" offset="6181043">The equal protection analysis of this case is just as simple as it is compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.701" offset="6226601">There is no justified classification; there is no fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.036" offset="6247917">So the question is not whether California could have done it done it some other better way, or whether the way that it chose is even good policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.918" offset="6275502">The only question is whether California's acquisition value assessment system furthers some legitimate State purpose, and clearly it does, for reasons that have already been identified by Justice O'Connor and other members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.998" offset="6331822">This was a very serious problem with which California was dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.940" offset="6343525">People had remarkable increases in their balance sheet, but they didn't have the corresponding money to pay the corresponding increases in taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.166" offset="6380410">Over a period of 10 years, prior to 1978, the legislature tried no fewer than 19 times to deal with the problem, but none was really effective because none attacked the problem at its core, which was a combination of unusually escalating real estate prices in the State of California, in the 1960's and 1970's, coupled with a current value assessment property tax scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.620" offset="6474242">California voters adopted a four-part response, and the part that's at issue here is the one that simply says, for the first time in history, so far as I know... and California is the only State that's done it... in response to a correspondingly serious problem we are just going to unhitch our properties tax assessment from current value, and instead we are going to tie it, basically, to an acquisition value basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.297" offset="6569014">Key to the analysis of this case is the fact that the California courts... Mr. Hall, to my astonishment, purports to have found what the true basis of this Proposition 13 really was, and he said that the Jarvis and Gan groups have themselves identified, that they have just found a way that they could tie this, that they could shift their... tax to someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.083" offset="6660129">That is not the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.883" offset="6667339">I invite the Court to read the pages of the Gan Jarvis briefs to which he cites, and they don't say that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.508" offset="6697850">But in any event, fortunately what we do have is a statement by the California Supreme Court of the three purposes, perfectly legitimate purposes, for Proposition 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.865" offset="6731287">The first one is, to prevent the taxation of unrealized appreciation in the value of property, and of course, that basically got at the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.549" offset="6765977">And the second is provide for certainty in the amount of taxes that a person was going to have to pay by tying the amount of the taxes, basically, to the amount that that person was willing to pay at the time that he or she bought the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.607" offset="6814252">You know, the problem that they were dealing with was that the property owners had no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.110" offset="6840270">That's why they were losing their homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.123" offset="6848315">They had no way to control what the future increase in property taxes is, but--</text>

            <text syncTime="1846.276" offset="7528857">If you start from the premise as my opponents do, that any scheme that is not tied to market value is unconstitutional, then it doesn't matter whether that comes about by constitutional amendment, by an erratic operation, an erratic practice of the assessor or anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.803" offset="7619032">And that is necessarily their premise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.125" offset="7632302">That is necessarily their premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.465" offset="7637631">The only constitutionally acceptable scheme is one that ties to market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.461" offset="7665634">Now, if you start from that premise, then of course those cases become relevant, that it doesn't matter who it comes about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.554" offset="7686010">If, on the other hand, your basis for analysis is the rational basis test and you ask first of all, what was California trying to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.717" offset="7718611">And then you ask, is there some reasonable fit between Proposition 13 and what they were trying to do, then it does matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.663" offset="7754451">It does matter, the difference between California's constitution and West Virginia's constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.626" offset="7774304">Because it is crucial because they... identifies the different purposes, and the purpose itself also provides the base sign by which you judge the tie, the necessary fit, between those two schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.856" offset="7827176">What the case really comes down to... what the case really comes down to, is whether California is constitutionally entitled to adopt a different scheme than West Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2609.739" offset="10582781">Or I have two responses to that, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.872" offset="10591244">One is that we have never assumed that there has to be a one-to-one matching, benefits to what you pay, from the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.065" offset="10620083">Tax policy can be used for the achievement of a number of other nontax... and that's simply one of the premises of our tax policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.192" offset="10660521">And the other is, if we just said that we will use those revenues for the same purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.576" offset="10690092">I will submit this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.029" offset="10695943">You read every word in my opponent's brief and you listen to every word that has been said here orally today, and what it necessarily all comes back to is that you have to, as a consequence of something that is said in the Fourteenth Amendment, tie your property... if you're going to call it a property tax, you have to tie it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.919" offset="10771489">You have to tie the assessment system to the current value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.684" offset="10794477">There are cases in which this Supreme Court... in which this Court has said that that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.136" offset="10812345">In related contexts, it can be tied, for example, to nominal value or par value, rather than current value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.480" offset="10841706">Say just a word about the other argument that is made, and that is the right to travel argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.208" offset="10880576">In the first place, it's not properly before this Court, if the Court applies using the Prudential rules, because even though Ms. Nordlinger has article 3 case or controversy standing to make the argument, she is not a person affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.719" offset="10942643">And under Moose Lodge v. Irvis, which is square on point on this issue, since she is not one who has moved interstate, she does not have standing to make this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.305" offset="10980991">And on the merits, this just isn't the kind of case... even if she were from out of State... this just isn't a right to travel kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.792" offset="11018921">It applies equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.931" offset="11023519">The triggering feature is not travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.454" offset="11037625">The triggering feature is acquisition of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.287" offset="11056955">And it would be an improper expansion of this Court's right to travel cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.675" offset="11098438">What the case comes down to, I submit, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.084" offset="11112126">Inflation in the price of real estate in the State of California over the past 20 years has been a reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.601" offset="11150160">It's going to cause some problems to someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.533" offset="11157892">It caused serious problems in the 1960's and 1970's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.075" offset="11176074">It has caused other problems, as Mr. Hall has pointed out, since 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.238" offset="11196763">There are six briefs, amicus briefs, who say that the problems that the problems that Proposition 13 has created are very serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.268" offset="11240857">There are a few more than that that say what it cured, the problems that it eliminated prior to 1978, are much more serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.242" offset="11280772">Now, who's right?</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.164" offset="11284430">Who's right?</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.155" offset="11288400">Are the problems of possibly being taxed out of your homes and not knowing what kind of financial obligations you're going to have more serious than the problem of an imbalance between property tax... between the value and the amount of tax you pay?</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.505" offset="11353811">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.637" offset="11358304">I don't think anyone... well, different Californians will have different views on that issue, but that's a matter for Californians to solve themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="2811.441" offset="11389546">Of course, an easy way to solve it would just be as inflation pushes the price up and up, just lower the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.975" offset="11411698">There's no reason why the fact that there's an unreasonable inflation in the value of property has to result in unreasonably high taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2846.383" offset="11529354">And I can give you a lot of other examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.734" offset="11538758">Examples abound of how we can eliminate anomalies in the tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.559" offset="11557984">But that is not the judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.810" offset="11566970">The judicial function is a very simple one, for which every member of this Court should be very grateful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.344" offset="11589122">And that is that you just ask, was there a serious problem that California was trying to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.796" offset="11610960">And second, did they deal with it in a responsible way that demonstrated some kind of a reasonable fit... some kind of a reasonable fit between what they were trying to deal with, and what they in fact did?</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.827" offset="11671042">I submit that in this case, the answer to that question... the answer to that question has to be yes, and that the judgment of the lower courts should be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carlyle W. Hall, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2897.949" offset="11735616">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.968" offset="11739692">With respect to Justice Kennedy's question about exceptions to the acquisition value premise of this system, I'd also point out that all of property that has a 1975 base year, which is approximately 44 percent of the property in the State, is not operating according to the acquisition value premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.371" offset="11825269">It's all... it's had its basis increased up to 1975, irrespective of what the acquisition date or acquisition value was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.928" offset="11863512">With respect to whether we are asserting that there is a need for a current market value system, that's clearly not what we're saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.284" offset="11896949">And I think our briefs indicate that absolutely clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.668" offset="11914503">What we're saying is, you can't have a system... property tax system in which some people are taxed at current market values and other people are taxed at antiquated assessed values.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.901" offset="11951388">And this is not the first time that this Court has ever considered, or that there has ever been a welcome stranger system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.177" offset="11972495">Indeed, there was one in the Webster County case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.078" offset="11988064">And finally, I don't agree that... with Mr. Lee's characterization of what this case boils down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.681" offset="12010529">I think really what it comes down to is whether this Court really wants to get into the whole business of looking at the way State administers... administrators have administered State law, and whether they've reconciled State law policies with their own policies, and whether they've strayed too far from official State policies in their implementation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.916" offset="12091404">And that's the precise implication of what the respondents' attempted distinguishing of the Allegheny cases is, is that this Court would get into the business of measuring the compliance of State law officials... State executive and local officials... with how far they've strayed from some official State policy, as they've tried to adopt their own policies on a local basis or executive basis to temper those official policies.</text>
