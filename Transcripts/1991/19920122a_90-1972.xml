            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="11.369" offset="187893">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.522" offset="200432">This case brings before the Court an issue concerning the obligations of a prosecutor before a Federal grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.726" offset="233242">The Tenth Circuit has held that a prosecutor is obligated, on pain of dismissal of the indictment, to put before the grand jury substantial exculpatory evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.855" offset="289771">As a result, the court of appeals upheld the dismissal of the seven-count indictment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.529" offset="320491">That indictment charged in effect that the respondent had made false statements to four federally insured institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.068" offset="362704">The Tenth Circuit's rule in our view has no foundation in the history of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.843" offset="397709">And if it is adopted, the Tenth Circuit's approach will have very high costs, with complicated preliminary trials on guilt or innocence prior to the trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.672" offset="453088">This represents a change, and we believe it's a significant change, in the concept of the grand jury's function.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.538" offset="484540">The grand jury is a screening mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.739" offset="497392">It is there to determine whether probable cause exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.990" offset="510349">It is not an adversary proceeding, and thus historically, has not been charged with evaluating defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.208" offset="543263">Indeed, the traditional role of the grand jury is quite limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.859" offset="561862">As Justice O'Connor stated in her opinion in Mechanik, it is a group of citizens who are operating with a broad mandated and under a few clear rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.076" offset="606688">Those rules are embodied in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.300" offset="627586">That structure, the interposition of the grand jury between the prosecutor and the citizen is itself a protection of individual liberty.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="134.129" offset="678891">Well, Mr.... General Starr, do you take the position that never would it be appropriate for a Federal district court judge, as a matter of exercise of supervisory power over the courts, to dismiss without prejudice a case in which there is a glaring failure of the Government to present some evidence to the grand jury that would have a direct bearing on whether the suspect is indeed appropriately charged?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="174.444" stopTime="193.718">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="174.444" offset="840118">Our position is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.457" offset="848164">In terms of failure to adduce evidence, as opposed to what courts have, seen historically is quite problematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.672" offset="889124">And that is the use of perjurious testimony or other forms of flagrant misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.536" offset="912530">But at common law--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="193.718" offset="917232">Now, if the prosecutor offered known false testimony to the grand jury, do you think the court then can, in the exercise and supervisory power, dismiss?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="207.877" stopTime="232.814">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="207.877" offset="973865">--I think it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.259" offset="979403">I think it does need to take the issue through a harmless error analysis to determine whether in fact, under the rules of this Court as articulated in Nova Scotia, that that was harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.488" offset="1036350">There are other mechanisms.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.616" offset="1040843">In short, if there's been wrongdoing of that kind, it may very well be difficult to establish that it was harmless error, but the court is--</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="246.743" offset="1129346">The Government has no quarrel, Mr. Chief Justice, with the holdings of a number of lower Federal courts that have concluded that the integrity of the grand jury would be compromised if the prosecutor knowingly uses material... I would insert the word material... perjurious testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.344" offset="1207713">That is to say, we then at that point lack confidence in exactly what the grand jury was doing.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="273.389" offset="1235926">And so that would be open to try... that would be open to a contested hearing as to whether the prosecutor did in fact use perjurious testimony?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="279.975" stopTime="302.699">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="279.975" offset="1262257">It has been, and the system has not suffered as a result of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.815" offset="1277617">That, we view it, as being... although this Court has not spoken directly to it... the law in any number of circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.532" offset="1308546">The new rule that the Tenth Circuit has now imposed would have enormous costs as well as view the grand jury in a very different light.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="302.699" offset="1353163">But just before we leave this point where you admit or concede, I think, but there is some room for court intervention if there is flagrant misconduct, use of perjurious testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.818" offset="1409692">But what is the reason why the indictment should be dismissed?</text>
            <text syncTime="322.631" offset="1432889">Because the grand jury right has not been accorded to the petitioner?</text>
            <text syncTime="326.895" offset="1449921">Or because we have the duty to supervise the Government in the prosecution of its cases?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_w_starr" startTime="333.130" stopTime="401.204">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="333.130" offset="1474894">Certainly not the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.379" offset="1479909">We do believe, with all respect, that while action can be taken with respect to a particular prosecutor for conduct before the court in a particular case, we do have difficulty with a broad use of the idea of supervisory power to tell the prosecutor how do discharge his obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.803" offset="1557650">If I may now return to what our reason would be for saying, yes, there is a problem in that grand jury testimony because essentially the nest has been befouled.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.119" offset="1606864">It has been befouled by the knowing use of testimony that is perjurious, and the grand jury may very well have acted on the basis of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.306" offset="1643645">In contrast, as Blackstone, as we note in footnote 3, Blackstone noted at common law it was unheard of to be adducing defenses before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.593" offset="1692755">That's not what grand juries are charged with doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.465" offset="1704249">They're not there to evaluation culpability in the sense of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.959" offset="1722221">They are simply there to make a determination of whether there is probable cause and not to evaluate defenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.545" offset="1764540">I use that to make the point that courts have been concerned about the integrity of the grand jury's function that is compromised in terms of the independence of the grand jury's judgement, if that judgment has been influenced materially by evidence that is perjurious or manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.641" offset="1860984">It goes to the idea of the integrity and independence of the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.909" offset="5430042">I think at the outset it's important to note the departmental policy of requiring the submission by prosecutors to the grand jury of substantial exculpatory evidence, which has been in effect for approximately 13 years, if my computation is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.687" offset="5545085">And we've operated under that in this justice system, and the Government has operated under that as an internal policy for that period of time, without it wrecking havoc on the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.845" offset="5593777">So we have here a rather unique situation, whereby actually the Government has followed, apparently, their policy of submitting this evidence to the grand juries.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.132" offset="5694923">No, Your Honor, but I'm addressing again the argument or position that was made by counsel relative to the difficulty that would be incurred in the Government determining what was exculpatory and presenting it to the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.003" offset="5762424">I think I understand that, but I thought another part of counsel's argument, which there's no need for you to address unless you want to, is that this rule would generate a number of... contested motions to dismiss in the district court, which do not exist simply with the departmental policy in place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.366" offset="5835880">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.448" offset="5840164">In regard to that aspect of the argument, the Government, under its Brady obligation at the commencement of the proceedings after the indictment, is going to have to marshal its exculpatory evidence in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.200" offset="5911217">They're going to have to know what is exculpatory at that point in time, because they're going to have, assuming an indictment is returned, a Brady obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.555" offset="5948624">So subsequently from the viewpoint again of the difficulty of submitting it and knowing what it is, it's going to have to be placed in the hands of the defendant at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.163" offset="6003064">Now, as far as there being a rash of motions in regard to this proceeding, I think over the past... as cited in the reply brief of the Government, over the past 10 years, there have been fewer than 10 cases that ultimately a dismissal has resulted on some such basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.502" offset="6224373">No, Your Honor, because again that would not be a statistic gathered by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.786" offset="6249555">I might point out, because there was some question also earlier, in terms of the cumbersome nature of the five volumes of the testimony that were obtained from a parallel bankruptcy proceeding, sometimes, when we're talking about situations involving financial institutions and the element of intent, particularly when it gets to a situation of whether a bank was misled under 18 U.S.C. 1014, the idea gets to be... well, this is such a vague situation, how's anyone going to know whether this is actually exculpatory and goes to that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.992" offset="6426352">In regard to this particular case, the trial court was quite specific, referring not only to specific items that were explained by the transcript of the testimony that went to the exact issue, the same transcript that was not given to the grand jury, the same transcript that in great detail, in five volumes, explained why the balance sheet and income statement was correct and why the defendant believed it was correct, his beliefs concerning the asset values that he placed on the assets that were the subject of the financial statements, and a very thorough discussion in this particular situation of the venture capital investments that this particular defendant had made and why he believed the numbers that he placed on those venture capital investments were accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.186" offset="6683083">So we have here a situation where not only are there documents that are explained, but we have a lengthy explanation by the defendant as to why he felt and why he believed that his financial statements were accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.016" offset="6750479">So even though this be, again, a case involving a bank violation, it is a case whereby the exculpatory nature of it is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.065" offset="6806695">And it was not submitted, of course, to the grand jury, which very well could have reviewed the five volumes and determined that this man really felt that these values were the values that were correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.924" offset="10890051">But there seems to be two different things we're speaking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.407" offset="10899978">One is the issue of the standard before the grand jury as far as the proof and regard to probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.869" offset="10925891">And another seems to be the issue of what the definition of substantial exculpatory evidence is, and whether that should be submitted to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.964" offset="10962254">That is, what... when is the evidence... the... when does the exculpatory evidence reach a point of becoming substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.590" offset="10996736">Which seems to be, again, two different, almost an apples-and-oranges analysis in the sense that one has to do with when the evidence has to be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.416" offset="11032053">The other has to do with what the standard is in regard to the grand jury and in regard to this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.692" offset="11053160">So, I may have misunderstood the question, but there seems to be two different analyses involved in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.237" offset="11079387">The... in this particular case, and I want to emphasize the difference in what the grand jury is today and get back on a point I made a minute ago in regard to what it was some years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.129" offset="11158904">Today, the grand jury relies 100 percent, in reality, on the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.192" offset="11187116">In times past, grand juries were members of the community, they had a good deal of knowledge of what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.156" offset="11211044">Today, that's simply not the case, as certain... certainly experience would tell us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.062" offset="11238629">Today, the grand jury is the recipient of evidence subpoenaed, obtained, acquired by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.306" offset="11279589">They have literally no independent source of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.403" offset="11311981">The agencies collect the evidence by either investigation or subpoena, and they're provided to the grand jury through the offices of the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.632" offset="11360882">The grand jury then looks at the evidence and makes a determination as far as the indictment is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.084" offset="11386691">But the law in all of the cases are clear that in order to make a decision, that the grand jury must be fully informed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.771" offset="11433503">They must in all instances, whether they receive the evidence... excuse me... whether they receive the evidence that might not be admissible in court, whether they receive the evidence that's substantial exculpatory evidence, the policy is to get before the grand jury all possible evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.495" offset="11508318">And this rule that was laid down by the Tenth Circuit would effectuate the same policy as I mentioned a moment ago of getting before the grand jury all possible evidence relative to the particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2987.961" offset="12094192">Thank you, Mr. Lang.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.183" offset="12103073">General Starr, you have 8 minutes remaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.714" offset="12113209">Mr. Starr, could I ask you a question before you start?</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.136" offset="12126897">In your brief, you state that internal Department of Justice policies are sufficient to compel prosecutors to disclose substantial known exculpatory evidence to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.626" offset="12188860">Was anything along that line done in this case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="3014.860" offset="12201816">Yes, it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.984" offset="12210280">Two individuals were called before the grand jury to testify about the joint venture investments in which Mr. Williams had invested very heavily and in which he, according to his bankruptcy testimony, had confidence, into the efficacy of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.568" offset="12304634">I won't characterize the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.379" offset="12319890">This is obviously protected by grand jury secrecy, but this is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.713" offset="12337235">Secondly, he... the United States Attorney who personally conducted this grand jury investigation, called before the grand jury two representatives from the accounting firm, the in-house accounting firm that handles the Williams' family accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.396" offset="12411945">And in fact, that had been suggested that that be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.288" offset="12427514">And so they testified with respect to what the accounting techniques were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.152" offset="12446949">I commend that testimony as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.793" offset="12457607">What was also before the grand jury here was a criminal referral from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and statements by a number of bank officers, who testified not only about his financial statements, and how... and I don't think there's any dispute here that the financial statements do not conform to GAP.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.579" offset="12556664">But more than that, what he was saying to the bank presidents when he was seeking these loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.076" offset="12590727">The grand jury had a very full picture before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.828" offset="12609744">With respect to the bankruptcy proceeding, transcript itself, that is classic hearsay, self-serving testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.335" offset="12655720">It was not subject, by definition, to cross-examination by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.598" offset="12676827">And frankly, although I'm sensitive to revealing anything before the grand jury, I think that a review of the grand jury transcript will satisfy the Court in this case that the grand jury had before it the fact that Mr. Williams had the sense of optimism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.250" offset="12747358">In fact, the United States Attorney put before the grand jury testimony about his character, his character in a very positive sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.317" offset="12787691">The United States Attorney did not seek to cut this off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.840" offset="12801797">When witnesses would say, I wish we could have done better with these investments, he didn't cut him off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.883" offset="12829904">The grand jury transcript shows a very moral prosecution conducted with integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.809" offset="12857594">With respect to the rule, now, that is being urged upon this Court, the Department of Justice policy speaks in terms of substantial evidence that directly negates guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.950" offset="12930215">For starters, that's not the Tenth Circuit's standard, either at Page or in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.573" offset="12952680">Secondly--</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.644" offset="12960935">Well, are you suggesting that it be all right to have a rule, a supervisory rule, that just tracks your manual?</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.343" offset="13011717">And that brings me to my second point, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.855" offset="13021852">That is Department of Justice policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.767" offset="13033451">It has historically been the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.817" offset="13041705">It is not, however, legal error.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.699" offset="13053199">Suppose there's a motion to dismiss the indictment, and the allegation is that the Government had in its... had in its possession information that it knew would necessarily bar an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.880" offset="13109937">For instance, they knew that this person was a minor and couldn't... just couldn't be indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.184" offset="13147136">And they just withheld it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.908" offset="13158002">And they were going to withhold it all though the trial, apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.389" offset="13167929">But there's a motion that says... and there's a... do you suppose that the district court should just dismiss the motion?</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.008" offset="13214427">I have no power to do anything about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.879" offset="13225921">I guess you would.</text>

            <text syncTime="3271.809" offset="13229578">Well, he has power to do something about it, but he should not dismiss the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.660" offset="13241072">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.011" offset="13242430">Even under those circumstances, if there was not flagrant misconduct in the use of perjurious testimony and the like, then no.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.907" offset="13289973">But again, what is being urged here is a rule that goes against what is a pathological case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.552" offset="13316618">To trap that pathological prosecutor, what the Tenth Circuit is urging essentially upon the system is a very costly rule when the incentives are entirely to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3304.559" offset="13360608">Well, that may be true, but there may be a valid narrow... much narrower rule than the Tenth Circuit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="3313.486" offset="13396344">But there are also narrower remedies than dismissal of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.539" offset="13412540">If there is in fact a bad apple in the prosecutorial barrel, there is hardly anything more effective than sanctioning that attorney for contempt of court, for singling him out, or her out, for criticism in a published opinion, which again, this Court has emphasized as a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.923" offset="13498117">That is a powerful remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.184" offset="13507103">It is not easy simply to go back to the grand jury, Justice White, as my colleague has suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.659" offset="13533016">These issues, by the way, arise in white collar crime cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.651" offset="13549003">They don't arise in other kinds of cases, typically, where the issue is intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.334" offset="13571678">These are complicated proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.628" offset="13580873">These financial fraud investigations are enormously complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.458" offset="13596233">You don't simply go back at almost zero cost and get an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.612" offset="13616817">You've got to present this elaborate case once again.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.058" offset="13658613">This prosecution can go forward because this case still lives and the statute is tolled while this issue is being litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.525" offset="13696438">But again, one of the things in terms of the presentation before the district court is the district court did not have the benefit of testimony of bank presidents who will talk about oral representations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.303" offset="13751609">That's a part of this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.544" offset="13760595">And that has not been before the district court at all.</text>
