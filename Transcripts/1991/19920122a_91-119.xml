            <text syncTime="20.913" offset="230059">The question presented in this case is whether for the 6-year period at issue the respondent engaged in activities other than those expressly permitted by Public Law 86-272, thereby forfeiting the limited immunity from State taxation measured by income, which is accorded by that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.593" offset="320756">It is Wisconsin's position that the respondent did engage in activities other than those expressly permitted, that its assessment covering that period is valid, and that the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court should therefore be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.122" offset="382927">This case arose as a result of a franchise tax assessment made by the Wisconsin Department of Revenue against the William Wrigley, Jr., Company, which is the largest manufacturer of chewing gum in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.898" offset="446039">The franchise tax is a fairly apportioned tax imposed only upon income attributable to business activities within Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.837" offset="485745">During these years, Wrigley's Wisconsin sales ranged from $2.8 million to $4.4 million, while its total sales ranged from $140 million to $230 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.782" offset="553559">The tax itself, exclusive of interest, is slightly in excess of $120,000, an amount which is not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.054" offset="594624">The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed the Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission solely on the legal question of how it construed the provisions of Public Law 86-272, and agreed with the construction of that statute that Wrigley continues to advocate here.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.020" offset="682500">This Court's decision in Heublein established two firm tenets for construing Public Law 86-272.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.376" offset="723878">First, Congress must speak clearly when it chooses to abridge the State's taxing powers, which of course are fundamental to their very existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.231" offset="767345">If Congress does not speak clearly, ambiguous terms in the statute will be construed in favor of the preexisting authority to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.122" offset="806947">Second, clarity that would remove uncertainty was Congress' primary goal in enacting Public Law 86-272.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.728" offset="845295">While any of the activities listed by the Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission would probably be sufficient to support taxation under the principles set forth by the Court in Heublein, the major activities engaged in by Wrigley, which we claim exceeded those listed in the statute, are maintaining stocks of goods in rented warehouse space in Wisconsin and in its employees' homes in Wisconsin; replacing stale or damaged product from that stock of goods; direct agency stock check sales and direct delivery of product from that stock of goods; and personnel management and similar activities engaged in by Wrigley's resident regional manager, which did not involve any customer participation.</text>

            <label>Mr. F. Thomas Creeron, III</label>
            <text syncTime="357.247" offset="1575365">Yes, the record clearly reflects that the regional manager in 1973 obtained permission from Wrigley to rent the warehouse, and was assured by Wrigley that he would in fact be reimbursed for those warehouse costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.024" offset="1642552">Then when an employee was finally hired and the... he lived in an apartment, the stock of gum would not fit within his apartment, he continued that arrangement, and he also was assured by Wrigley that he would be reimbursed for those costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.885" offset="1705977">So I don't think Wrigley can say that it did not approve of this particular activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.205" offset="1731264">Once the gum was in these in-State locations, Wrigley's sales representatives would use that gum, travel around to dealer locations, and would fill display stands at the retailer's location.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.534" offset="1816527">If the retailer did not have the correct sizes of product, the sales representative would swap product with the retailer, and place the different sizes of product in the display stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.580" offset="1884759">It's our position that that activity constituted delivery of goods from within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.167" offset="1911091">On occasion, approximately once per month per sales representatives, the retailer would not have the correct size of product, the sales representative could not do the necessary product swapping, and the sales representative would then provide gum to the retailer through a device known as an agency stock check.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.401" offset="2024044">The way that would work was that the stock check would be given to the retailer as a receipt, the wholesaler would bill the retailer, and Wrigley would then bill the wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.179" offset="2087156">Since billing did occur in these situations, it's our position that a sale did take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.667" offset="2113069">Therefore, both approval and delivery of these agency stock check transactions occurred in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.022" offset="2150477">The plain and unambiguous meaning of the statutory terminology prohibits this product swapping and these agency stock check transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.830" offset="2193736">The statute does permit certain business activity within a State that would otherwise have jurisdiction to tax, but its language immediately limits the phrase "business activity" in such a way that the only activity of that kind that may originate within the State must constitute solicitation of orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.712" offset="2297285">The plain and unambiguous meaning of the term "only" is that nothing else may occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.551" offset="2328632">And the Wisconsin Supreme Court's decision, with which Wrigley appears to agree in every respect, holds that the ordinary and accepted meaning of the term "solicit" is to make a plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.061" offset="2386624">The ordinary and accepted meaning of the term "solicitation of orders" therefore, is simply requesting orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.433" offset="2420165">Even if solicitation were determined to be an ambiguous term, its possible meanings can be placed on a spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.474" offset="2464260">At one end, simply requesting and receiving orders within the State would be permissible, and any other activity would result in payment of a fairly apportioned tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.830" offset="2509713">At the other end of that spectrum, lease or ownership of physical facilities or the presence of a stock of goods would be prohibited, and every other activity conducted within a State which would otherwise have jurisdiction to tax, would nevertheless be tax exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.910" offset="2582020">Every presumption in Heublein is in favor of that end of the spectrum, where only requesting orders is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.100" offset="2618800">Under the Court's decision in that case, Wrigley's burden to establish that the court should move away from that end of the spectrum any distance at all is enormous.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.157" offset="2667074">Yet Wrigley's redefinition of the term "solicitation" to include what it claims are incidental activities is at the exact opposite end of the spectrum from its ordinary and accepted meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.624" offset="7456887">I touch on that because we were making obviously an honest effort to comply with this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.926" offset="7478098">Now, General Creeron has focused on the word "solicitation", but I would remind you that that's not what that statute talks about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.682" offset="7505161">The statute talks about business activities within the State, which are the solicitation of orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.418" offset="7532119">It's the business activities that we're trying to determine the meaning of here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.637" offset="7548942">I would further point out that he said that this statute abridged the State's taxing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.012" offset="7586454">In fact, this statute is an allocation statute, because what you have here is all of Wrigley's orders or business in Wisconsin is presently taxed in Illinois... 100 percent of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.938" offset="7654163">So what this statute does is say that that is where it should be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.426" offset="7676106">On the other hand, if Wisconsin was going to tax some of these activities, then under the so-called reverse nexus rule, Illinois would not tax so... those particular activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.768" offset="7729500">So this doesn't take power away from the States to tax, what it does is to allocate power between the States that can tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.098" offset="7814764">And in fact I... we don't contest that there's nexus in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1923.969" offset="7842245">We would concede immediately that there's nexus to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.620" offset="7852903">What I meant by that was it isn't as if it was telling the States you cannot tax this activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.357" offset="7879861">What it is is saying that Illinois can tax it, but Wisconsin can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.345" offset="7899819">It allocates that power between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.528" offset="7908491">Now, General Creeron, if I understood him, in answer to a question from Justice Souter, conceded that dropping off posters would be part of the business activities that was covered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.855" offset="7961886">And he said because that's inextricably bound up in the solicitation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.092" offset="7986754">That is our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.377" offset="7995949">That is our position, that everything that we did was either inextricably bound up in the solicitation process or it was of a de minimis nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="3014.565" offset="12204694">If you look on page 2 of his reply brief, something that I had noticed before in his main brief, he says that you don't have to have a sale in order for you to be covered under the pre-sale/post-sale test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.992" offset="12262372">Now if that's true, it seems to me we fit his test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.312" offset="12279613">If you don't have to have a sale, and all you have to do is the activities that would lead up to a sale, or if you have a sale, then you keep going to try to get the next sale, why, I think we meet the pre-sale/post-sale test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.036" offset="12334575">Or to put it another way, I don't thing the so-called pre-sale/post-sale test makes any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.107" offset="12358816">Because certainly in the gum industry, and Justice Blackmun, you put your finger on it, was that you not only have a short shelf life, but you have, you know, 95 percent of it is impulse buying... 95 percent is impulse buying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.520" offset="12452544">And so you... when you put those two together, what you have there is activity that is ongoing in every sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.715" offset="13609246">On the de minimis exemption, the word "only" is what gives the statute its character protecting small business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.635" offset="13640906">If you make $600 of sales, and you say that's de minimis, a small business who comes into the State and makes that same $600 of sales, and it's their total sales, loses out under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.129" offset="13694927">That's totally at odds with the statutory purpose of protecting small business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.699" offset="13713213">The de minimis exemption also hasn't been defined in any way--</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.735" offset="13729305">I don't know if I understand that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.951" offset="13734216">Because a small business could make de minimis mistakes, too, and be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.805" offset="13749680">I mean, a small business isn't one that has only $600 of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.757" offset="13765458">That can have a couple hundred thousand and still be a small business.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3409.244" offset="13783430">What I'm saying is if there's a de minimis exception, the small business will get the benefit of it as much as the big business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.814" offset="13813628">--But how do you determine what the de minimis exemption is?</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.599" offset="13828779">I mean, they have no definition--</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3422.082" offset="13834735">Well, that's another problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.582" offset="13836720">But I just don't buy your argument that it's loaded one way or another based on the size of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.253" offset="13855424">At least I don't understand it on that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.122" offset="13870888">--But I mean, a small business couldn't claim a de minimis exemption if all its $600 of sales involve direct delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.893" offset="13897951">You know I... it seems to me that that removes the character of the statute of protecting small business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.047" offset="13926581">Also, the statute was designed to protect those corporations that couldn't afford attorneys and accountants to examine the tax laws of other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.872" offset="13977886">I think there's a certain irony in this case, if you just look at the front of Wrigley's brief, that they're claiming the benefit of the statute in light of the great number of able counsel that they're able to employ.</text>
