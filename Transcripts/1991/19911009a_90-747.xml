            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="57.670" offset="375947">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.525" offset="415340">This case arises under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.012" offset="429341">Under exemption 6 of the act, which relates to private information and Government records, this Court has twice concluded that it is unquestionably appropriate to redact private names from Government documents produced under the act, for private names reveal nothing about how Government conducts its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.324" offset="510634">In this case, however, the Eleventh Circuit has concluded that private names in confidential State Department interviews conducted in Haiti in the early 1980's should be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.483" offset="563193">The purpose of these interviews was to monitor Haitian compliance with its then recent undertaking to not harass or mistreat Haitians who are intercepted on the ocean seas by U.S. vessels and return to Haitian ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.295" offset="634455">After they were returned, certain interviewees were randomly approached by representatives of the Department of State in Haiti.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.717" offset="668205">They were assured confidential discussions, and based upon those assurances, frank disclosure of the personal treatment that each interviewee received by the Haitian Government, as well as intimate personal information and descriptions of domestic conditions in Haiti, were obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.214" offset="750125">Out of the hundreds of interviews that were conducted, there was only one confirmed case where a Haitian who had been returned by U.S. vessels had been mistreated by its Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.688" offset="795996">When respondents sought copies of these documents under the Freedom of Information Act, the State Department made them available.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.378" offset="834762">But in accordance with the practice approved by this Court in Rose and Reporters Committee, redacted the private names from the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.484" offset="871229">The names of the Government officers who conducted the interviews are revealed on the documents and were not redacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.137" offset="897874">The court of appeals applied a generalized balancing test that compared the public interest in disclosure with the private interest in privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.361" offset="942700">The court's--</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="200.445" offset="947088">Are you urging the abandonment of the balancing test?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="203.730" offset="960254">--There are applications for the balancing test that we still of course recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.717" offset="988153">We think that there is nonetheless a workable rule that Congress adopted under exemption 6 that doesn't require an ad hoc balancing in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.692" offset="1036009">The legislative history, though, the Senate and House reports under exemption 6 made clear that Congress didn't intend that the choice would simply be between full disclosure and nondisclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.117" offset="1093792">The Senate report specifically says that what was intended was what was described as responsible disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.188" offset="1118034">And the report gives specific content to that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.057" offset="1133498">The Senate report indicates that in balancing the public and private interests, what is to be accomplished is an accommodation of the two interests under which, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="258.615" offset="1179787">"neither is abrogated or substantially subordinated. "</text>
            <text syncTime="262.650" offset="1195878">So the basic thrust of exemption 6, the primary inquiry, is how do you protect both interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.153" offset="1225867">The statutory mechanism that Congress provided for this is the last sentence of Section 552(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="278.076" offset="1257632">It specifically provides that exempt information can be redacted, but governmental public data can be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.265" offset="1290337">Under exemption 6, we submit that this provision is not simply an available tool, but it is an essential feature of the mutual accommodation of public and private interests that Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.323" offset="1342582">It allows redaction to protect the privacy of the individuals, but it allows disclosure to present Government facts under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.345" offset="1382706">In fact, the House report at page 11 specifically contemplated this result in providing that individualized identifying information should not be disclosed but underlying facts and compilations of statistical information should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.020" offset="1445400">We submit this is the workable rule that Congress intended under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.258" offset="1466298">Now, Your Honor, I... in describing this as a workable rule, it may be simply a quibble, but I do want to suggest that I see a distinction in the Court's cases between workable rules and what this Court has described as categorical rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.034" offset="1533380">A workable rule is one that the Court construes as being the intended result that Congress had when it adopted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.874" offset="1564832">A categorical rule has been adopted by this Court in situations where there is room for judgment left in... for the Court to make an empirical judgment about whether cases will ordinarily or most frequently properly be decided under the statute in one direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.585" offset="1639647">We think this is a workable rule that Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.870" offset="1652812">There is ample evidence of that intent.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="379.553" offset="1663470">Your view is that what you describe as a categorical view... rule is not a workable rule?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kent_l_jones" startTime="386.207" stopTime="457.017">
            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="386.207" offset="1690115">Well, I don't want to belabor the point, but as I understand the Court's decision, for example, in Reporters Committee, which of course wasn't a redaction case, it was a disclosure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.598" offset="1739643">The question was whether the document should be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.632" offset="1747794">So there wasn't this... the workable rule that we proposed wouldn't have worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.918" offset="1764930">But when the Court adopted a categorical rule in Reporters Committee, it was making a prudential judgment that the interests that Congress intended to protect were sufficiently great in the most similar cases, so... and that the public interest in disclosure in that instance was sufficiently low that as a categorical rule, all rap sheets would be subject to nondisclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.486" offset="1871196">Now that's a harder case than we have because we're not talking about nondisclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.556" offset="1895542">We had disclosed these reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.406" offset="1902961">What we're talking about is simply the identifying information.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.709" offset="1920097">And in the context of identifying information, the legislative history is quite clear that what was intended to be allowed was production of facts, protection of individual identities.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.017" offset="1973387">Were there... aren't there situations such as the names or donors or participants from governmental contracts that might well be revealed to the benefit of the country?</text>

            <text syncTime="475.479" offset="2047157">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.014" offset="2053322">In fact, our understanding of the workable rule that we think Congress intended is also elaborated by the fact that in the House report at page 6, there are only two examples given of when names would be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.356" offset="2110687">Those two examples are Government employees and their duty stations, and Government officers voting on official orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.581" offset="2159588">In those situations, the names of the individuals directly show how Government conducts its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.985" offset="2185188">By parallel reasoning, the name of a person who is doing the Government's business would also show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.091" offset="2217684">A Government contractor, a person operating under a Government grant... these are people who are doing the Government's business even though they are still private.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.613" offset="2255718">And we think that in those instances there would be a public interest in disclosure of the names.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.716" offset="2372120">--I'm not aware of an inconsistency, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.335" offset="2390615">Respondents seem to acknowledge that there is such a general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.106" offset="2421753">They concede that Congress intended that the redaction of private names would occur in what they describe as the majority of cases, at page 27 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.498" offset="2463235">They suggest, however, that there is some exception to the general rule of redaction that should apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.152" offset="2489880">They claim that the case is outside the normal rule, solely because they can use the names of these individuals to track them down in Haiti, reinterview them, and based upon those additional interviews, determine or form a judgment about whether the Government's initial interview reports are truthful and accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.398" offset="2574830">And based upon this sole justification, they believe disclosure is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.319" offset="2602520">There is no basis in the record in this case for any assertion that the Government's interview reports are not truthful or accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.027" offset="2645361">They are... as the Court can determine by inspecting them, simply recite conversations that occurred in confidence in Haiti.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.799" offset="2684440">The names are the only thing that have been redacted from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.787" offset="2700427">They describe details that flow from conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.989" offset="2721220">There is little in the way of interpretative remarks, not to say there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.825" offset="2744626">But there is no basis for a suggestion that these documents are not truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.248" offset="2774301">Notwithstanding the lack of a basis, respondents claim disclosure should occur so they could find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.854" offset="2808678">Well, there is no limit to that sort of unworkable proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.008" offset="2829367">The names in veterans' hospital records, Government employee records, cadet disciplinary reports as in Rose, rap sheets as in Reporters Committee... all contain names of individuals that theoretically one could go to to inquire... to find out if the Government's records are truthful or accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.171" offset="2917975">This is a sweeping interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.039" offset="2929469">It is truly an exception that would swallow the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.658" offset="2943888">And I want to emphasize in that regard that the rule that we're... that we do think exists here would be swallowed by a contention that in every case we can find out if it's truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.085" offset="3005642">Because the purpose of the rule is not simply to reach a result, but it's to reach a workable result in a manner that Congress intended without ad hoc balancing in every instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.094" offset="3053707">This Court has noted the legislative history is replete with references by Congress that they desired to avoid ad hoc balancing and desired to conduct the FOIA under workable rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.235" offset="3106265">Since the Eleventh Circuit decision in this case, the Second and the Third Circuits have already had occasion to consider this exact proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.191" offset="3146076">In the Hopkins case, the Second Circuit rejected the respondent's claim as too attenuated to be a basis for ad hoc balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.999" offset="3185260">The Third Circuit agreed with the Hopkins decision in FLRA v. The Navy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.045" offset="6313475">The preliminary question in a (b)(6) balancing test is, is the privacy interests, if any at stake, a substantial privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.984" offset="6353181">So I would like to take a second to look at the text of the actual reports in this case so we can see exactly how private these interviews were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.673" offset="6391947">And I submit to you that these interviews were not private but that they were totally public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.266" offset="6762363">This I submit shows a totally different picture from what the Government claims at page 7 in their reply brief, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.871" offset="6796740">"The inherently sensitive nature of the State Department's efforts to monitor human rights practices at Haiti provides undeniable justification for conducting these interviews in confidence. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.929" offset="6845015">These interviews were not conducted in confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.964" offset="6857136">They were conducted out and open on the streets of these little villages and hamlets and mud-thatched houses where many, many people in those towns knew what was going on and knew who these people were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.539" offset="6907395">It's also evident from the record that people in these villages knew who these people were when they left Haiti and when they came back and when they were interviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.460" offset="6947101">So I would submit that the privacy interests at stake in this case is as the district court found, de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.983" offset="6977194">However, assuming that this Court finds that there is significant or substantial privacy interests, then I believe that this Court, in applying the balancing test, would certainly find that the public interest in disclosure far outweighs any privacy interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.179" offset="7462027">And the specific uses in this case which the Government uses that information, these reports, are for... what they have done already is they have interdicted 22,000 Haitians on the high seas, and they have used these reports specifically to send those people back to their country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.807" offset="7532558">They have used these reports to create advisory opinions in every Haitian's asylum claim in all the immigration courts throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.346" offset="7570696">And they are still doing that today in 1991.</text>

            <text syncTime="1867.720" offset="7616149">However, as State Department official Eaves swore to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.624" offset="7639764">This information, he said, was old and outdated and of no value to an asylum claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.326" offset="7658572">I believe here this information that we request has been used in such public fashion that the public interest is so heightened above just any request whatsoever to monitor some Government conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.538" offset="7723460">Here this information is used daily in the courts, the Federal courts, in the immigration courts, in advisory opinion, to send Haitians back to their country, to deport them, to deny their asylum claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.713" offset="7784169">So that I believe is the... are the factors that the Eleventh Circuit use in their balance to conclude that the public interests outweighed any privacy interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.594" offset="9091650">So the issue, I think, which that shows is that the Government is really trying to argue is not to protect confidentiality and privacy, but rather to protect their own confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.937" offset="9152985">And the Freedom of Information Act only is designed to protect individual privacy, and not Government privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.840" offset="9180675">I think it is important to point out also that the only evidence in the record to show the privacy interests at stake here are the declarations of three State Department employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.267" offset="9234383">And the first one by a Mr. Eaves specifically states that the release of the requested information in this case would cause possible embarrassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.723" offset="9276179">Would cause possible embarrassment does not meet the burden of proof under Exemption (b)(6) which requires what would result would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.633" offset="9327797">The other two affidavits submitted do not even talk at all about personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.619" offset="9355800">They only address issues of foreign policy and national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.254" offset="9378265">And as this Court has already ruled, those issues are no longer before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.991" offset="9393207">So even by the own Government's evidence presented in this case, they have not meant their burden of showing that the privacy interests, if any in this case, would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2340.559" offset="9507519">Well, I think it's very important in the context of the Freedom of Information Act, especially because in the past, the Government has gone before Congress and has unsuccessfully attempted to have Congress write out the (b)(6) exemption requirement and to allow the Government to only have to show that a privacy interest could be infringed upon, rather than that it would be or clearly would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.460" offset="9615144">And they were unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.228" offset="9622249">And therefore, as this Court recognized in the Reporters Committee, there is a very distinct difference between Exemption 7(C) and (b)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.018" offset="9657358">So I think in this context you have to look specifically at what the Government has proffered for their argument as to why they have met the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.956" offset="9693093">And they haven't met it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.056" offset="9697482">It's just simply not met.</text>

            <text syncTime="2430.282" offset="9866442">That there's a different test for the two?</text>

            <text syncTime="2434.817" offset="9884518">I think in each case, you perform the balancing test after you determine that there is a privacy interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.971" offset="9909178">You then look to see if there's a public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.589" offset="9919627">And you weigh and consider the two and decide which one outweighs the other, no matter whether it's a hole document or part of a document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.010" offset="9949302">However, I do know that if a part of a document can be segregated... it's nondisclosable... then the Government has the duty to do that and disclose the part that is segregable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.467" offset="9991202">And this Court has recognized also what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.752" offset="10008339">Many of the Justices here have recognized in prior decisions that unless Congress under the Freedom of Information Act has created a specific exemption, that this Court will not read one into the law, which the Government is asking them to do today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.512" offset="10067376">Justice O'Connor recognized that in her dissent in the Abramson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.250" offset="10086288">Justice Scalia recognized that in his dissent in the John Doe case, as well as Justice Blackmun in his majority opinion in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.272" offset="10118367">So there is no categorical exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.723" offset="10132159">However, I would submit that even if this Court were to buy the Government's argument that there should be a new rule of derivative use, that we have met our burden of proof under that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.865" offset="10176776">Because contrary to the Government's assertion in its brief that the only information redacted here are the names, it is clear by looking at... and that's in the last page of the rely brief... it is clear by looking at the reports themselves that there are other factors, other information that has been deleted here as well, such as addresses and places where people lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.747" offset="10280326">Now, there is no indication from these reports that the Government ever went to any prisons to see if anyone were incarcerated as a result of having left their country illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.323" offset="10330585">If anyone were likely to have been persecuted, it would seem to me that the most likely place to look to find out whether they were persecuted or not, would be in a jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.631" offset="10383771">And in fact, Chief Judge James Lawrence King in the Southern District of Florida, in the case of HRC v. Civiletti, 503 F. Supp. 442, the Southern District of Florida in 1980, recognized specifically in that case there was much evidence presented of the State Department's manner of interviewing returnees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.977" offset="10469243">But the fact that the State Department did not check with prisons made their methods fatally inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.750" offset="10504247">And I would suggest that that's another factor here which shows why there is such a large public interest in obtaining these names, so that we can verify the fate of these returnees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2660.663" offset="10787937">We're just asked to take the Government at its word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.781" offset="10800371">The affidavit by I believe Mr. Melton of the State Department, when he says conditions have so changed in Haiti that these reports are no longer of any value, well, then why did the State Department stop following up and checking to find out what the fate of these returnees is?</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.958" offset="10865155">And since they don't know, then how can they send advisory opinions to the immigration courts today in 1991, like you'll see in the respondent's brief in appendix 1a saying that we know these people don't have any fear that they are going to be mistreated when they go back because we did interviews in 1982 and '83.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.087" offset="10937671">How would they know?</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.621" offset="10943731">It's just simply not possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.906" offset="10952927">So the Government has not done an effective follow-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.458" offset="10967137">We are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.392" offset="10970899">We are the follow-up program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.977" offset="10977168">We are the only way to determine whether these people's fate is as the Government states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.798" offset="11000469">And whether the Government is telling the truth or not, we certainly have cause to question that, and we certainly have the right under the Freedom of Information Act to find that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.404" offset="11038922">I would just state also that when the persons who are not promised not confidentiality aboard the interdicted vessels are brought back to Haiti, their names aren't protected in confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.019" offset="11133380">In fact, the record shows that when they are sent back to the dock in Haiti, their names are given on 11 lists to the Haitian authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.423" offset="11167026">And immediately after that, an embassy official sits in on interviews with these individuals with the Haitian police, the Haitian Red Cross, the Haitian military, and the Haitian executive department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.766" offset="11216345">I submit that that's further evidence that what the Government's interest here is is not interest in protecting the privacy of these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.372" offset="11254798">And also if it's true as the Government states that not one of these people... or I've heard now that perhaps there was one who was mistreated... if no one was mistreated, then why on earth would they be afraid to come forward and admit what they said previously?</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.000" offset="11325328">And not only that, they could always say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.118" offset="11337762">They don't have to talk to use if they don't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.654" offset="11347898">But all we're asking for is the same information that has already been given to the Haitian police and the Haitian military and the Haitian Red Cross and the Haitian executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.343" offset="11394709">We're asking for names that have already been given to the only people, if there are any, who likely would be persecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.116" offset="11421772">There is no means to verify this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.756" offset="11472345">There is no other avenue where we can go to find out by some other means whether this is true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.029" offset="11509439">The Government states in its brief that cooperation with the United States is not often liked and these people might be treated if the... oh, I'm sorry... if the Government finds out they spoke to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.753" offset="11556251">Well, again, I would just submit that if no one was mistreated as the Government says, then I would think the Government of Haiti would honor these people and praise them for being such positive supporters of the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2921.694" offset="11832104">One other important thing is that one of the documents released in this case, it's called a fact sheet, and it's for use as far as telling interviewers how to question these interviewees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.669" offset="11883931">And one of the things that it states in there is be sure and ask these people whether or not they have been treated by, quote, unquote, "the civilian militia".</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.309" offset="11926562">Now the Government has admitted in its brief that the Tonton Macoutes, the secret policy in Haiti, were at the time of Duvalier, the relevant time to this case, that they were the civilian enforcers of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.903" offset="11984868">So the interviewers have been instructed to specifically ask these people if they have been mistreated by the civilian enforcers of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.925" offset="12021021">This is in the fact sheet, the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.044" offset="12029485">However, if you look at the actual reports themselves, I believe I found in only one place any reflection that anybody was ever asked if they were mistreated by anyone other than government officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.803" offset="12088522">And that is another basis, I would submit, to show how unreliable these studies are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.557" offset="12115480">Because the people who are most likely to mistreat these individuals, if anyone, are the civilian enforcers of the law, as the Government has recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.813" offset="12152574">So there's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.932" offset="12161038">However, the Government... there's no evidence that they even bothered to ask these people if they were mistreated by these persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.419" offset="12190922">Yet they ask the Court to take their word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.871" offset="12204819">They ask the American public to take their word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.154" offset="12213909">And many, many of these documents show that a large scheme of the State Department is to disseminate these results to the public, to the media, even to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.528" offset="12255392">And these documents, if you look at them, specifically state that in great detail how they have a need to target audiences in Miami and Washington and in New York where there are many Haitians, in order to dispel the notion in their minds that when Haitians return to Haiti, they are going to be mistreated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.508" offset="12335327">And the same documents which state the Government's need to inform the people in these areas, state that they know that these conceptions are not true because the State Department has done these interviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.785" offset="12396453">Again, for all the reasons that I've submitted, these interviews are just not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.005" offset="12417351">And again, we don't have to prove the Government's wrong here, or that they are not telling the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.307" offset="12434487">We have just shown... I hope I have shown to you... how important these public interests are and how many questions there... that have been raised by the Government's own reports as to whether or not their conclusions really are true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.300" offset="12486523">It is true that... I don't remember the exact quote... something like, great nations like great men must be able to be taken at their word, and I believe that also applies to our State Department, because we are talking here not about one person's case or one person's right; we're talking about perhaps the fate of the 22,000 people who were stopped on the high seas who have been sent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.748" offset="12584326">And there is evidence that shows that they were sent back specifically because of these studies and the alleged results of these interviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.854" offset="12620688">The Government also claims in the reply brief, page 7, that they are afraid the authorities will get the names of these returnees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.198" offset="12682128">Well, they already have the names of the 22,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.650" offset="12691846">And I would submit that for all the reasons already shown about how public these interviews were, that it's no secret who these people were.</text>
