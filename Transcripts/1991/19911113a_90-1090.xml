            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text syncTime="42.360" offset="316121">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="45.533" offset="328869">The question presented in this case is whether the Attorney General has statutory authority to require an arrested alien, as a condition of his release on bond, to refrain from unauthorized employment pending a final determination of his deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.536" offset="404833">In 1983 the Attorney General promulgated the regulation challenged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.379" offset="428239">The operative two sentences read as follows; condition against unauthorized employment, a condition barring employment shall be included in an appearance and delivery bond in connection with the deportation proceeding or bond posted for the release of an alien in exclusion proceedings unless the district director determines that employment is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.066" offset="530952">The Ninth Circuit below held that the regulation exceeds the Attorney General's statutory authority under section 1252(a) of 8 USC.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.750" offset="569718">That section provides that the Attorney General may impose such, quote, such conditions as the Attorney General may prescribe, close quote, on release bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.009" offset="614753">The court of appeals principally reasoned that the Attorney General could not detain an alien for engaging in unauthorized employment and that a bond condition must therefore relate to insuring appearance for hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.920" offset="674416">We ask this Court to hold that the Attorney General's regulation is within his statutory authority for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.146" offset="703256">First, bond conditions may be used to further any of the purposes of the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.600" offset="729065">Second, protecting American workers from displacement by alien workers is a core purpose of those immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.686" offset="765427">And third, a bond condition against unauthorized employment helps protect American workers from displacement by aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.832" offset="805969">The text of section 1252(a) authorizes release of an alien on bond containing, quote, such conditions as the Attorney General may prescribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.631" offset="849228">Those conditions are not limited by the text of that section to any particular subset of the concerns of the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.015" offset="882769">As the Attorney General explained almost 20 years ago in his decision in Toscano Rivis, it would be unreasonable to construe the quoted language to mean that the Attorney General may impose bond conditions which are totally unrelated to the various purposes of the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.636" offset="949225">But the reports clearly demonstrate a congressional intent to grant wide discretion otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.870" offset="978168">In particular, section 1252(a)--</text>

            <text syncTime="213.576" offset="1000947">If the... and I know you disagree with this reading, but if the Ninth Circuit were correct that the regulation required that the bond condition be imposed even if the alien intended to do authorized work, would that regulation be valid, be authorized by the statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="241.303" offset="1111915">In other words, the Attorney General could decide that aliens in deportation proceeding who only are authorized by his regulation to work may lose that authorization if they are in deportation proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.324" offset="1235945">Now I would note, though, in that context that he has not applied the regulation in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.899" offset="1258305">And in fact, part 208 of 8 CFR specifically provides that any alien who files a nonfrivolous asylum petition shall be given work authorization pending the determination of that asylum application.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.698" offset="1477525">The determination whether an alien is authorized to work comes down to, is based on two facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.733" offset="1501662">First, whether the person arrested by the INS is, in fact, an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.114" offset="1519112">And we will usually know that from statements given to the arresting officer or travel documents found on the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.289" offset="1543876">They will say his country of birth and it won't be the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.551" offset="1556937">The second fact you need is whether that immigration, whether the immigration status held by the alien, if any, authorizes him to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.226" offset="1591628">That determination is made with, by reference to 8 CFR 274(a)(12).</text>
            <text syncTime="368.542" offset="1620885">It lists the 27 or 26 statuses that authorize an alien to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.518" offset="1648784">So the alien will even, either show his green card, will show some other document issued by the INS which the INS requires the alien to hold on his person, or will give the INS his A or application number, which again is cross-referenced to his immigration status.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.647" offset="1713254">And you can just read from the regulation whether that status entitles the alien to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.820" offset="1729972">So it is an informal hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.309" offset="1999974">In implementation of the employee/employer sanctions in IRCA, the alien is required to show the employer, actually anyone is required to show the employer, documents evidencing a right to work, either a green card or some combination of a couple of other forms of documentation, like a social security card and a driver's license.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.010" offset="2070714">The district director is essentially asking the alien to furnish the same sort of documentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.513" offset="2092761">And given that the alien is the one who would have that documentation or who would know his A number, it's reasonable to require him to provide that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.302" offset="2135915">I would note, though, that immediately after the arresting officer or the district director or his designate makes the determination, there is prompt administrative and judicial review as we outlined.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.820" offset="2189936">The form that the alien, that contains the bond, has a check-mark box so, which the alien, and the alien is required to sign the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.455" offset="2224523">And he has to check a box saying whether he wants a bond redetermination proceeding by an immigration judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.519" offset="2248764">Those bond redetermination proceedings are held very promptly in large cities with large alien populations.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.336" offset="2344059">And the statute also authorizes, gives the alien the right to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.461" offset="2380526">It is, and it's not the case that the alien will even have to wait in custody while the writ, while the litigation is going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.479" offset="2704653">But the general answer to your question, Justice O'Connor, is that it's not an additional ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.653" offset="2721267">I do note, though, that the statute, once we do have a ground for arresting an alien, the attorney, the statute, 1252(a), gives the Attorney General the authority in his discretion to retake an alien back into custody so that if, for example, an alien entering without inspection were found to have been engaged in unauthorized employment, the Attorney General would be entitled in that case, even without the regulation, to take the alien back.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.252" offset="2831713">What the regulation and the bond condition give us the authority to do is to hold the risk of forfeiture over the alien to encourage voluntary compliance with essentially a preexisting duty not to engage in work.</text>

            <text syncTime="799.716" offset="3345594">But a mere violation of the condition itself, you're exactly right, would not be a ground for deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.950" offset="3370462">Section 1252(a) simply cannot be read as the court of appeals did the first 2 times around and as the respondents read it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.177" offset="3407347">To be concerned solely with appearance, this Court in Carlson v. Landon rejected the contention that the predecessor to section 1252(a) was concerned only with appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.075" offset="3451024">The Sixth Circuit, which wrote one of the opinions under review in that case, held that the alien Communist there had to be released because the Attorney General's authority was limited to insuring appearance for deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.275" offset="3503791">This Court rejected that limiting construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.789" offset="3513822">It held that, and dismissed as of not great significance the factor of probable availability for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.113" offset="3543184">Once you are beyond the appearance limitation and, as this Court has held, can detain people for, who are security risks or can exercise the authority under 1252(a) to further the public interest, prevention of unauthorized employment and protection of the American labor force against displacement by aliens is clearly one of those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.560" offset="3648927">If respondent's contention were correct, it would mean that the Attorney General could not revoke bail or impose a condition on an alien who repeatedly engages in unauthorized employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="935.524" offset="3888836">That is an... it is important, though, that to note that although the Attorney General has had the authority given by section 1252(a) for 40 years and has gone on record as saying he has the authority for more than 20, he has exercised it in a very conservative and measured fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.236" offset="3967621">And has, in fact, the only condition that I am aware of that he has imposed beyond ensuring appearance is to prevent unauthorized employment, although he could certainly impose this standard condition, the standard mandatory condition that I just referenced with relation to people released before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.919" offset="4046407">The history of successive legislation is yet another reason why, that makes clear that Congress authorized bond conditions beyond those related to appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.667" offset="4093323">The Immigration Act of 1917 permitted release on bond, quote, conditioned that such alien shall be produced when required for a hearing or hearings in regard to the charge upon which he has been taken into custody, close quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.036" offset="4154867">Congress expanded the permissible bond conditions in the legislative history, they said they wanted to change that law in 1950 in the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.885" offset="4202201">The revised act, after repealing the 1917 law, specified that the appearance condition shall only be among the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.140" offset="4235220">And the legislative history which referenced H.R. 10 specified that the Attorney General shall have full discretion and untrammeled authority to impose conditions for bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.037" offset="4282867">Section 1252(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which is the Attorney General's current authority, followed the procedure established by the 1950 Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.665" offset="4325394">Once it is agreed that bond conditions and the Attorney General's authority in section 1252(a) can extend to any of the purposes of the immigration laws, it must extend to protecting American workers from displacement by aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.376" offset="4392163">Congress clearly intended to protect American workers from displacement by aliens not intended to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.600" offset="4417136">They did so in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.121" offset="4423197">The first way was described this Court in Sure-Tan as the principle of selectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.225" offset="4443572">Nonimmigrants can lawfully enter the United States only in, generally speaking, only in a status that does not authorize them to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.880" offset="4478263">And immigrants and the remainder of nonimmigrants can enter the United States in a status that authorizes them to work only if the Secretary of Labor has first certified that they will not take away jobs from American workers who are willing and able to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.040" offset="4542838">If there was any doubt on Congress' purpose in this regard it was resolved by the employers' sanctions enacted by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.919" offset="4586410">It prevents employers, the other half of this employment contract, from hiring the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.042" offset="4610861">Indeed, 8 USC 1324 defines unauthorized alien to mean an alien not a permanent, lawful resident or, quote, authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.940" offset="4662479">Thus, Congress has made it absolutely clear that unauthorized by work, unauthorized work by aliens is an evil that it wanted to prevent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1249.876" offset="5146162">It, there are not many public interests that are not part of the, a purpose of the immigration law, although, again, this case does not require the Court to plumb the depths of exactly how far that authority goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.686" offset="5205407">We're dealing here with authority that is at the very absolute core of the purposes of the immigration laws and was, before the Immigration Nationality Act and the contract labor legislation was, in the 1952 act, and was reaffirmed by Congress in the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.029" offset="5274789">A bond condition against unauthorized employment... actually, before I get to that, I should perhaps address the Ninth Circuit's rationale in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.984" offset="5314599">They concluded that the Attorney General's authority did not extend to detaining aliens for unauthorized employment, and by analogy that the bond condition could not be used for prevention of unauthorized employment almost entirely on the basis of IRCA's rejection of employee sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.688" offset="5397460">They had two basic rationales; that Carlson did not deal with unauthorized employment, which is true, but it still dealt with a nonappearance related restriction; and that IRCA rejected employee sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.549" offset="5460885">In that regard there are a number of points should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.563" offset="5472901">In IRCA, Congress can be said to reject at most a criminal sentence for unauthorized employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.057" offset="5502890">It did not reject prehearing detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.228" offset="5511563">In addition, there was, in fact, no legislative rejection of employee sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.612" offset="5533087">The reference that respondents make occurs in hearings on the Immigration Reform and Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.137" offset="5559210">And it was simply a Senator in colloquy with a testifying witness dismissing a witness' suggestion that that would be a good legislative proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.495" offset="5592647">There is no congressional act as a body rejecting the proposed amendment to the proposed IRCA legislation or amending IRCA to take out an employee sanction, nothing that would indicate that Congress felt it actually would be bad to use bond conditions or detention in the way the Attorney General might.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.331" offset="5688046">In addition, a surprising concession in the brief by respondents is that the Ninth... whatever authority IRCA provides or doesn't provide cannot affect the Attorney General's preexisting authority in prior legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.983" offset="5754606">That takes out the guts of the Ninth Circuit's decision, because whatever Congress did in 1986, it clearly did not impliedly repeal the Attorney General's authority under section 1252(a) to impose bond conditions to further the various purposes of the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.564" offset="5824927">With that, it's knowing that the Attorney General has the authority to further these immigration law purposes and that unauthorized employment, prevention of it, is at the core of those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.414" offset="5884382">It's important to note that the bond condition helps protect American workers from displacement by aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.738" offset="5909669">What it does, in fact, is provide an additional lever over aliens to encourage voluntary compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.602" offset="5933074">Aliens and their families often put up the money to post bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.074" offset="5946972">The risk of forfeiture is a very, very effective way of getting the aliens to comply with the bond condition and prevent the evil Congress identified of them working.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.374" offset="6000157">This additional enforcement measure is important, especially as the legislative history we cite in our brief, to those American workers with few job skills who live on the margin of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.162" offset="6047386">5 years after passage of IRCA, the INS is still arresting and charging with deportability almost 1 million aliens a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.068" offset="6082913">Although most of those aliens take a voluntary departure, more than 100,000 of them contested deportation hearings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.670" offset="6301401">First, it tells persons arrested by the INS and simply charged with being deportable... not yet found deportable, they've not yet had a hearing before the corps of immigration judges that the Attorney General hires precisely to determine whether they are deportable or not, it tells them that in order to exercise their right to a deportation hearing, they must go cold, hungry, and homeless.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.432" offset="6440372">As I understand it, it's not imposing a new disability from work upon them, it is simply requiring their commitment not to violate the law by taking a job.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.718" offset="6477571">Well, Justice Scalia, what the law says is that when you are arrested, you are arrested upon probable cause, just as in a criminal case, you would be arrested upon probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.118" offset="6531174">Under our immigration laws, whether you have a right to work or not depends on your status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.271" offset="6559804">The Attorney General has hired 81 immigration judges and sent them throughout the country to hold hearings to determine your status, to determine your deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.482" offset="6612572">Until that determination has been made, it seems highly unfair to make the presumption that everyone arrested is definitely a deportable alien and unauthorized to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.220" offset="6667533">That's the very point of that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.601" offset="6677146">The Attorney General slips back and forth between two descriptions of the class members in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.067" offset="6714972">He frequently in his brief, when he's trying to drive home a point, refers to them as illegal aliens, much in the same thrust of your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.074" offset="6754991">They're just illegal aliens, they're not authorized to work anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.858" offset="6770142">But once in a while if you look at the Attorney General's brief he describes them for what they really are; they're simply people charged in deportation hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.404" offset="6812356">This Court recognized in Lopez-Mendoza that the majority of INS enforcement activity takes place in what are called area control operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.960" offset="6850495">These are mass operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.672" offset="6857391">This Court described those operations as chaotic in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.897" offset="6874319">It is simply not fair to assume that INS is right 100 percent of the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1692.455" offset="6916532">And Congress thinks that the chances of the Attorney General being guilty of deception versus the chances of the arrestees being guilty of deception are such that the Attorney General may, if he wishes, not grant any bond at all and just keep the person in absolute detention and say never mind, I don't have to worry about your not working, I'm going to keep you in detention until this matter is cleared up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.267" offset="7039726">Congress, Justice Scalia, spent 10 years debating legislation introduced by Congressman Hobbs, who also introduced all the anti-Communist legislation that was on the books in the late 1940's and 1950's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.248" offset="7103674">Congressman Hobbs introduced his first H.R. 10 in 1939 and every year for the next 10 years he introduced legislation not just to detain every alien as you're suggesting, but just to limit the detention of four categories of aliens pending their deportation; criminals, subversives, dope peddlers, and slave traders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.655" offset="7217359">Just... that's all that Congressman Hobbs wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.639" offset="7229270">And anyone who reads the congressional debates, it will become absolutely plain that despite year after year of effort just to convince Congress to give the Attorney General the power to detain those four groups of aliens, just those four groups, that's what he was concerned about, every single Congress rejected his bill until finally in 1950 he backed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.810" offset="7353927">And he said, okay, Congress, H.R. 10 as introduced in 1950 for the first time said, I want the Attorney General to have the power to detain just those four groups of aliens, but now I'm willing to say he should detain them once they've been found deportable, not pending the hearing, just once they've been found deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.116" offset="7451207">And Congress rejected that proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.500" offset="7468656">In fact, one of the, one of the chief supporters of the Hobbs bill, H.R. 10, stated at the end of that process that the Senate wouldn't even dignify the bill with a vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.675" offset="7805427">Firstly, the Court said the Attorney General is not left with untrammeled authority as to bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.730" offset="7837610">The Attorney General must justify his refusal of bail by reference to the legislative scheme to eradicate the evils of Communist activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.207" offset="7871569">This is a permissible delegation of legislative power because the executive judgment is limited by adequate standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.021" offset="7902812">When dealing with the alien Communists, as in these cases, the legislative standard for deportation is definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.765" offset="7933741">And in fact, the detention language that we are discussing here today appears for the first time in the National Security Act of 1950 which specifically not only defined Communist activity, it held that that activity specifically subjected the person to deportation from the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2290.962" offset="9310498">And that is that one has to look at the whole law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.653" offset="9329306">I don't think one can just look at one phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.685" offset="9341427">This is a comprehensive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.999" offset="9350727">In this statute, as this Court held, has held twice now, in De Canas v. Bica, and... this Court has made clear that in 1952 the employment of aliens was at best a peripheral concern of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.073" offset="9434945">Congress itself stated that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.153" offset="9443305">Congress itself did not make the employment of undocumented workers illegal until 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.690" offset="9477473">And then this wasn't just some Congressman, any Congressman, who rejected the notion of detaining aliens for working improperly, this was Senator Simpson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.917" offset="9522403">Senator Simpson is the author of the 1986 law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.878" offset="9538181">And when a witness testified in front of Senator Simpson and said, well, instead of penalizing employers we can far better serve the country by detaining aliens who work without authorization, Senator Simpson squared that approach and said this is a harsh, he called it harsh, he called it unrealistic, and he called it a proposal made out of a sense of frustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.665" offset="9645388">The 1952 law, this Court has made very clear in the Sure-Tan case and in De Canas, these are recent decisions of this Court, this Court has made clear Congress... I don't necessarily agree with this and this Court probably doesn't agree with it, but in 1952 Congress at best had a peripheral concern with the employment of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.703" offset="9737548">And in fact, as a predicate to the 1952 act Congress ordered up a study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.789" offset="9761894">Congress conducted a study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.149" offset="9767327">The Senate conducted a study pursuant to Senate Resolution 137.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.754" offset="9785718">Nothing in that detailed study suggests a concern with unauthorized employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.856" offset="9806093">That report states, it's Senate Report 1515, 80th Congress, that reports states that foreign labor does not present a serious immigration problem today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.414" offset="9848307">Adequate safeguards are included... and they mean in the 1952 proposed law... adequate safeguards are included to insure that such aliens will not be admitted if unemployed persons in the U.S. are capable of performing such services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.094" offset="9903060">And the adequate safeguard that Congress came up with was section 212(a)(14) of the act which says you're excludable from the United States if you come to the United States intending to work and you do not have a work permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.853" offset="9958126">I would like to read you the one sentence, the key sentence from the conference report about section 1182(a)(14).</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.099" offset="9987070">It says it is the opinion of the committee, and this is the conference committee, that this provision will adequately provide for the protection of American labor against an influx of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.657" offset="10037329">Now again, if the Attorney General... I can only tell you that when you read the legislative history leading up to the 1952 act and there is poor old Congressman Hobbs struggling to convince Congress just to allow the Attorney General to detain four groups of aliens and then backing off and saying, okay, I'll go along with it if you, how about we just detain them once they're found deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.377" offset="10156239">And Congress says to that, no way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.216" offset="13647556">And the reason it was needed is that Congress did not want to allow the release of aggravated felons.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.084" offset="13694994">The Attorney General, under this law, cannot release aggravated felons under any bond condition unless he determines that they pose no risk of flight and no danger to the community.</text>

I just will direct the Court, if I might, to the appendix to the petition in our reply brief which points out that subsection (c) which contains the legislative history to which he refers does limit detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.151" offset="13907318">But that, that provision had lifetime detention for those four classes of aliens after a finding of deportability.</text>
