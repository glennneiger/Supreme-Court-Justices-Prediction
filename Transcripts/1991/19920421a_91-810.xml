            <text syncTime="13.581" offset="197349">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.922" offset="214799">The issue presented in this case is whether a district court, in determining a reasonable hourly fee, a reasonable fee award under Federal fee-shifting statutes, may enhance that award above the lodestar amount in order to reflect the fact that plaintiff's attorneys have taken the case on a contingent fee basis, thus assuming the risk of receiving no attorney's fees at all, and this case the district court denied a preliminary injunction motion and ultimately issued an order on the merits which denied all of the relief sought by the plaintiff and granted relief limited to the ratification of a preexisting state court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.504" offset="401104">On that basis, when determining the reasonable attorney's fees to be awarded to the plaintiffs, the district court concluded to award the full lodestar amount and in addition a contingency bonus or enhancement to reflect the fact that plaintiff's counsel had taken the case on a contingency basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.441" offset="496817">The decision that the enhancement award was in order was based upon the bizarre conclusions that in the first place the plaintiff's loss of the preliminary injunction motion somehow entitled plaintiffs to be compensated at a greater rate, not only with respect to the effort expended with respect to the preliminary injunction motion and other claims that were lost, but with respect to all hours devoted to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.971" offset="626907">Secondly, the court based its decision on its determination that plaintiff's attorney who brought and prosecuted the case with no guarantee of an enhancement was nevertheless entitled to the enhancement award.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.356" offset="712484">This case, we submit, demonstrates an example of the Hensley lodestar method of fee calculation run amuck.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.854" offset="754489">Our response to the precise issue presented to the Court is first, no enhancement for a, of a lodestar fee to reflect risk of lost contingency should ever be granted, for the reason that any such award of an enhancement is necessarily speculative and contrary to the evidence of the market's response to risk of loss assumption as demonstrated by the evidence before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.540" offset="5185274">I'd like to begin by addressing the question that has arisen already as to what hourly rate a court does look at and should look at in calculating the lodestar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.210" offset="5243893">I would note that at page 14 of the ABA's brief they mention that the only ascertainable prevailing market rate is the rate charged to clients who pay regardless of the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.648" offset="5293630">So as a practical matter it is difficult if not impossible to find lawyers in the market who tell their clients I will charge you $25 an hour if you're willing to pay regardless of whether we win or lose, but if you want me to take this on a contingency basis then I'm going to charge you $40 an hour.</text>

            <text syncTime="1333.231" offset="5475965">I think that that is still the prevailing practice, that when a lawyer takes a contingency, makes a contingency arrangement he contracts with the client for some percentage of the ultimate recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.249" offset="5524030">Now, Justice Stevens raised the question well, what if you can get an economist to come in and say I have looked at all of these contingency arrangements and I have decided that in fact they end up amounting to $40 an hour of compensation for the lawyers rather than 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.431" offset="5588814">We would say that it may be fair in that case for a lawyer to charge $40 to his client, but the fairness in that instance resides on the fact that it is the product of the consensual arrangement between the plaintiff and his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.182" offset="5651821">In the fee-shifting context the situation is very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.525" offset="5665196">There isn't this consensual relationship at all that determines the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.718" offset="5681914">In fact the defendant in the case is required to pay the plaintiff not based on the defendant's conduct that led to the suit in the first place, and for that matter not based on the defendant's conduct during the trial, but based--</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.750" offset="6718035">I just want to emphasize the first point that, even assuming we get beyond these evidentiary difficulties and decide that in fact the contingency market charges $40 an hour, it is still very different from saying that that's fair to charge a client, to go from that conclusion to the conclusion that this is fair to make a defendant pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.184" offset="6803821">Again, this charge is not based on the defendant's conduct, but is based on whatever arrangement the plaintiff has made with his attorney, and we don't think that Congress intended the term reasonable attorney's fee to mean different things depending simply on what arrangement the plaintiff has made with his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.905" offset="6874665">And in fact this Court rejected a similar view of congressional intent in Blanchard v. Bergeron where it held that the amount of the fee cannot be determined by whatever contract the plaintiff has made with his attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.818" offset="7066299">Nonetheless many of the lower courts, including the court in this case, has held that this arrangement, this contingency arrangement that was in fact made is a basis for enhancing the lodestar fee by 25 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.938" offset="7118858">Beyond the evidentiary problems, and we think the unfairness problem that this confronts or assumes that Congress intended, there are a number of fundamental conceptual difficulties with the market theory that is driving our opponent's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.241" offset="7184059">In our view one essential flaw is that it assumes that litigation under fee-shifting statutes should operate in the same way as litigation does in the private market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.704" offset="7221885">But in fact the very existence of the fee-shifting provision radically alters the way the litigation will proceed, as this Court recognized in Evans v. Jeff D..</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.102" offset="7263472">In a fee-shifting case there is this prospect of a lodestar or some sort of award sitting at the end of the litigation that will influence the way a defendant considers litigating the case and influence the defendant's judgments about making a settlement or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.394" offset="7328673">That same dynamic doesn't operate in the typical contingency case where the plaintiff in a personal injury suit, for example, pays the same amount as a judgment whether the plaintiff has a contingency arrangement with his attorney or not, and if there is a contingency arrangement whether the attorney is going to get 25 percent or 40 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.929" offset="7410802">The only point here is that the dynamics are different, and so there's no reason to assume that the litigation should operate the way the market operates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2834.057" offset="11479321">And I think when you take all of these statutes together you come to a conclusion that Congress, under these statutes where it did not put limitations on reasonable attorney's fees, meant for the market to govern, and that contingent risk may be taken into account under appropriate circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.749" offset="11562077">Justice Scalia's statement in Casey I think is right to the point, where the Court said a comparison of statutes is proper because statutes are construed to contain that permissible meaning which fits most logically and comfortably with the body of both previously and subsequently enacted law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3500.499" offset="14145065">That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.652" offset="14153633">And the term reasonable attorney's fees has, as I have discussed, been used to focus the courts upon the relevant market as best as the courts can find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.344" offset="14220402">In conclusion, local courts have discretion to consider the risk of non-payment as a part of reasonable attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.152" offset="14267632">The courts should have that discretion, just as local courts consider other aspects of the award of reasonable attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.749" offset="14306084">In the legal marketplace fixed fees are treated differently, generally treated differently than contingent fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.306" offset="14336281">The two should not be considered the same in the determination of a reasonable attorney's fees.</text>

            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="3554.639" offset="14361672">I would think if it's, I would think the way to go about this compensation for risk would be to pay the lawyer when he loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.306" offset="14404304">He has taken... you know, you want these people to have lawyers, and if a lawyer is willing to take this case, he, some lawyers are bound to lose, you ought to pay them for that rather than have the defendant when he wins have to pay for the cases when you lose.</text>

            <label>Mr. Barry L. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="3586.090" offset="14487478">Justice White, I would disagree with you on that, but the important point is that Congress has decided that question and determined that only prevailing parties obtain fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.158" offset="14535648">And the result of that, coupled with Justice O'Connor's test, is that the marketplace forces attorneys to weed out the less worthy cases and to select the strongest cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.438" offset="14596775">Lastly, under different statutes and for many years courts have considered risk of non-payment in determining reasonable attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.755" offset="14630107">The Court should affirm this long-standing practice and adopt the practical and workable approach suggested by Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.401" offset="14664693">Thank you.</text>
