            <text syncTime="19.745" offset="215727">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.665" offset="231400">The petitioners in this case challenge the constitutionality of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 as being in violation of the Federal system, and specifically we place our reliance on the Tenth Amendment and the Guaranty Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.459" offset="314574">We recognize that Congress certainly has the power under the Commerce Clause to deal with the subject of the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, but it is our position that the means that it has chosen here is constitutionally defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.713" offset="383642">This act is directed solely at the states and makes the states responsible for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste that is generated within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.232" offset="441738">It makes the states responsible for the disposition of the waste of private generators, Federal generators, as well as any that is generated by the state itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.189" offset="493565">This is a totally mandatory provision which requires the states to stay, to enter and to stay in the field of low-level, disposal of low-level radioactive waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.368" offset="542257">The mandate is made particularly effective by the so-called take title provision which specifies that if the state has not otherwise provided for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste by January 1, 1996 that the state must take title of any such waste, and if it doesn't accept possession that it becomes liable for any, to the other generators if there are any damages, direct or indirect.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.532" offset="686871">In other words, one way or the other the states are simply ordered by Congress to enter this activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.218" offset="725637">The statute is truly unique in the annals of American jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.201" offset="753640">We know of no other situation where the states have simply been mandated to take part in a particular activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.167" offset="789480">In the past what Congress has done, it has essentially recruited the states in one of two ways to do the regulation that the Federal Government would like to have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.760" offset="855831">It has either, as in the Hodel case involving the land mine, surface act, it gives the states an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.305" offset="898045">You regulate according to the standards set out by the Federal Government, or otherwise we, the Federal Government, will do the regulation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.152" offset="937438">The other means that they have chosen is the Spending Clause, and to provide Federal money as an inducement for the states to do regulation in accordance with Federal standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.164" offset="1081425">Well, it's our position that the means that the Congress uses is a very important consideration in the constitutional structure of this, of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.306" offset="1145999">It is our basic position that the Constitution contemplates two sets of sovereigns and that the states are intended to have the choice as to which activities they will participate in.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.507" offset="1214858">So we think that the means that the Congress chooses is by no means a minor one.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.570" offset="1239100">We think it is a vital one, and we think it's a serious incursion on the constitutional structure.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.138" offset="1465320">Well, as we point out in our brief, we think the legislative history, all of which really shows up in the congressional record I think on December 19 of 1985, the day that this law was passed, shows that the, we don't think it would have been passed by simply excising the take title provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.263" offset="1553823">We think probably some law would have been passed, but it may have been something very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.306" offset="1573990">And as we read your cases that, if it is clear, as we think it is, they wouldn't have passed the legislation by simply excising the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.474" offset="1614636">Then it's not severable, and there isn't any severability clause here.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.737" offset="1687779">Well, as we read the legislative history, it came at the instance of the governors of the so-called sited states, ones that had disposal sites, and they made it plaint that they did not think that the legislation as it stood at that point was sufficiently, it didn't have enough teeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.309" offset="1770013">And they were concerned that the same thing that happened under the 1980 act would happen with respect to the 1985 act, so they said we need teeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.895" offset="1804390">However, the question of, this Court will have to decide whether it is severable or not, and all I can do is I think refer the Court, in addition to what I have said here on severability, to our brief and commend that you examine that legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="2050.581" offset="8339077">It is far from clear what, if any, actual enforceable liabilities, enforceable in Federal or state court, would be imposed by this, given the clear statement rule of the Atascadero case and other questions about possible implementation of this provision would arise when and if it ever comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.706" offset="8443567">There is no indication that New York will ever actually be subject to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.440" offset="8458509">It's even doubtful whether the generators, if it did kick in, would make the request that would impose this on New York because they don't like to call attention to themselves in ways that might create public controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.732" offset="8531756">There's much that is speculative and in our view premature about the complaint concerning the take title provision that New York is asking this Court to use as a vehicle for undoing this entire statutory scheme, even though it has had the benefit of the extension of time for disposing of its waste in the sited states and the payments made under this scheme for a period of many years now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.624" offset="8663309">And I might point out that most of the amici who are supporting New York with respect to this issue that is prematurely presented agree with us on the severability question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.983" offset="8712733">And if I may just say a word about severability, the answer to that seems quite clear to us for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.161" offset="8761425">One is that the 1985 act displaces and in terms repeals the 1980 act which would again be resurrected if the 1985 act were not severable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.863" offset="8824223">And it is quite apparent that Congress wanted to make improvements by adding incentives and disincentives to the 1980 act and would prefer the remainder of the 1985 act to the 1980 act, and in fact the 1985 act passed unanimously in the House initially without the take title provision which was then added in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.253" offset="8953790">There was never a dissenting vote recorded in any of the enactments of the entire 1985 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.051" offset="8992974">And like the 1980 act which took basically the same approach, it was signed into law by a president who was himself a former governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.498" offset="9046786">So the circumstances that gave rise to this enactment make it singularly implausible to think of it as an attempt to aggrandize Federal power at the expense of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.880" offset="9112301">Indeed the most basic provision of the act is the conferral of power on the states, acting through the regional compacts, to discriminate against interstate commerce which they would not be allowed to do otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.912" offset="9188475">And other than the take title provision which is not ripe for review in our view, we believe that the provisions of which New York complains are squarely within the principle of South Dakota against Dole.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.112" offset="9429219">And the House itself had unanimously passed the '85 act without the take title provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.559" offset="9467044">So there seems little doubt about what the proper resolution of that is if... Congress of course could amend either, but there's no reason to think it would prefer to start with the '80 act rather than the remainder of the '85 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.769" offset="9535903">But we think that the constitutional power of Congress was adequate to the task in the manner Congress went about this, that the commerce power, as augmented by the necessary and proper clause, allowed Congress here to enact this measured series of incentives and disincentives to redress the inequities that had occurred among the states and to provide assurance not only that those inequities would not reoccur as they had after the 1980 enactment, but that the serious threat that they posed to important national concerns would not be threatened again because of failure to provide sufficient incentives in honoring the states' request that they be allowed to exercise the regulatory authority here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.347" offset="9822205">We think it would be singularly inappropriate to adopt in judicial hindsight some kind of a least restrictive alternative approach to adjudging Federal legislation of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.956" offset="11964559">One was authored by Justice Powell, and Justice Powell focused on the fourth National League of Cities test to look to see whether the Federal interest is demonstrably greater and state compliance is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.264" offset="12013879">Now I submit in this case the Federal interest is demonstrably great, simply because nuclear, the nuclear waste area is something that the Federal Government has been involved in, and it's a problem that must be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.995" offset="12068736">Justice Kennedy's handgun example, people certainly differ about whether handguns are a problem or whether they should be regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.971" offset="12096635">But no one here is saying that we don't need to safely dispose of nuclear waste.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="2995.242" offset="12117741">Well, and I suppose everyone would agree that we need to solve the problem of medical care of the indigent and we need to solve crime and we need to solve prison space, and so forth and so on.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="3006.991" offset="12164762">But it's a unique concern of the Federal Government, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.602" offset="12175211">The second point that I would say why there is a Federal interest is that this case involves a central concern of the Commerce Clause, and that was something that Justice Powell focused on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.480" offset="12214708">This is not a case where the Federal Government through the Commerce Clause power has the ability to have a wide reach and deal with other kinds of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.164" offset="12253474">This goes to the heart of the Commerce Clause because of the dispute between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.247" offset="12269774">When one state acts to have a site, then other states are relieved of the responsibility, and that inherent conflict, I think, means that the, it is a central concern that the Federal Government in those limited states can make a kind of command to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.629" offset="12343335">Also I think state compliance is essential simply because you have to do something with this waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.644" offset="12367368">It needs to be dealt with.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3059.153" offset="12373428">Isn't there a fundamental difference between this case and Garcia in that when this statute says each state shall be responsible for providing for the disposal of waste, it doesn't limit it to waste generated by the state itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.487" offset="12446780">It means all waste in the state, and therefore this statute cannot be complied with by the state without the state using its sovereign powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.371" offset="12478231">The Federal Government is directing the state how to exercise its sovereign powers.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="3090.656" offset="12499443">It's directing the state to take responsibility, Justice Scalia.</text>

            <text syncTime="3092.937" offset="12508533">Well, you can put it that way if you like, but it can't take responsibility for somebody else's waste without exercising its sovereign powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.701" offset="12539567">And that was not Garcia.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.927" offset="12572481">The states are not, are given maximum amount of flexibility to decide how to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.072" offset="12601111">There are nine compacts that have been formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.544" offset="12606963">The states have a wide option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.005" offset="12616785">The last point I'd like to make before I take my seat is just to concur with counsel for the Government that if the Court finds the so-called take title provision invalid, that it is clearly severable from the remainder of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.605" offset="12675195">There is no severability clause, but there is a presumption in favor of severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.237" offset="12689719">It passed the House unanimously, and in fact the act would operate just fine without the so-called take title provision because this act gives part of the power of, the Federal power to the states so that the states actually have the ability when acting within a compact to exclude waste that is generated from outside the compact region.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.646" offset="12799328">And that is why we would say that this does not, is not detrimental to the state power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.209" offset="12825660">In fact states have a lot of autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.721" offset="12839661">They have choices about how to deal with it, albeit with the take title provision they must be responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.916" offset="12860455">They have a wide range of options of how to deal with the waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.971" offset="12880621">They can enter into compacts, they can contract with compacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.484" offset="12894728">One compact can contract with another compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.536" offset="12906953">The only thing that they are prohibited from doing under the take title provision is simply ignoring the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.569" offset="12935061">So we would request that this Court affirm the judgment below or, if the Court finds that the take title provision is invalid, the Court should sever that provision and sustain the remainder of the law which we think is an excellent example of the partnership between the Federal Government and the state government.</text>
