            <text syncTime="305.441" offset="1371066">There are two... SIPC essentially paid out money to two categories of investors, people who were customers of the failed brokerage firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.095" offset="1397711">They paid out money to investors who bought and sold the allegedly manipulated securities, and they paid out money to people who didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.682" offset="1424042">Now, as to the people who did buy and sell the allegedly manipulated securities, they commenced a class action.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.472" offset="1471167">As to the people who didn't buy or sell the allegedly manipulated securities, SIPC can't be subrogated to their claim because they, like SIPC, are too remote from the event to have a claim in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.530" offset="1519441">Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit held that the only way SIPC can acquire a subrogation right... and this is in an earlier case.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.719" offset="1560192">In an earlier case, which is in the record, the Ninth Circuit held that SIPC is subrogated to any fraud claims if and only if the brokers who SIPC came in to pay out exercised unauthorized use of customer funds to buy the manipulated securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.811" offset="1624558">That didn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.894" offset="1628947">Discovery has established that didn't happen, so there's no fraud claim for SIPC to be subrogated to.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.768" offset="2400395">What that has come to mean in the decisions of this Court and other courts is essentially that a person must be directly injured in their business or property.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.291" offset="2798501">But if one accepts the notion that SIPC isn't subrogated to anything, then one reaches the general question.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.397" offset="2830893">I think SIPC is subrogated to nothing, and we reach the general question.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.849" offset="2844685">And the general question... the first proposition on the general question is that we do not have a party that was directly injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.669" offset="2876032">SIPC was not directly injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.455" offset="2883138">If there were direct victims, it were the purchasers and sellers of these allegedly manipulated securities, not SIPC.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.823" offset="2904662">The second important point, I believe, is that any injury to SIPC was not by reason of the alleged fraud in... of the sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.380" offset="2942801">And what I mean by that is that this Court has said in Sedima, SIPC paying out money.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.057" offset="3001524">Here there were many, many intervening events.</text>

            <text syncTime="721.628" offset="3035797">Now, in addition, for that to happen, it had to be the case that these two brokerage firms took a large position in the allegedly manipulated securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.584" offset="3067667">And it had to be the case that the brokerage firms were otherwise in precarious financial condition, and therefore, taking this position and these securities caused their financial demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.589" offset="3103715">It had to be the case that SIPC comes in and says, well, let's make the failure of these brokerage firms subject to SIPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.445" offset="3131092">And it had to be the case that the composition of the assets of the defunct brokerage firms was such that they could not pay out or simply give to the customers of the brokerage firms their securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.384" offset="3174873">All of those events, none of which were intended or foreseen by the persons that allegedly committed the securities fraud, had to occur before SIPC would sustain the loss that it sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.785" offset="4348502">And the third... the third one has to do with in effect, Blue Chip, and that is this: that the RICO predicate act is defined as fraud in the sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.391" offset="4394896">And that's a very interesting definition of a predicate act, it contrasts with the other predicate acts in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.378" offset="4414853">All the other predicate acts define crimes as crimes, for example, murder, kidnappings, State crimes... and also Federal crimes by citation to Federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.567" offset="4451634">If there was going to be a parallel incorporation of a securities crime, it should have said, for example, any violation of section 32 of the Securities Exchange Act, which is what criminalizes securities law violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.041" offset="4497505">It doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.160" offset="4501998">It says something much more narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.926" offset="4508999">It says fraud in the sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.462" offset="4515164">It also doesn't say any fraud in connection with securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.747" offset="4532300">That would be fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.247" offset="4534285">But no, this predicate act is more narrowly drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.282" offset="4546406">Fraud in the sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.582" offset="4555601">That makes the concept of sale central.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.334" offset="4566677">And that brings us, in my view, to the Chief Justice's excellent opinion when he was an associate justice in Blue Chip Stamp, which spoke about what the requirements were for standing with respect to fraud in the sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.542" offset="4615474">And those principles... that decision in 1975, was based upon, and involved from a principal of law back in the Birnbaum case, dating back to 1952, a Second Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.932" offset="4653090">And those principles were accepted ever since 1952, even earlier, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.551" offset="4671480">They've existed in securities law for 40 years, and when RICO was passed in 1970, Congress reflected no intention to overrule, subvert, circumvent, do away with, existing securities laws, principles, and decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.811" offset="4728532">And so that standing limitation that comes from Blue Chip should be carried forward when looking at RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.965" offset="4757162">And RICO talks about fraud in the sale of securities because that's a piece of learning, basic learning, about what fraud in the sale of securities is and involved, and it's a settled, litigated matter at the Supreme Court level, that is a decision that there was no objection to at all anywhere in the congressional history of RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.224" offset="4822259">So it seems to me we have here all but an incorporation by reference in the listing of predicate acts of this decision in Blue Chip, and the whole developed notions of securities law and standing surrounding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.317" offset="4878579">And they carry with it certain principles of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.936" offset="4889028">Congress didn't intend to overrule those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.471" offset="4899164">They should be carried forward into RICO when RICO incorporates fraud in the sale of securities as a predicate act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.958" offset="4925182">So those are the principal reasons why I think essentially we have a situation where the very language of section 1964(c) in its three component parts,</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.314" offset="4966560">"injured in his business or property. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.015" offset="4973351">RICO either because of the way RICO was drafted or because of what RICO incorporates by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.279" offset="5054435">But either way, one reaches the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.231" offset="5066243">Now, there are a couple of arguments that I've seen in SIPC's brief, and I'm sure that the Court has looked at them and has considered them, and I'd like to comment on them for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.801" offset="5100515">One has to do with the principle of broad construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.838" offset="5360695">And when one does that here, one reaches a conclusion, I believe, that there's no standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.369" offset="5558808">The Ninth Circuit and SIPC have tended to put significance of that and have said that because RICO is express and Blue Chip is dealing with implied remedy, somehow the construction of them should be different, or the construction of RICO should be more broad because one is dealing with an express statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.482" offset="5635294">But if one looks at what it is that's expressed in 1964(c), what the express... statute expresses, it has the very limitations on it that we are arguing for... namely, that the injury must be by reason of, and it must be injury to the business or property of the claimant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3138.253" offset="12702357">First, that the concept of subrogation is limited to get reimbursement for what you paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.139" offset="12725867">SIPC isn't seeking reimbursement for what they paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="3149.524" offset="12747392">So the whole idea of subrogation and RICO are inconsistent because RICO, 1964(c), mandates treble damages.</text>
