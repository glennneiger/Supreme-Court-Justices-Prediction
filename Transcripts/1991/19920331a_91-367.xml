            <text syncTime="59.872" offset="375285">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I represent two young girls, one 9 and one 7, who come before you through their mother as their next friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.096" offset="424186">Their parents were divorced and their mother was awarded full custody, and during the court-ordered visitation they were physically and sexually molested by their father and his girlfriend.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.356" offset="481238">Because of the abuse, the Jefferson Parish, Louisiana Juvenile Court through its child protection statutes permanently terminated all the parental rights of the father and permanently enjoined him from having any contact whatsoever with the children again.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.966" offset="547693">Therefore, under State law he is a legal stranger to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.269" offset="564934">That decision was never appealed and is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.071" offset="584160">After that decision, the children filed suit against their father and his girlfriend in tort, in Federal court in Louisiana, under diversity of citizenship, because they were no longer residing in the same State.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.348" offset="649257">The district court in the Fifth Circuit through the case out saying what this really is is a domestic relations case over which the Federal courts have no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.824" offset="691158">I think it's first important to note what this case is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.810" offset="715086">This case is not about establishing a new Federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.798" offset="739014">This case has nothing to do with the concerns expressed by the Chief Justice and other Members of this Court about creating new Federal causes of action such as the actions now pending before Congress concerning making all crimes against women perhaps civil rights actions which could be brought in Federal courts, or against making all crimes committed with handguns Federal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.032" offset="851968">There's no question, and it's never been contested in this case, that all of the elements of diversity have been satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.571" offset="890106">Well, we could go further, could we not, Mr. Ducote, in saying what the case is not about, in saying that it is not about a decree of divorce, it is not about child custody, it's not about probate... something like that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Lynn Ducote</label>
            <text syncTime="202.731" offset="946740">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.347" offset="949248">It's a simple diversity tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.849" offset="959279">Every tort action under diversity is a State and a local cause of action, just as this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.776" offset="1011001">If these children had been, say, run over by their father by an automobile they would have Federal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.131" offset="1052379">If they had been sexually molested, say, by their minister or by their schoolteacher, they would have a Federal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.904" offset="1091458">Perhaps... and it's not clear under the Fifth Circuit's test where the line would be drawn, but perhaps if it had been an uncle... an uncle or an aunt or a first cousin who had molested them, they'd also be able to sue in Federal court under diversity of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.366" offset="1161362">Why is it, then, that the Federal courts can abstain or simply refuse to hear a case because it's the father who's involved, and I submit that they can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.089" offset="1204203">I don't believe that the test of Federal jurisdiction is whether or not we want to get involved, when the Federal courts say I don't want to get involved because it sounds too much like a family matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.741" offset="1306812">As I understand, your position is if it were probate, if it were any traditional family matter, there would still be no basis for the Federal court staying out, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="336.234" offset="1480787">If what is sued for is money, then yes, if the $50,000 threshold is met and the diversity criteria are met, the Federal courts have jurisdiction until Congress says otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.866" offset="1771269">I mean, that, like divorce, has been considered traditionally a nontransitory cause of action, so you had to sue within the State where the property was.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.674" offset="1822573">If you sued in another State's courts you couldn't get it, but your position is you can sue in any Federal court for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.245" offset="1952872">Don't you think that that congressional mandate took into account accepted notions of transitory causes of action and nontransitory causes of action so that it was entirely understood that to get a divorce you could only sue in the court of the State where the people are resident?</text>

            <text syncTime="480.462" offset="2057675">Unfortunately, and as all of the Law Review articles and Judge Weinstein in the Spindel case point out, most of what the courts have said about the domestic relations exception have been on very weak grounding, that these things about well, ecclesiastical courts used to do this, and courts of equity didn't do this and all, just don't apply, and I think with the position, unfortunately, where we have to look at what the Constitution says about who decides what Federal courts have jurisdiction over and return the responsibility to Congress to sort through the problems that you're suggesting, I think as a matter of principle if the Federal courts can simply define their own jurisdictional boundaries we just have all sorts of--</text>

            <text syncTime="535.732" offset="2278776">They're just assuming that the congressional grant of jurisdiction, if not the constitutional grant of jurisdiction, took into account ordinary notions of nontransitory causes of action that could only be brought in certain courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.540" offset="2326005">What about criminal jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="549.141" offset="2332379">Can Federal courts try for State crimes?</text>
            <text syncTime="552.343" offset="2345231">The traditional notion is that no sovereign enforces the criminal laws of another sovereign.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.501" offset="2513878">In some of our cases, Mr. Ducote, we've said that when Congress enacts a jurisdictional measure it takes it with knowledge of any judicial gloss on it, so to speak, such as Canon v. University of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.315" offset="2593081">Now, this Court has been speaking about domestic relations exceptions to diversity jurisdiction since the turn of the century, and the Congress has revisited the diversity statute several times and never made any addition to it indicating that it disapproved of that exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.144" offset="2676464">Doesn't that suggest that your analysis is a little bit two-dimensional when you simply say well, we just look at the statute?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Lynn Ducote</label>
            <text syncTime="642.398" offset="2705408">Well, the Court... the last pronouncement was in the 1930's on the domestic relations exception, except for Thompson v. Thompson in 1988, when in a footnote the Court talked about the tradition of the domestic relations exception, and what I'm saying... and again, I don't think this is essential for us to prevail in this cause of action, but I think what we have to do is sort of pull that all back together and make some sense out of it and get back to the issue that Congress needs to set out what the parameters of Federal jurisdiction are and what are the exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.292" offset="2864963">And I think Congress did an excellent job of that in 1990 in the supplemental jurisdiction provision under 28 U.S.C. 1367, where the Court said... Congress said the Federal courts can have supplemental jurisdiction if this criteria is met, this criteria, and they may choose to decline supplemental jurisdiction if State law is uncertain or the issues are too complicated or for other good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.895" offset="2983455">So in that case, Congress specifically authorized an abstention, if you would, from jurisdiction, and I think that's really what we need to do so this doesn't spread further and--</text>

            <text syncTime="766.660" offset="3202466">Absolutely right, and one could easily say that those cases referred to things like seeking a decree of divorce, child custody, other nontransitory causes of action, and that therefore your case is not governed by them, but when you get into the more general area, it seems to me you're arguing for just a rather sweeping clearing of the brush, so to speak, which I'm not sure isn't inconsistent with all our cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Lynn Ducote</label>
            <text syncTime="794.347" offset="3313225">Well, I think the cases of Burrus and Barber and Popovici and De La Rama v. De La Rama have simply said in very broad brush strokes the relations between husband and wife, parent and child, belong to the States and we're not going to get involved in it, and those cases have sort of set up judicial chaos for 100 years in all of the circuits that have led to this sort of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.997" offset="3419804">The fact that in 1991 a Federal district court can look at sexual abuse, a sexual abuse tort action and say that well, this is domestic relations under... citing Barber v. Barber in 19... I'm sorry, 1880, shows the extent to which this issue is still uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.612" offset="3522309">So I think yes, it... again, the principle is important that either Congress sets up the parameters of Federal jurisdiction or the courts do on an ad hoc basis, and that's the concern, but I don't think that's the most important issue here, because these kids should be able to sue in tort no matter who the defendant is if there's a cognizable State cause of action and the other criteria of the diversity statute have been met.</text>

            <text syncTime="939.155" offset="3892516">You know, very often in other contexts, for example in police brutality cases, it's not unusual for there to be State court proceedings and Federal court proceedings in the prosecution as well as administratively in any number of areas, so I think the law should not... or the rules of the game should not change simply because we're dealing with children or because we're dealing with sexual abuse and we're dealing with families.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.257" offset="4016859">I think one of the things that's happened in the courts is this issue is something that people haven't wanted to get involved in, and they've looked for a way to sort of get rid of it, and I think in another context, were it not a family context, those questions wouldn't even be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.802" offset="4095017">And that's sort of what the district court does with the Younger issue and says well, you know, the State court permanently terminated this man's rights, therefore the State's interest in this case is obviously even more compelling than it would be in another case, and that's even more cause for us to keep out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.084" offset="4192193">And I look at it and I say because his rights were terminated, if you apply the Younger rules the State's already finished with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.273" offset="4228973">The man is a legal stranger, so it's even more compelling it should be in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.094" offset="4244229">So again I think the rules have to be clarified... family, no family, whatever.</text>
