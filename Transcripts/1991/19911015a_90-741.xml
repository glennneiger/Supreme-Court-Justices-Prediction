            <text syncTime="64.407" offset="410022">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.262" offset="441474">This case involves an important question under the bankruptcy code, namely whether liens that exceed the value of property in bankruptcy are to be avoided under section 506.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.070" offset="492674">The present bankruptcy is a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a liquidation bankruptcy in which the assets of the debtor are generally sold to pay the claims of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.128" offset="536873">But the interpretation has significance also for the reorganization chapters, Chapters 11 and 13, which deal with business and consumer reorganizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.901" offset="576057">Before the 1978 code, the status of secured creditors in bankruptcy was somewhat unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.756" offset="611479">Incredibly enough, Chapters 11 and 13 under the old code did not deal with secured creditors and, even in a liquidation bankruptcy, the effect of the bankruptcy on a lien was unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.967" offset="672292">What Congress did was to enact section 506.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.337" offset="685771">The two sections of 506 that are relevant here today are section 506(a) and section 506(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="141.491" offset="718372">There is really no dispute between the parties as to the interpretation of section 506(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="147.680" offset="743136">section 506(a) deals with allowed claims, that is, claims which are approved or otherwise come into the bankruptcy proceeding and which are not disallowed by the bankruptcy court.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.237" offset="793395">Mr. Dyk, did you say a moment ago that under the act of 1898 and the Chandler Act, the pre-code, that it was unclear what happened to liens?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_b_dyk" startTime="171.378" stopTime="265.988">
            <label>Mr. Timothy B. Dyk</label>
            <text syncTime="171.378" offset="837908">It was unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.544" offset="842610">There were essentially three situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.080" offset="852746">This was discussed to some extent in the Chase... this Court's decision in the Chase case, which is cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.115" offset="872912">Under Long v. Bullard, the creditor... the secured creditor could choose to ignore the bankruptcy proceedings entirely and the lien would survive the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.840" offset="915753">On the other hand, if the secured creditor went into the bankruptcy proceeding and proved his claim to the full amount, he would have waived his lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.361" offset="949817">The situation that was unclear was when under 57(h), for example, a secured creditor went into bankruptcy and tried to prove part of his claim; that is, the claim that exceeded the value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.705" offset="1011257">And I think it was unclear, and none of the cases cited by the respondents or the United States really deals with this situation... unclear in that situation what happened to the excess lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.811" offset="1051694">Our suggestion is that one of the purposes of section 506 was to deal with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.298" offset="1073637">What 506(a) does is to divide this claim of a secured creditor into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.820" offset="1107701">Part one is to the extent that there is value in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.890" offset="1131942">The creditor has an allowed secured claim in the bankruptcy proceeding and that phrase is not only used in section 506 but in various other sections of the code as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.115" offset="1172902">Then section 506(a) also says to the extent that the lien exceeds the value of the property, that the creditor has an allowed unsecured claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.326" offset="1245732">He does have the option to stay out of the bankruptcy, but there is a new provision in the '78 code, section 501(c), which allows the trustee or the debtor to force the secured creditor into bankruptcy and to--</text>

            <text syncTime="291.371" offset="1317934">If he stays out of the bankruptcy, the trustee or the debtor can override that and bring him in.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.810" offset="1355655">No, and that was an important part of the 1978 code, was to bring the secured creditors into the bankruptcy to deal with their claims and to avoid these wandering liens which might exist to the extent that the lien exceeded the value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.904" offset="1416050">Now there is no question about this bifurcation into the secured claim and the unsecured claim that's accomplished by 506(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="326.092" offset="1456801">And I think there's no dispute that 506(a) applies to property that will be abandoned or has been abandoned just as it must apply to exempt property.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.735" offset="1543319">506(a) provides for a hearing to determine the value.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.687" offset="1563172">Most courts have said that the value, I think, is to be determined at the time of the filing of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.174" offset="1585115">And the court sets the value and that then determines what the secured claim is allowed... the secured claim is and what the allowed unsecured claim is.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="368.815" offset="1627642">I suppose if the value has gone up after the time of filing, then the trustee wouldn't abandon it and we wouldn't have this problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_b_dyk" startTime="375.385" stopTime="409.808">
            <label>Mr. Timothy B. Dyk</label>
            <text syncTime="375.385" offset="1653973">Well, that's true, and there is a contention here that allowing the debtor to keep any increase in the case of abandoned property creates an unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.610" offset="1698799">Now, one of the reasons that the property may go up in value is that the debtor has continued to make improvements on the property, planted crops in the case of farmland, or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.399" offset="1737983">It is also possible, of course, that the market has changed or that the bankruptcy court has misvalued the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.571" offset="1770688">But I think the opposing parties concede that that kind of misvaluation doesn't happen very often.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="409.808" stopTime="430.020">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="409.808" offset="1791586">If there is a misvaluation, supposing the bankruptcy court says the property is worth $50,000, it turns out it's later sold without any interim improvements for $125,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.401" offset="1858042">Which value prevails?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_b_dyk" startTime="430.020" stopTime="480.451">
            <label>Mr. Timothy B. Dyk</label>
            <text syncTime="430.020" offset="1872462">Well, there is only a provision for the setting of one value in the bankruptcy proceeding, and the first value would prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.625" offset="1898897">But of course, the creditor in the bankruptcy proceeding, if you have property which has no value to the estate, can move for the lifting of the automatic stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.862" offset="1927841">And that would allow the creditor to immediately foreclose on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.980" offset="1944351">So there need not be any time difference between the valuation and the actual sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.718" offset="1963263">There was another concern, and I think it's reflected in the legislative history, and that is that if the creditor could keep the lien to the excess value, he could in essence coerce the debtor to give him more than he might otherwise be entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.845" offset="2035779">That is true because property often has more value to the person who was using it than to a third-party purchaser.</text>

            <text syncTime="480.451" offset="2074231">Well, that's always true, I take it, in the relations between the debtor and the lienholder.</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy B. Dyk</label>
            <text syncTime="492.674" offset="2123133">The lienholder bargained for that, but the idea of bankruptcy is to discharge some of these debts as personal liabilities and to enable the parties to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.398" offset="2177990">For example, if you have a senior lienholder and a junior lienholder, if the junior lien is worthless, this provision allows the elimination of that junior lien so that the debtor can negotiate with the senior creditor and work out a plan for repayment over a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.573" offset="2238698">If you allow the lien to wander around in secured claims, you have all sorts of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.228" offset="2257297">One of those problems is if the creditor in the bankruptcy has secured a payment on this second half of the claim, the allowed unsecured claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.286" offset="2305572">Then what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="540.405" offset="2314035">Let's assume that we have a piece of property that's with a $150 lien on it; it's worth $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.809" offset="2339635">That means that under this provision of the code, that there's a secured claim for $100 and an unsecured claim for $50.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.378" offset="2365967">Well, what happens if the creditor in the bankruptcy secures a distribution from the estate of an additional $25 on the unsecured claim?</text>
            <text syncTime="561.151" offset="2397000">Under the proposal that the opposing parties make here, there isn't any provision in the bankruptcy code to deal with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.222" offset="2429288">Does the creditor keep the $150 lien even though he's already been paid part of his unsecured claim, or what happens?</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="578.328" offset="2465755">Is that true under the Attorney General's interpretation?</text>

            <text syncTime="581.380" offset="2477875">Under the Attorney General's interpretation, the only part of the lien... the only time that a lien would be avoided under 506(d) is if it were a disallowed claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.920" offset="2524060">That cannot have been what Congress meant in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.407" offset="2542032">What the United States attempts to do and what the respondents attempt to do is to divorce section 506(d) from section 506(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="605.513" offset="2574424">What they are saying essentially is even though 506(a) bifurcates the claims into secured claims and unsecured claims, that the lien continues with respect to the unsecured claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.035" offset="2616533">And it continues after bankruptcy and can be enforced against any appreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.023" offset="2644537">But that's not what 506(d) provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.475" offset="2654254">It said that liens are void to the extent that they secure claims which are not allowed secured claims, which includes two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.996" offset="2688422">It includes claims that are disallowed, and it includes claims that are allowed unsecured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.484" offset="2710365">It's almost inconceivable that Congress would have wished to continue a lien with respect to a claim that it had characterized as an allowed unsecured claim and treat it in that respect throughout the bankruptcy proceedings and in various other sections of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.625" offset="2766894">Now the respondents' argument in this case... and the respondents and the United States themselves do not approach this question the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.831" offset="2811720">They want the same result but they cannot agree, apparently, on the reasoning.</text>

            <text syncTime="689.564" offset="2910672">Now the difficulty, of course, in this case is that at the time of the valuation, the property was not abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.285" offset="2937526">It was only after the valuation that the secured creditors, and they were the ones that requested the abandonment, requested the abandonment and the trustee abandoned the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.510" offset="2986427">So it was only after the valuation that this occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.164" offset="3005026">What the respondents suggest is that the code provision should be read to suggest that property that is abandoned or will be abandoned or might be abandoned somehow should not be covered by section 506(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="729.006" offset="3068452">The problem with this interpretation is that they admit that section 506(a) must apply to abandoned property.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.529" offset="3106486">There can be no question about that because section 506(a), by their own admission, is a critical predicate to the redemption provision of section 722 of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.687" offset="3151103">So if section 506(a) applies to abandoned property, as it must, there is no basis for saying that 506(d) does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.644" offset="3202930">And the only argument that the respondents make for this limitation is that there is a phrase in 506(a), property in which the estate has an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.083" offset="3244726">They want to take that phrase from 506(a), read it into 506(d), and then say it has a different meaning in 506(d), that it doesn't include abandoned properties.</text>

            <text syncTime="807.638" offset="3382966">And I think that the parties admit that you have to do that in order for section 722, the personal property redemption section, to work at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.843" offset="3419746">Now there's various reliance by the respondents and the United States on the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.468" offset="3462274">They seem to admit that our reading of this provision is the simple meaning, by which I take it they mean the plain and simple meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.490" offset="3502398">But they say that the legislative history should cause the court to read the provision differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.811" offset="3527684">And they urge that pre-code, it was clear that the lien in this situation was not avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.999" offset="3560390">I have explained why I believe that's a misreading of the pre-code history.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.987" offset="3588393">It was unclear what happened to a lien in the circumstances pre-code; not unclear in what happened in the Long v. Bullard situation where the creditors stay out of the bankruptcy, but unclear what happened to the lien when he came into the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.913" offset="3644086">Then they try to read the legislative history of section 506(d) separately from the legislative history of section 506(a), just again to separate the two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.840" offset="3699779">But the legislative history of section 506(a) makes clear that Congress thought it was making a rather significant change in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.278" offset="3737500">And indeed the legislative history of 506(a) mentions the concern about what happens to liens in this bifurcation situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.170" offset="3781072">So what we suggest is that there is no clear pre-code practice, point one; point two, that if you read the legislative history in its entirety, that it is clearly suggesting that there is a significant change being wrought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.167" offset="3865082">I think if you look at the way 506(a) and (d) are designed to work and the way they carry forward into other sections of the bankruptcy code, you see that the congressional design in this provision could not be fulfilled if you were to adopt either of the readings of the respondents or the United States in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1045.575" offset="4334659">Our lead position in the brief is not so much an affirmative theory of what 506(d) does apply to, as it is a limiting theory of what it cannot sensibly apply to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.432" offset="4378127">And as a matter of fact, the two theories amount to the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.984" offset="4392337">Take the two types of cases... Chapter 11 and 13 on the one hand, where the debtor is supposed to keep the property for future income, and Chapter 7 on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.776" offset="4439462">In Chapter 11 and 13, the only property that will not be abandoned is property the debtor is to keep.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.680" offset="4463077">But 506(d) is completely unnecessary in that, in Chapter 11 and 13, because those chapters provide their own lien-reducing provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.786" offset="4499544">And they do so by carefully balancing creditor and debtor rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.856" offset="4515844">The debtor gets the benefit of the lien reduction only by promising to pay... pay... promising personal liability in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.961" offset="4556282">In Chapter 7, if the property is secured by a lien for more than the property is worth, we entirely agree with petitioner that the property will virtually always be abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.436" offset="4602153">The only exception will be where the property is either going to be purchased under 722, the redemption provision, in which case lien-stripping is completely unnecessary, or will be sold as part of a larger asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.261" offset="4653457">So as a consequence, once one has taken abandoned property which plays no role in the administration of the bankruptcy estate out of the equation, the only thing left for 506(d) to do is to reduce liens on disallowed claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.455" offset="4722212">We have two fundamental reasons why it seems to us clear that Congress did not intend this second--</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.426" offset="4954075">One, (a) is not... even if (a) was to be looked to to interpret (d), the analysis can't stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.997" offset="4980406">And it seems to us clear that the other evidence of what Congress intended, in terms of the substantive effect of the statute, disproves that that's the right way to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.936" offset="5020112">Second, there's no particular reason to think that (d) must be construed in light of (a), simply because they're in 506.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.757" offset="5047384">506 deals with all of the general aspects of secured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.676" offset="5071103">And, indeed, (a) and (d) deal with two completely separate subjects... (a) adjusts the relative payout priorities between secured creditors and unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.984" offset="5116347">Debtors have no interest in the outcome of the bifurcation under (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.455" offset="5134215">(d) has nothing to do with the unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.240" offset="5153337">(d) speaks only to the relationship after bankruptcy, given the property between the debtor and the secured creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.930" offset="5180086">And there is also a practical reason why the picture that petitioner relies on of (d) simply following (a) can't be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.583" offset="5210702">Her theory says, (a) and (d) are really a two-part process; first bifurcate the claim, then reduce the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.355" offset="5241839">But if she's right about what (d) does, that picture is simply upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.176" offset="5265141">In virtually all Chapter 7 cases... perhaps as many as 97 percent... there will be no bifurcation of claims under (a), because there are no assets to distribute to unsecured creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.151" offset="5312997">And so there is no reason to go through a judicial valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.269" offset="5329506">Yet, in all those cases where the collateral is valued less than the lien, the debtor has an incentive to come in, demand a judicial valuation with all the litigation that entails, in the hope that by the time a foreclosure takes place, that judicial valuation will turn out to be wrong... either because of appreciation of the property, or because of judicial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.932" offset="5412158">And so her picture of (d) simply being the second part of a two-part process, which is, I think, the linchpin of her effort to rely on 506(a) in interpreting (d), is, in fact, exactly wrong, if (d)--</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.134" offset="6468968">Petitioner doesn't dispute... and... because it can't be disputed... that if the lien is reduced to the value of the property, then under every State's law, the debtor can exercise her State law rights, pay-off that amount of the lien, and redeem the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.846" offset="6535737">If 506(d) meant that, there would have been no need whatsoever, for 722.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.746" offset="6651407">506(d) would give that right to any debtor... corporate or individual, in any type of bankruptcy proceeding, for any type of property, including commercial farmland.</text>

            <text syncTime="2153.212" offset="8765235">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.484" offset="8806300">The general interest of the United States in administration of the bankruptcy laws is augmented in this case because the United States, through the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and other Federal agencies, is probably the largest undersecured creditor in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.196" offset="8873173">The practical ramifications of this case show why we care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.064" offset="8888638">If petitioner is correct, bankruptcy proceedings not only avoid a debtor's personal liability on its debts, but they also strip down the creditor's interest in its collateral to judicially determined abstract valuation, and allow the debtor to retain any excess sales proceeds... free and clear not only of the lien, but of the claims of all creditors in the bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.811" offset="8975678">Now, before I get started, I'd like to address a problem that Justice Kennedy spoke about, which is the effect of a distribution on... to unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.100" offset="9008801">As Mr. Taranto suggested, this does not happen that often, but the structure of the code does deal with it, under our view, in a perfectly rational way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.356" offset="9037849">When the money... section 506(a) will divide all claims that are allowed into secured claims and unsecured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.379" offset="9081944">If there is a distribution of an unsecured claim of... to general unsecured creditors, the total amount that remains owing to the creditor will be reduced, dollar-for-dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.519" offset="9126457">And so under perfectly normal property principles, the lien also will be reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.440" offset="9146205">If you start with a debt of $100, the bankruptcy judge says the collateral is worth $60, and general unsecured creditors get $5, the lien is now $95 because that's all the debt that's left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.562" offset="9186643">If there's a foreclosure sale, and the collateral sells for $70, the secured creditor would get $70.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.466" offset="9210257">If it sells for $100, the secured creditor would get the $95 he's owed, and the other $5 would go to the debtor, as the owner of the collateral before the sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2272.370" offset="9241918">But in that case, there is a windfall, in some sense, in that he's received pro rata too much from the unsecured portion of the estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.490" offset="9274414">It's not necessary to the decision of this case, I think, to decide how to deal with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.678" offset="9291133">It's the United States' view that if the foreclosure occurs before the bankruptcy proceeding has been completed, you then have a marketplace determination of value, and the creditor's secured claim should be written up to the amount that occurs at the foreclosure sale... or at least there should be a hearing to allow the parties to talk about the value, and introduce that as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.757" offset="9375456">Frankly, it does not seem to me that the reverse should be true: if the foreclosure sale brings a lower value, a lower value than what the bankruptcy judge placed on it, I don't think that in all circumstances the secured claim should be written down, because it's entirely likely that the secured creditor bought the asset for less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.184" offset="9437105">But there should be a hearing to determine what the value of the... the value after the sale, after it has been sold.</text>

            <text syncTime="2341.811" offset="9519652">What the statute says is that the value shall be determined in light of the purpose of the valuation, and of the proposed disposition or use of such property, and in conjunction with any hearing on such disposition or use, or on a plan affecting such creditor's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.369" offset="9569911">It's clear that from that, and from the legislative history, that in some circumstances there should be multiple valuations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.772" offset="9595511">The legislative history gives a number of specific examples.</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.787" offset="9819537">I mean it depends on how much the people want to spend on the valuation, like any other judicial proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2425.076" offset="9852661">But I think that it's helpful to focus on what the purpose of section 506(a) is in doing the bifurcation, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.615" offset="9882858">It... the purpose of this, as shown in the legislative history, is to facilitate reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.336" offset="9905742">Indeed, the legislative history on which petitioner relies, and explains there's a significant change, explains exactly what the purpose of bifurcating the claims is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.989" offset="9940328">And the purpose of bifurcating the claims is not directed at the wandering liens to which petitioner refers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.310" offset="9961644">If you look on the very page of the legislative history to which petitioner refers, it explains the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.464" offset="9982228">It is that the determination of the amount of the secured claim facilitates reorganization, by defining the precise extent of the claims against the debtor, that must be treated specially as secured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.688" offset="10027159">In a reorganization proceeding, the property won't be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.057" offset="10040638">So you have to have a judicial valuation in order to determine how you're going to protect the secured creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.128" offset="10060909">In a liquidation proceeding, the property will be sold in a foreclosure sale, and there'll be a marketplace determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.646" offset="12198979">We're not suggesting that that was what led Congress to create this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.650" offset="12226982">What led Congress to create 506(d) and 506(a) was the desire for certainty, the desire to have the bankruptcy proceeding resolve the matter, to pay off the creditor on his allowed secured claim, to give him an allowed unsecured claim which he could recover from the estate, and to allow the property to pass out of bankruptcy without some wandering lien covering some other amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.698" offset="12331159">One of the purposes of Congress in bankruptcy is to allow the property to go out and to continue to be used for productive purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.121" offset="12360938">Often, real property... and in this case it's farmland... gets used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.858" offset="12391867">Congress doesn't want the property to sit there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.310" offset="12401689">So what happens is that the debtor begins to plant the crops, and farm the property, and to make improvements on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.797" offset="12427603">All of a sudden the value is increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.380" offset="12433872">Well, under those circumstances it would hardly be fair to give that excess value to the secured creditor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3652.286" offset="14761591">And it did it, I suggested earlier, in order to allow people to go on with their lives and improve the property and do things with it without having to worry about the recapture of that accreted value, and without giving the creditor the power at the foreclosure sale to say to the debtor, I can bid $150 for this $100 piece of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3679.687" offset="14871201">And the reason that power exists is that property is often worth more to the debtor than it is to a third party.</text>
