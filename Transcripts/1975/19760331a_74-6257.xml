            <label>Mr. G. Hughel Harrison</label>
            <text syncTime="45.017" offset="284952">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.695" offset="303656">I am Hughel Harrison from Lawrenceville, Georgia and I represent Troy Leon Gregg who is now under two death sentences for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.369" offset="350363">Originally he was tried on two murder charges plus two armed robbery cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.568" offset="383172">The Georgia Supreme Court on its review of the case, set aside the death penalties as to armed robbery and that the -- for two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.582" offset="431238">That the armed robbery had been used as a aggravating circumstance on the murder cases and that the death penalty was disproportionate for the punishment of this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.275" offset="481915">Gregg was tried under a 1973 Law in Georgia that made some changes in our death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.770" offset="519949">It is interesting to note that only one offense and that of perjury was deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.729" offset="551819">The general assembly provided for a bifurcated trial under which at the first phase, you would determine guilt or innocence and that only.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.951" offset="596645">Then that same jury was to consider the punishment that would be imposed and we submit that in this area, we still have some of the arbitrariness and the discretion and that we do not meet the Furman standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.618" offset="675326">In the 1973 law, there were ten enumerated statutory aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.517" offset="714927">Those are set out and I believe they are set out in the brief for the respondent in that the appendix was not printed on the appellant's -- petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.665" offset="767486">Those are specified and referred to as the statutory aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.703" offset="795698">At this phase of the trial, the trial judge must determine which of those he will submit and in addition the jury, as I understand the law, can consider other aggravating circumstances to use the language as authorized by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.423" offset="882529">Nowhere does the statute make any definition of a mitigating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.158" offset="905517">It is completely silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.506" offset="918892">Now, in this case when we proceed, with the senates in phase and after instructions and these instructions are required to be carried out with the jury and the jury make its finding and indicate what the aggravating circumstances are.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.466" offset="998722">This record reveals that, if I recall correctly, some three were submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.163" offset="1025471">The jury returned its verdict and made its recommendation of death which was binding upon the court when that recommendation is made, so the substantive change in our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.070" offset="1077194">Before that the jury made its finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.740" offset="1091822">If it made a recommendation of mercy then only life sentence could be imposed, and if it returned the verdict of guilty in these cases then it was the automatic death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.560" offset="1135081">Now, then 73 law provide for an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.800" offset="1160054">This is in addition to our review, a statutory review.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.761" offset="1179907">This was in addition to the usual and normal appeal which was done in this case and it is submitted that, while this is desirable, it does not cure some of the discrepancies and arbitrariness of Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.151" offset="1257438">In this, the trial court is required to submit to the appellate court, his evaluation, shown on appendix B of the brief for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.407" offset="1322536">I would direct the Court's attention to this because it illustrates the effect of action in the trial court level on the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.381" offset="1366421">One of the issues in this case was, in this report says -- number seven on page 3B on the end, was an evidence of mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.824" offset="1428175">The trial court says no.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.686" offset="1443639">This removes from consideration, the evidence that was adduced in this case and where there was a written statement, exculpatory in nature taken at the time of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.157" offset="1505497">This removed and I submit removed it in the appellate level.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.812" offset="1532142">It must be remembered that in this case and I think, I would apologize for going into the evidence to this point, but upon arrest in North Carolina, Gregg made a statement to the Georgia authorities when they questioned him about what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.405" offset="1606434">It was exculpatory in nature and that he said there was a fight and he did it in self defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.823" offset="1632139">There was evidence in the record, including the lip of one Sam Allan and some evidence as to some abrasions on the hands of one of the victims, but Gregg was carried from Asheville down Inter State 85, past the most direct route to Lawrenceville.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.596" offset="1735270">Sometime before daybreak early in the morning in the presence of and after having been transported from Asheville to this area, with the District Attorney, the prosecuting officer in the back seat with and Gregg under handcuffs, the other passenger in that car being the Chief of the County Police of Rennet County and one of the detectives that, that in two hours turned around and proceeded back north to the scene and it is supposed to be that detective Barnett said that there was a restatement or reenactment of what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.871" offset="1896394">They also testified that the Chief of Police told Gregg that this is the way it happened, (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="457.724" offset="1935786">Gregg is supposed to have said yes, but this record reveals that Gregg refused to sign a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.766" offset="1979881">Gregg denied it on the trial of the case, but this removes entirely we submit, any consideration of the mitigation -- mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.161" offset="2033484">Now, where does that leave us?</text>
            <text syncTime="486.532" offset="2051038">I objected strenuously, tied to keep this evidence out, notwithstanding this, on the trial of this case when it was charged, the effect of the charge in this case is to submit to this jury the question you either acquit him or you convict him.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.224" offset="2137765">The lesser included defenses of manslaughter or even the statutory right of a jury to find and attempt, even if a crime was committed, affectively deprived the jury of any discretion, except you either find it as a murder or justifiable homicide, that is what the charge is in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.019" offset="2280916">Yes sir, Mr. Chief Justice, but also as a matter of right, I think a jury, at least in Georgia, has a right to convict of a lesser included offense, particularly in a capital case.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.555" offset="2427097">There were two people who were involved in an incidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.781" offset="4683972">Whatever a man has done, he pays his penalty and we submit the Court that there is a real Eight Amendment issue and that is not to be tested, but what a General Assembly thinks is to be tested by an interpretation of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.665" offset="4795567">I would submit that a more proper test and I submit that this Court has consistently held it when you take away a right that the burden not necessarily be upon the person accused.</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.282" offset="5041954">I submit in conclusion Your Honor, that the Weems case and the Robinson case and really the Dulles case show that this Court can take and can consider any punishment imposable under the judicial system in this country today and you can place it in the ballots of does it meet the test of the Eight Amendment, without any apology to anyone, anywhere and that is where this comes down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.988" offset="5208825">The bottom line is, is it justified or had the government proving that it is such a punishment, has it proven that there is such a deterrent that in 1976 that we will continue to impose the death penalty under such conditions when we do not know for sure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.698" offset="5527623">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.133" offset="5541416">I argue on behalf of the state of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.154" offset="5557507">Briefly at the beginning, I was to address a few of the comments made by Mr. Harrison as to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.141" offset="5593452">I do not wish to re-argue the case factually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.046" offset="5613096">The jury determined beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Gregg was guilty of two murders with malice or in the commission of an armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.263" offset="5665967">Mr. Harrison has intimated that another man involved in the crime for somehow arbitrarily and capriciously not sentenced to death, but given a sentence of ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.144" offset="5717481">Mr. Harrison has failed to point out that the other man Mr. Allan involved was 16 years of age and could not have been punished by death in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.898" offset="5760426">Additionally, there was no evidence to indicate that he had any prior knowledge of Mr. Greggs planning to kill this two men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.439" offset="5814656">In response to this Court's decision in Furman, the General Assembly of Georgia in 1973 enacted a new procedure, a new death statute procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.322" offset="5858124">In doing so they allowed controlled discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.441" offset="5882679">In complying with this Courts decision in Furman, they eliminated arbitrariness and capriciousness on the imposition as this Court had held was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.783" offset="5928028">They eliminated that from the imposition of a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.819" offset="5944119">They did that in several ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.098" offset="5953210">First, they set out ten aggravating circumstances by statute and as Mr. Harrison says, they are also provided any other aggravating circumstance allowed by law, otherwise allowed by law which simply means any other way in Georgia law, you could find an aggravating circumstance and that to my knowledge is only one other place and only one aggravating circumstance which would be a prior conviction, which is not included in the first statutory aggravating circumstance which provides for prior capital convictions and prior convictions of serious criminal assault brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.825" offset="6116214">In other words, the District Attorney could present an aggravation and say a prior burglar, however, before death sentence can may imposed, the jury must determine beyond a reasonable doubt, the presence of one of the statutory aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.420" offset="6194581">It is true that the general assembly did not define mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.125" offset="6213389">They said mitigating circumstances as otherwise provided by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.622" offset="6231362">Again, they are referring us back to the general Bifurcated Trial Act which allows that open to the defense counsel to permit him to present evidence of any factor which could legally be considered in mitigation not barred by the constitution rules of evidence and some other general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.375" offset="6322372">They provided in a very important part of the procedure for swift and immediate appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.477" offset="6362810">This review was directed to include an examination of the record by the Supreme Court of Georgia, an examination of a trial report which is included, the trial report in this case by the trial judge is included in appendix B to respondent's brief, to determine the presence of any passion prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.682" offset="6471584">Second, they were mandated by the general assembly of Georgia to determine whether the evidence in fact supported the aggravating circumstance found and third, to examine other cases, to determine whether the senates imposed in that particular case under review was disproportionate, to the senates imposed in other similar cases considering both the crime and the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.228" offset="6597807">A third thing that the General Assembly did was to provide for a bifurcated trial procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.953" offset="6616720">They did not do this under this Senate's Act, but it was done before.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.811" offset="7416067">My recollection is they found two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.849" offset="7424217">Three were submitted to them, they refused to find number 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.763" offset="7455878">A number looking specifically now at the ten statutory aggravating circumstances in Georgia, they are set out at pages 28 and 29 of respondent's brief, a number of these aggravating circumstances have been attacked either by petitioner or amicus on behalf of petitioner as being overly broad, as being meaningless and I want to look at the few of those now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.033" offset="7564965">They attack number three, which says that the act of murder and armed robbery or kidnapping, knowingly creating a great risk of harm or death to anyone in a public place by means of a weapon and so on and endangering the lives of more than one person, that could fit many things, but to understand the Georgia of death statute, one must look at the bare wording of the statute in light of the refinements added by the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.365" offset="7678336">The case of Marcus Wayne Chenault versus State, this was the statutory aggravating circumstance was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.107" offset="7709265">What Mr. Chenault did was to avenues of bad discharge in Atlanta on a Sunday morning during a worship service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.144" offset="7737478">He sprayed the congregation with gunfire, killing two members of that congregation and if I recall correctly wounding others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.269" offset="7769974">Now, the jury had no difficulty in finding statutory aggravating circumstance number three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.178" offset="7797559">On the other hand and the Supreme Court of course had no difficulty in affirming it as being supported by the evidence, however, on the other hand in the case of Joe versus State, it was a case in which the defendant abducted a woman at gunpoint in a shopping center parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.375" offset="7874359">The state sought aggravating circumstance number 3, the Supreme Court of Georgia said no.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.353" offset="8042274">Under Georgia’s procedure of the Supreme Court play such a major role that to understand them one must view, the refinements added by the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.091" offset="8089190">Another statutory aggravating circumstance, they attack as being meaningless and over broad is number seven which involves torture and depravity of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.072" offset="8133180">In the case of McCorquodale versus State where McCorquodale tortured a young woman for several hours by use of acid, fire, surgical scissors, kept her alive, it is amazing the woman lived as long as she did, finally breaking her limbs and stuffing her into a trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.604" offset="8215309">The jury found aggravating, statutory aggravating circumstance number seven.</text>

            <text syncTime="2053.574" offset="8319172">Again, the question is overly broad, what is torture?</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.121" offset="8345399">In the case of Floyd, Floyd in of the home, forced the mother and the daughter who was present to march up and down stairs trying to force from them the location of money, separated them, threatened the mother with cutting fingers of the daughter, walked them together and knelt them down, put the gun to the daughter's head, kissed her goodbye and blew her brains out in her mother's presence and then turning to the mother, blew her brains out, laughing that she put up her hand to shield from the bullet, he thought that was humorous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.003" offset="8488864">The jury filed torture, aggravating circumstance number seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.510" offset="8518852">They also attacked and interestingly so the aggravated battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.205" offset="8553647">They cite the case of Mitchell versus State to support the misuse of that and I think one of the law professors they quote, makes the remark that aggravated battery could apply to any one in -- any one murdered that displays simply a base misunderstanding of Georgia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.176" offset="8641523">Not so and it has never been used in the State, in that manner and again the misunderstanding is demonstrated by Mitchell v. State, they cited, to make the statement cited Mitchell v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.379" offset="8694395">The facts in Mitchell, Mitchell entered the grocery store, took the proprietor who was a middle age lady and her young son back to the cooler.</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.161" offset="8801497">He killed the son, but he did not kill the mother, even though shot three times, once in the back, the shoulder and the head, she lived to testify against him at his trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2349.701" offset="9503669">The General Assembly determined not to eliminate the Authority of the jury of the trial judge to bring to bare in a case, the community values and their first hand understanding of the facts in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.711" offset="9571692">They wanted to allow the Judge, the jury, the fact finder to tailor make the punishment to the defendant in that particular case, keeping in mind and reiterating the principle set down by this Court in Witherspoon and in McGautha and at the same time eliminating arbitrariness and capriciousness from the procedure and of course they did that with the statutory aggravating circumstances, but very importantly with the appellant review which mandates as I have stated earlier, the specific review by the Supreme Court of Georgia, for the presence of any arbitrariness factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.879" offset="9744413">They enunciate passion, prejudice or any other according to statute arbitrary factor, the Court is to examine in detail the record, the trial report which is a number of pages law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.731" offset="9803763">In the trial report there are six questions which deal with whether race was in any way an issue in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.925" offset="9832603">Second of course the in-depth determination of whether the evidence supported the aggravating circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.687" offset="9899580">The third standard and the third thing mandated by the general assembly was to compare this case with the other cases and the statute says other similar cases considering defendant, considering crime and of course the Court has the power, if it finds any of that to vacate the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.468" offset="10002712">This is in addition of course to normal appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.115" offset="10021311">That was the mechanism or at least a principle mechanism which was placed into the Georgia death penalty procedure to ensure non arbitrariness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2494.101" offset="10081288">In brief, they point to two cases as being a prime example of arbitrariness on behalf of the Supreme Court of Georgia, they point to the case of Coley, Coley was a rape case, an escaped felon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.118" offset="10145340">He was robbing a store, abducted a woman right there and was apprehended.</text>

            <text syncTime="2517.171" offset="10173553">The Supreme Court of Georgia vacated, just proportion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.555" offset="10195078">The case of Coker, an escaped felon, who goes out and enters a home, rapes a young woman who had given birth three before in the presence of her husband, abducts her and he is apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.170" offset="10257563">He has sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.582" offset="10267176">The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.827" offset="10288178">What petitioner does not point out to the Court that Coker, the second case had brought convictions for rape and kidnapping, one instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.044" offset="10449092">It would seem apparent to anyone of common human understanding, while Coker’s, death sentence was affirmed and Coley’s was vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.699" offset="10495695">If I understand the arguments of petitioner and the arguments made yesterday and earlier, what is being complained out under the Eight Amendment is arbitrariness in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.236" offset="10549820">Now, as I understand the case of Furman, it did not say that discretion was unconstitutional, but that arbitrariness or system which led to arbitrariness in fact are the wanton and freakish imposition of a death sentence was what was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.645" offset="10643443">If so and if that is the way I understand and I was listening to the way he used the word arbitrary, or arbitrariness and he said spared for no meaningful basis without rhyme or reason, without justification, no rational basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2662.701" offset="10755665">Has arbitrariness in fact been demonstrated to any degree?</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.531" offset="10774996">We maintain that what must be of avoided as is the wanton and freakish imposition, not that everyone who should get a death sentence under a system of justice or concept of justice, that a few escape or have they even shown any one escaping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.124" offset="10849393">It is interesting to note some footnotes in their brief where they try to bracket and compare cases in Georgia and say and one prime one is Gregg, this case, two cold blooded murders and an armed robbery, Gregg sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.890" offset="10912400">They cite the case of Brandon v. State, two cold blooded murders and of course of an armed robbery, sentenced to life imprisonment by the jury, imprisonment by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.680" offset="10963600">What they failed to note is that Brandon was fourteen years of age and I seriously ask this Court in considering those cases, in those briefs to look below the surface facts shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.117" offset="11037370">In almost every case cited, you will see the circumstantial evidence appearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.692" offset="11059626">You will see the felony murder appearing, not the malice murder, felony murder, confused evidence as to who was the perpetrator, the youth, the question about middle capacity, they appear in every case cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.127" offset="11141337">The statutory aggravating circumstances in Georgia with the appellate review has led to a group of criminals who have committed horrible, veil, heinous crimes being sentenced to death.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.681" offset="11331613">Of those that have been docketed and have been decided by the court, there are three for rape, one of which is Coker I discussed with this prior, the other two was rape and kidnapping together, a woman who was staked out over five dead, they also had prior capital felony convictions, those are the only verdicts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.011" offset="11408936">Any for robbery, I know for these robberies death sentences were set aside as an comparability basis and that would imply that there are no death sentences for robbery, although the statute does provide for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2842.253" offset="11473928">Looking to fine line added by the Court, the Court had said that that a death sentence for armed robbery in Georgia, in other words, if you took the facts of Gregg, eliminated the two murders, that is disproportionate and a death sentence cannot be imposed, they are none in Georgia that are armed robbery without murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.258" offset="11637873">The General Assembly of Georgia of course determined that a death sentence is justified in Georgia and it is needed in Georgia, of course, for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.558" offset="11687087">For deterrents, specific deterrents and general deterrents, we have some of those under death sentence now, who are under life sentences for capital crimes, and committed more capital crimes on escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.661" offset="11747483">So we have the problem with specific deterrents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.921" offset="11760544">The General Assembly of Georgia as matter of policy has determined that there is a general deterrence by the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.462" offset="11790741">We respectively submit that the constitution does not demand that the balance of fear weigh more heavily on the citizen than on the potential capital criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.055" offset="11869109">We think that petitioner has not demonstrated arbitrariness or capriciousness in Georgia statutory, what is happened under Georgia’s death penalty statute.</text>
