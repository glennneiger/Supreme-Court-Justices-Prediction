            <text syncTime="30.124" offset="223854">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.358" offset="236706">This case comes up before this Court on an appeal from a decision of a Three-Judge District Court in Puerto Rico which in a divided opinion declared unconstitutional the citizenship requirement of Section 689 of Title XX of the Laws of Puerto Rico annotated.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.016" offset="307341">The pertinent part is printed in italics on page 10a in following of the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.296" offset="332523">Appellees are resident aliens who applied to the Examining Board of Engineers in Puerto Rico for Registrations as Licensed Engineer even though -- and even though they were non-citizens they did not attempt to establish their eligibility under Section 689 by demonstrating that they had studied the total courses in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.054" offset="419563">The Examining Board denied them the application and appellees, instead of availing themselves of the review established by law in Section 701, immediately repaired to the Federal Courts and applied under the jurisdiction of the Civil Rights 1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart 1343.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.127" offset="503782">It should be noted that Section 689 has never been construed by the Local Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.954" offset="527188">Under the Courts of Puerto Rico are courts of general jurisdiction empowered to grant all remedies which can be granted by the Federal Courts and or course that review can finally be granted to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.239" offset="576298">Appellees are at present, as far as I was able to ascertain, working for the government of Puerto Rico or its municipalities under a special license as provided by Section 689 of that very same law.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.975" offset="639201">This case is of the utmost importance to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and it has great significance because it raises two very important issues to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.160" offset="683922">Whether Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act and its jurisdictional counterpart, Section 1343 are applicable to Puerto Rico and second, whether the District Court should have abstained from passing upon the interpretation and validity of a statute which had never been construed by the Commonwealth Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.033" offset="967508">It should be noted that at present, the misuse of Section 1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 1343 in the Federal District Court of Puerto Rico has literally flooded the Court with all conceivable types of cases in which every facet of government action and decision making, whether major or minor is being questioned to the point where there is a real question as to who is really running the government.</text>

            <label>Ms. Miriam Naveira De Rodon</label>
            <text syncTime="248.493" offset="1097284">I believe so sir because in Puerto Rico, the civil rights actions that are being filed are not being filed, let us say like in the prisoner’s cases or in racial discrimination cases or in certain definite type of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.938" offset="1151096">In Puerto Rico, they cover every government facet.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.425" offset="1164993">For example, I will give you an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.639" offset="1173875">The removal of employees, the approval of probationary periods, the transfer of employees, the disciplinary actions instead of going through the administrative processes available in law, they will repair to the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.836" offset="1230717">The Federal Court will assume jurisdiction and there will be a trial of complete -- this thing will be seen in the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.989" offset="1267289">If the government announces of a policy that it plans to drill oil in the outlying skirts or that it plans to mine copper, immediately we get an action in Federal Courts and the court does assume jurisdiction and the whole procedure goes on. And I think that if one examines the types of action that are being filed, one finds that there is definitely a difference between the 50 States and Puerto Rico.A</text>
            <text syncTime="318.910" offset="1378988">ppellees invoked the District Court’s jurisdiction, solely on the basis of Section 1343 and Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act and we submit that neither apply nor were intended to apply to Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.579" offset="1437607">Our arguments are based on the Carter case which was decided by this Court and declared the neither Section 1983 or it jurisdictional counterpart, 1343 were applicable to the District Court of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.020" offset="1491419">Now, in the case of the Commonwealth as well as in the case of the District of Columbia to determine whether a statute is applicable, one must examine not only the words, but also the context, the purpose and the circumstances in which the words are being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.875" offset="1558815">Sections 1983 and 1343 have their roots in the Ku Klux Clan Act of 1871 when it was first enacted to cover just dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.858" offset="1598730">It was not until 1874, when the substantive measure, that is when 1983 was amended to include territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.685" offset="1634048">No such amendment was made to the jurisdictional part.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.371" offset="1648781">It was in 1875 that the District Courts got general jurisdictional over Federal questions and it was until 1898 that the United States acquired Puerto Rico after the Spanish-American War.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.423" offset="1704997">Ever since the very beginning, in the Insular Cases, Puerto Rico has been considered an unincorporated territory not intended for statehood and this Court in Carter said when expressing its view on the territories covered by Section 1983 that they were applicable to territories in a transitory nature in the process of becoming a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.335" offset="1804680">In 1952, the people of Puerto Rico and the people of the United States enter into a compact and thereby created a new sovereign entity with the the Federal political structure, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.736" offset="1862254">Now, as stated in Carter, the Section 1983 was designed to apply to states and to territories which were in the process of becoming a state. Puerto Rico is neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.879" offset="1922858">Furthermore, the conditions upon which Section 1983 had intended to correct whenever present in Puerto Rico, the courts of the island have always been able and willing to vindicate the civil rights of individuals and have the power and the procedural mechanisms to grant all remedies that may be granted by Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.071" offset="2011570">We submit that in the absence of a more definite guidance from Congress, Section 1983 and 1343 should not be held applicable to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.998" offset="2063292">On the abstention question, we think that this Court in Calero-Toledo case rendered an abstention doctrine which was quite wide and liberal for the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.501" offset="2117313">Citing from the Wock (ph) and Hawk opinion it stated, “do you regard to the statutes of the Commonwealth under its compact to the United States dictate that it should have the primary opportunity through its courts to determine the intended scope of its own legislation and to pass upon the validity of that legislation under its own as well as under the constitution.”</text>

            <text syncTime="528.969" offset="2219191">Yes, of course the only alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.218" offset="2232148">In this case where the statute and question has never been construed by the courts of Commonwealth and where it may very well be interpreted in such a way as to avoid the constitutional question, abstention with it would be very appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.109" offset="2291811">Section 689 does not contain an absolute prohibition against non-citizens obtaining licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.880" offset="2318874">What is meant by total courses has never been interpreted by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico and could very well be interpreted to mean courses directly related to the peculiarities of a poor, overpopulated small tropical island, subject to such tropical hazards as earthquakes, hurricanes and flash floods.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.425" offset="2409049">The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has been reluctant to attribute to the legislature an intention to pass a statute raising constitutional problems, especially when the legislative intent is not clear as in this case where there is practically no legislative history to go upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.896" offset="2478953">It should also be noted that the constitution of Puerto Rico contains besides a general equal protection clause, a specific prohibition against discrimination on account of race, color, sex, birth, social origin or condition or political or religious ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.323" offset="2560664">If a statute does not measure up to these constitutional principles and standards, the courts do not have to reach the federal constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.777" offset="2602459">As was recognized by this Court in the Calero-Toledo case, the relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico has been the object of numerous debates in international forums, especially in the United Nation where the creation of a Commonwealth in 1952, prompted the United States to seize transmitting information concerning Puerto Rico under Article 73(c) of the Charter which deals with non-self governing territories, thus recognizing that a new sovereign entity had been created within the constitutional structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.721" offset="2766195">Whether Puerto Rico has true internal self government is debated still in the international community, especially by the Third World.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.807" offset="2806528">Thus, that this be so, in fact, as well as in theory is important to both the United States and Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.716" offset="2842159">We submit, therefore, that the abstention in this case and the case of Puerto Rico is especially appropriate and in accord with the compact between the United States and Puerto Rico and with the difference that this Court has always shown to the courts of the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.290" offset="2908510">As this Court rightly pointed out in the Fornaris case, the relations of the Federal Courts to Puerto Rico have often raised delicate problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.246" offset="2952291">This is especially true today, when the misused of Section 1983 and 1343 has produced a fantastic increase in a number of cases filed in the Courts of Puerto Rico and has led to an ever increasing intervention of the Federal Judiciary into practically all aspects of governmental functioning and even minor decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.818" offset="3054587">But even more disturbing than all this is the fact that federal juries had been handing down incredibly high amounts of damages in cases of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.781" offset="3098473">For example, they awarded $250,000.00 in damages in a case involving the removal of a local government employee where a violation of Due Process was alleged based on a Federal Court’s interpretation of a local statute which had never been construed by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.895" offset="3246953">This case is actually on appeal before the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.359" offset="3264716">It should be borne in line that the language requirement of Federal Jury service in Puerto Rico makes the Federal Jury a very selective one for a large portion of the island's inhabitants are not sufficiently bilingual as to enable them to qualify for jury service, Spanish being the native tongue.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.173" offset="3360010">Under Section 1983 and 1343 as I have already told this Honorable Court, some purely local matters are taken before the court and the court does assume jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.108" offset="3419779">All these cases which I am talking about are normally taken directly to the Federal Courts bypassing the administrative procedures available and the local courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.964" offset="3463142">We even have the situation where those cases which are pending, applications for dismissal are made and people repaired to the Federal Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.609" offset="3521761">It is just that they prefer the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.836" offset="3534717">The congestion of the court calendar that has not sued has made it necessary sometimes to set cases for Saturdays and for after 5 o’clock during the week.</text>

            <text syncTime="1470.547" offset="5985526">They say under the Carter, the Civil Rights Act was found not to apply, therefore, it does not apply in Puerto Rico. I think this is a false syllogism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.673" offset="6018022">In Carter, this Court was also faced with a matter of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.902" offset="6034949">What was the scope of Section 1983?</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.324" offset="6048637">In trying to find this scope, it went back to the old case of Puerto Rico versus the Shell Company where it stated that it was the character and aim of a statute which serves to define the terms of the statute, specifically in Carter the scope of the term state or territory and the court asked, what was the purpose of the 1874 Amendment to Section 1983?</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.204" offset="6156157">And it found that it was the intent of Congress when it amended the Civil Rights Act to extend the Fourteenth Amendment protection to the territories acting under Article 4 of the Constitution of the United States, territorial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.914" offset="6223031">The reasons for this, that is like reasons for Congress in passing this amendment were that it had experienced certain difficulty in controlling what were then far flung territories and Congress had delegated some of its lawmaking powers to territorial legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.443" offset="6289068">Therefore, these two factors combined to make the territories more like states in so far as problems of Civil Rights jurisdiction were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.189" offset="6332118">Therefore, they equated territories with states in so far as Section 1983 was concerned. The District of Columbia on the other hand in that case was found to be under the direct control and supervision of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.422" offset="6393036">It is the seat of national government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.349" offset="6400768">Therefore, the reasons that Congress had in extending Fourteenth Amendment protection to the territories did not exist in the case of the District Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.696" offset="8034153">Second, I do not think the proper solution to the language problem would be to say that there are no more civil rights in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.990" offset="8059335">The solution is to say, well, let the District Court in Puerto Rico conduct its proceedings in Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.209" offset="8108131">Now it is my contention, the contention of plaintiffs in this case that after 1952, if anything Puerto Rico became more like a state than anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.098" offset="8159749">I should point out that since 1952, not a single Federal Statute that had been held to apply to Puerto Rico before 1952 has ever been held inapplicable to post 1952 Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.152" offset="8211890">In other words, to hold now that Section 1983 does not apply would be the first time that this Court or any court as far as I know has held that a Federal Statute applicable to pre 1952 Puerto Rico is inapplicable to post 1952 Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.675" offset="8297989">Going back again, also to the Shell Company Case, we have to find -- we have to look at the intent of Congress in 1952 when it granted Puerto Rico the power to draft its constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.730" offset="8350234">I think it is quite evident that Congress was very concerned that the constitutional rights, United States Constitutional rights be preserved in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.800" offset="8386492">After 1952, the joint resolution approving the constitution of Puerto Rico provided that the constitution would not go -- enter into effect unless it conformed with the applicable provisions of the constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.908" offset="8470920">Section 2 of the Federal Relations Act which was continued in effect by Public Law 600, equates Puerto Rico with the state of the union in so far as the rights, privileges, immunities of its citizens are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.058" offset="8523583">It is interesting that this is the same language used in Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.986" offset="8547302">When Congress was studying the proposed constitution, it required an amendment to the proposed Article 7 to the effect that the applicable -- that no subsequent amendment to the Puerto Rico Constitution would be passed that did not conform to the applicable provisions of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.175" offset="8639984">The conference report to Senate, 3336 which later became Public Law 600, stated that this matter that is that the proposed Puerto Rico Constitution and Public Law 600 would be a “Fundamental contribution to the art and practice of the government and administration of territories under the sovereignty of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.637" offset="8737891">In other words, Public Law 600 in the constitution of Puerto Rico are merely a further step in the administration of territories under Article 4 of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.324" offset="8784598">Finally, on this point, it is also clear from the legislative history surrounding Public Law 600 that the changes brought about by the law where only matters of “purely local concern,” this is a quote from the committee report to Public Law 600.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.112" offset="8859726">So in concluding on this point, the argument of the Commonwealth that leads to the conclusion that Congress advocated its responsibility under Article 4 that it just withdrew Section 1983 protection from post 1952 Puerto Rico is contrary to all the legislative history surrounding Public Law 600.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.473" offset="8957215">Now, if this Court finds that Puerto Rico is a state or territory within the meaning of Section 1983, then the substantive matter presented to the Court or in this case, like some of it has already been decided by the case of In re Griffiths, nevertheless, the Court, I mean, Commonwealth is arguing that it is entitled to a broader or more liberal test regarding its justification for the discrimination against aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.428" offset="9085006">I should point out that the discrimination here is not against just these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.880" offset="9102874">It is not a personal discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.455" offset="9109144">It is an across the board discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.764" offset="9134430">The justification presented by or the reasons why the Commonwealth thinks it should be entitled to a broader test or more liberal tests is first of all because of its special position or rather because it is different from the state or the union and second because of the specific factual situation existing in present day Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.525" offset="9225441">On the first point, the position of the Commonwealth, it is my contention that constitutional uniqueness or uniqueness under the constitutional scheme or in the constitutional scheme is not the same as exemption from the requirements of that constitutional scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.729" offset="9290224">The test of a justification should not be the position of the governmental authority imposing the discrimination, but rather the effect of that discrimination on the person being discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.928" offset="9335050">The aliens in this case do not care whether, I do not know, the Federal Government or a territorial government or the government of something called the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that is denying them equal protection of the laws, they are still being denied equal protection of the laws and the effect is that they are being denied their right to work, to exercise a profession solely because they are aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.021" offset="9435361">In their brief, the Commonwealth cites or refers to general unemployment figures in Puerto Rico, but it does not cite what it should cite which is the unemployment figures for engineers in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.835" offset="9486665">They do not cite general per capita income, I mean, they do cite general per capita figures, they do not cite per capita income figures for engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.700" offset="9526162">The reference to illegal immigration I believe is completely irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.728" offset="9542254">No showing was made that immigration tends to be among professionals or engineers or any a thing of the sort and I am sure this Court will agree that no such showing could probably be madeParenthetically, the Commonwealth in its brief seems to say on page 20 that the states have the right to regulate what they call the influx of aliens through their boarders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.744" offset="9646326">I submit that this is incorrect, going back at least as far as Hines versus Davidowitz in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.513" offset="9681330">On a matter of employment or engineers in Puerto Rico just 10 days ago, the President of the University of Puerto Rico, Dr. Arturo Morales Carrion was quoted in an interview in a local newspaper to the effect that in his opinion the orientation of education at the University of Puerto Rico should change from what it has been in the future and is now from liberal arts towards sciences and engineering because Puerto Rico needs people trained in Sciences and Engineering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.112" offset="9799821">There is a lack of this type of training in Puerto Rico and the whole university orientation should shift toward this type of training.</text>

            <text syncTime="2496.687" offset="10090094">This is abundantly evident in the committee report to the amendment to the engineering statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.531" offset="10125411">The committee reports said that other countries have requirements similar to the requirement being considered in this amendment, that is they require that people coming to work in these other countries be citizens of the country and that the purpose of the amendment wants to conform the law of Puerto Rico to the law of these other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.884" offset="10214855">That is the only reason put forth in the Committee Reports on the amendment for the amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.218" offset="10268249">The matter of Civil Code responsibilities were used by the Commonwealth in their brief is also false issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.379" offset="10292804">If we look at the statute we find that aliens who receive their education in Puerto Rico are entitled to unconditional licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.451" offset="10325091">Yet the Commonwealth forgets these aliens are just as free to live Puerto Rico as our aliens who have studied elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.232" offset="10360304">The same is true as to United States citizens who have received their educations in States or the Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="2574.525" offset="10401473">The statute contemplates reciprocity agreements between Puerto Rico and the States of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.699" offset="10422162">These United States citizens from other states are just as free to live Puerto Rico in case of trouble as our aliens who have studied elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.972" offset="10463227">I cite the case of Empresas Capote versus Superior Court in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.856" offset="10482766">In this case, there involved a question of the meaning of the term contractor in the Civil Code Chapters concerning Civil Responsibility for construction defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.331" offset="10528637">The Supreme Court stated -- the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico stated that the term contractor is not limited to professional engineers or architects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.107" offset="10563746">It means anybody who has promised to produce a certain result or to render a certain service and the fact is that in Puerto Rico there are very many people who practice the professional as I might call as that of contractor, that is they put up buildings, they put up whole buildings and they are not engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.523" offset="10653398">If we are going to require some contractors to be citizens and others not, I understand there is a violation of Due Process of the law, excuse me, of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.997" offset="10723302">In summary, if I may, in borrowing the abstention question, this Court I think has three courses open to it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.414" offset="10752977">It can affirm the judgment in the District Court, state that Section 1983 applies and that is the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.763" offset="10790384">Secondly, it can state that only the Fifth Amendment applies to Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.117" offset="10811805">However, this I think would have the effect of equating Puerto Rico with an old time territory, subject to direct control by Congress under Article 4 and limited then by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.709" offset="10862169">I do not think that even the Commonwealth would have agree to go this far or it can determine that neither the Fifth nor the Fourteenth Amendment applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.234" offset="10896233">This I think would result in I think intolerable constitution vacuum in Puerto Rico because it would be the same as saying that Puerto Rico is independent country which is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.013" offset="10935416">It would be the same as saying that U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico are in the same position as your citizens residing in say France.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.865" offset="10994766">Finally, the Commonwealth request that if the Court finds that Section 1983 does not apply, oh! No that is my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2829.699" offset="11422130">The Commonwealth Courts have not had the opportunity of interpreting what is meant by how sturdy the total course, whether this means to have gone through the three years of University in Puerto Rico, whether these are topping of courses necessary to practice engineering Puerto Rico, this has never been interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.585" offset="11505617">My colleague interpreted to me the whole three years in Puerto Rico, I do not know how the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would interpret that case in particular whether it is speaking about going through the entire university or just some specific courses which would qualify the alien to practice law in Puerto Rico to unique circumstances of Puerto Rico itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2886.321" offset="11648559">We are just contending that Section 1983 and 1343 are not applicable which is a statutory construction.</text>
