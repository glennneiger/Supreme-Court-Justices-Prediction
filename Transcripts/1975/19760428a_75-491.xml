            <text syncTime="61.110" offset="347762">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.143" offset="359882">This case is here on the Government’s petition to writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which had ordered a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.409" offset="404918">On the afternoon of September of 24, 1971, respondent and the decedent James Sewell checked into a Northwest Washington Tourist Home, registering as man and wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.311" offset="452565">About 15 minutes later, three employees of the Tourist Home heard screams emanating from the room occupied by Sewell and respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.504" offset="485375">Upon forcing open the door of the room, they discovered its two occupants on the bed, Sewell lying on top of respondent and both holding onto a knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.412" offset="524976">There was testimony showing that respondent’s hand was on the handle of the knife and Sewell’s on the blade.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.937" offset="551099">After two were separated, police and an ambulance were called.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.334" offset="568653">Sewell was taken to a nearby hospital where he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.781" offset="582446">Respondent in the meanwhile had slipped out of the Tourist Home in the confusion and disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.682" offset="610031">The evidence showed that Sewell had had some $345.00 in cash on his purse about two hours before the fatal incident, which money was not found on his person or in the room after the stabbing.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.419" offset="664993">An autopsy of Sewell revealed that he had been stabbed numerous times in the chest, abdomen and back with a knife, including a stab wound of three-and-half to four inches in depth into the heart and another that entered just above the navel and penetrated about five-and-half inches into the liver.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.031" offset="739389">There were also cuts on the palms of Sewell’s hands of a kind, according to the medical examiner, that might be received one trying to defend himself from a knife attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.188" offset="780036">Respondent turned herself into the police the next day at which time a physical examination of her disclosed no cuts, wounds or bruises on her person.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.136" offset="815876">The prosecution’s theory at trial was that Sewell had gone to the bathroom, down the hall, and upon return to the room had found respondent riffling through his clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.384" offset="856836">In the ensuing dispute, respondent took the knife and repeatedly stabbed Sewell causing his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.578" offset="885571">The defense contended that respondent, who did not testify as to what had transpired, may have acted in self defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.207" offset="912111">Counsel based his argument to this effect on the fact that it was respondent’s screams that the Motel employees had heard and the fact that when they broke into their room, Sewell was lying on top of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.232" offset="956206">The Jury found respondent guilty of second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.454" offset="973133">In the course of preparing for trial, respondent’s trial counsel had interviewed a witness who advised them that he believed that Sewell had been arrested a number of times and possibly convicted for assault with a knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.455" offset="1021094">After consulting with another attorney who was a former teacher of Criminal Law and an experienced practitioner, counsel concluded that any criminal record Sewell may have had would have been inadmissible in evidence in support of respondent’s claim of self defense because it was not known to respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.725" offset="1090162">He, therefore, made no further effort to discover or use information on this subject. As some three --</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="257.776" offset="1134361">Yes, he so stated in his affidavit in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.492" offset="1153273">Some three months after respondent was convicted, the Court of Appeals decided a case called United States against Burkes in which it stated in dictum that evidence of prior specific acts of violence by a deceased would be admissible in a homicide case to support a claim of self defense, even if not known to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.140" offset="1231850">When counsel learned of this decision, he checked the prosecutor’s case file and found that it did contain Sewell’s criminal record which consisted of two misdemeanor convictions in 1963; one for carrying a knife and one for simple assault with a knife, this was eight years before the homicide, and another misdemeanor conviction in 1971 for carrying a knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.201" offset="1328085">He there upon brought this motion for a new trial on a basis of newly discovered evidence which has led us here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.381" offset="1356820">The District Court denied respondent’s motion for a new trial on the basis of alleged prosecutorial suppression of the evidence of Sewell’s criminal record and subsequently also denied a second motion for new trial, based upon the allege ineffectiveness of respondent’s trial counsel in pursuing this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.755" offset="1426305">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.021" offset="1435396">While it expressly refused to find that the prosecutor had engaged in deliberate suppression, it concluded that the element of prosecutorial misconduct in the absence of a defense request for the non-disclosed evidence in this case, were much less significant in assessing a new trial motion than the materiality of the undisclosed evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.572" offset="1533616">Well, yes it was before the Court of Appeals on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.417" offset="1545006">When this matter came out it was remanded to the District Court for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.402" offset="1564963">The motion for a new trial was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.019" offset="1575412">It was then -- the trial counsel then moved to have himself remove as counsel, a new counsel was appointed and was re-amended I believe to the District Court for a second hearing on the ineffective assistance of counsel point, but I believe it was on direct appeal rather than collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.742" offset="1642286">I do not think it would really make any difference though to the disposition of the case.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="400.107" offset="1703726">I mean, is the case before the Court of Appeals in the posture of an attack on the judgment of conviction or a claim that the trial judge erred in denying the motion for a new trial on a basis of newly discovered evidence?</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="414.622" stopTime="552.619">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="414.622" offset="1761822">The later, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.932" offset="1783033">Now, the Court of Appeals held that a new trial is required whenever, irrespective of the blame worthiness of the prosecutor’s conduct, the undisclosed evidence might have led the jury to entertain a reasonable doubt about a defendant’s guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.852" offset="1834756">It concluded that this evidence came within that category and thus a new trial was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.289" offset="1856490">In so ruling, the Court was essentially following the precedent established by the District of Columbia Circuit nearly ten years earlier in the decisions in Levine against Katzenbach and Levine against Clark, from which the Chief Justice, then a Circuit Judge vigorously dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.613" offset="1917721">In the view of the majority of those cases, the absence of a defense request and the lack of defense diligence in discovering evidence, subsequently claim to justify a new trial are factors to be given little or no weight in deciding the new trial motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.590" offset="1977698">The mere fact that the prosecutor possessed evidence that might have been helpful to the defense was alone sufficient to require a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.482" offset="2013224">The dissent effectively expressed the contrary view, which is our view, that those factors are critical, that is prosecutorial breach of duty and defense diligence and that their abandonment is difficult to justify either in logic or in terms of the impact of such a ruling upon the fabric of our adversarial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.593" offset="2101727">At the heart of this and like cases in our view, there is the need to choose between these two analytical models, the one propounded by Chief Judge Basil on Eleventh, the clear tendency of which is to impel the Government toward an open files policy in criminal cases and the one upon which the Chief Justice’s dissent was grounded, which seeks to define a duty of disclosure within the context of the adversarial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.817" offset="2202560">Now, before turning to further discussion of these analytical models, let me stress the salient facts of this case, which in our view conclusively demonstrate the error of the Court of Appeal’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.920" offset="2246968">First, the defense knew that Sewell probably had a criminal record, but it chose not to pin down the details of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.434" offset="2277061">This was not evidence within the prosecutor’s exclusive possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.399" offset="2292944">It was equally available to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.341" offset="2300676">They simply had to subpoena the Police Department to get it.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.093" offset="2879654">I mean, had they gone to the prosecutor and asked this, there is nothing in this record to suggest that it would not have been given.</text>

            <text syncTime="711.438" offset="2949035">They could have gotten from either the prosecutor or the Police Department I think before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.179" offset="2968052">Now, the second point is that both the defense and the prosecution believe that the record was not admissible in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.373" offset="2996787">Thus, even if the prosecutor had disclosed the record to the defense, it would not have been used at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.955" offset="3023118">Now, thirdly, this view of inadmissibility was quite reasonable at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.139" offset="3039837">It was only as the result of a dictum in a case decided three months later that it appeared likely that such evidence might have been held admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.229" offset="3068258">And indeed today, I think six judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals have indicated in their opinions, on our petition for re-hearing that they would probably view this evidence as inadmissible and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the local Court has stated that such evidence would be inadmissible if not known to the defense.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="767.699" offset="3174106">Well, we asked them to and -- I cannot answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.361" offset="3188735">They were four votes for re-hearing en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.740" offset="3202318">But, we needed five (Inaudible) to secure. Now, finally, even if the defense had known of the evidence and of its admissibility, there were good tactical reasons not to use it and these are addressed in a last section of our brief and respondent has not really answered them.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.150" offset="3275879">The evidence would have tended to show Sewell’s familiarity with a knife, and therefore, enhance the implausibility that respondent could have -- had he attacked her first succeeded in inflicting such grievous wounds upon him and escaping totally unscathed herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.462" offset="3357172">Now, if a new trial is going to be required on the basis of evidence such as this, we think there is a very little left to any principal of finality of judgments in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.274" offset="3400431">Turning to the analytical framework; in our view cases like this can and should be approached analytically in much the same manner as any motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.958" offset="3451109">The first ingredient in every such case is the question whether the evidence is in fact properly characterized as newly discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.796" offset="3482456">It is uniformly been held that evidence known to the defendant or discoverable in the exercise of due diligence, cannot supply the basis for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.109" offset="3515788">There is no reason to depart from that simply because of Brady claim was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.476" offset="3533238">Indeed, it is highly inappropriate to do so because the heart of the Brady claim relates to evidence in the exclusive possession of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.729" offset="3566256">Now, let us assume, however, that at the evidence of Sewell’s criminal record can properly somehow be treated as newly discovered or that the requirement of new discovery can be dispensed with, Court must next consider in any new trial motion on the basis of newly discovered evidence, what the proper standard is for assessing the sufficiency of the particular piece of evidence to warrant a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.949" offset="3659148">Now, ordinarily when the evidence is simply uncovered and it was unknown to anyone prior to the trial, the standard is whether the evidence would probably result in a different verdict on re-trial, this is an ancient and nearly uniformly followed standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.464" offset="3729156">That standard fully accounts for the balance that we have struck in our system between the undeniably important interest that convictions of innocent persons not to be permitted to stand, and on the other hand, the interest in the finality of judgment survive that after fair trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.798" offset="3802508">No one seriously suggests that respondent can meet that standard in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.467" offset="3821211">If she is to get a new trial therefore, it is not because of concern that she maybe innocent, but because of other policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.501" offset="3853290">Now, to sharpen the focus, the question is what bearing does the fact that the prosecutor possessed the particular piece of evidence in question here, have on the standard to be applied, in determining whether the evidence supports a new trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="952.603" offset="3913685">The Court of Appeals plainly believed that that fact alone sufficed to justify a new trial in the most generous possible standard, that is whether the evidence might have affect of the jury’s verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.956" offset="3963109">We say that that fact standing alone has no effect, that further questions must be asked, that is did the prosecutor’s failure to disclose constitute a breach of duty on his part?</text>
            <text syncTime="977.405" offset="4012950">Only if that question can be answered affirmatively, is there any justification to depart from the normal standards for awarding new trials on the basis of newly discovered evidence, because only then can it be said that the trial that did take place was in effect with unfairness and only then can it be thought that the award of a new trial might serve a useful function in shaping future prosecutorial behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.423" offset="4120993">Now, this analysis that I am propounding, some of the commentators have suggested that it is inconsistent with certain language in this Court’s decision in Brady against Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.555" offset="4169580">Specifically what the Court said in summarizing its holding was that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process, when the evidence is materialized to guilt or punishment and here are the important words, “irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.016" offset="4251396">Now, in Levine against Clark, the majority took the view that that language meant that the more generous standard of awarding a new trial as not to turn on prosecutorial misconduct, but simply to turn on consideration of whether the evidence might have helped the defendant, had not been introduced at the original trial and we think that is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.681" offset="4350034">First of all, the language applies only when there is a defense request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.815" offset="4366544">The defense request in some sense maybe viewed as taking the place off or imposing an additional duty on the prosecutor, and therefore, relieving the Court of the obligation to make a determination about his subjective state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.625" offset="4421819">In any event, we think what that language means is that you judge the prosecutor’s conduct not by having to find subjective bad faith, not by having to find willful misconduct, but by looking at the known facts and determining whether objectively viewed, those facts show a departure from his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.965" offset="4507187">This is the same standard that is used in conventional negligence law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.100" offset="4523696">It is still requires that he had a duty to disclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.074" offset="4535608">If he had no duty to disclose that he breached, it is simply pointless to award new trials by virtue of what turns out then to be a wholly fortuitous fact that he had the piece of paper in his file that contained this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.393" offset="4596839">Now, if we agree thus far that the prosecutor must have breached the duty of disclosure, we next suggest that the presence or absence of a meaningfully specific defense request is a central importance in defining the prosecutor’s duty of disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.862" offset="4670713">Now, let us be clear about what I am contending here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.957" offset="4687118">If the prosecutor has willfully suppressed evidence, acted with mens rea, a request would be unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.884" offset="4726824">Moreover as Judge Friendly has indicated in the Keogh case and has come to be generally accepted in the Second Circuit and a number of other Courts, if the evidences of such obvious exculpatory value that it could not have escaped the prosecutor’s attention even without a request, then, there would be justification in those circumstances for awarding a new trial, even in the absence of a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.077" offset="4827657">The case is cited by the Court of Appeals on page 9-A of the petition, in Footnote 10, are such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.800" offset="4862557">In the Hibler case, the prosecutor misrepresented the testimony that would be given in proposing a stipulation, although he knew that the person would not testify as he proposed in the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.620" offset="4913757">In Baldi, the prosecutor failed to disclose to the defendant ballistics evidence indicating, a finger print evidence indicating strongly that the defendant was not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.286" offset="4960464">In Meers against Wilkins which Mr. Justice Marshall wrote when he was on the Second Circuit, two eye witnesses known to the prosecution and not known to the defense had failed to identify the defendant and the prosecutor had not disclosed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.611" offset="5029740">In Pool, it was a rape case and there was evidence, medical evidence that in fact the complainant had not had sexual intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.272" offset="5076447">Now, when we are talking about that kind of evidence, we do not doubt that the prosecutor has a duty of disclosure to the defense even in the absence of a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.191" offset="5112078">Although, if the defense already knew about the evidence, we do doubt that a new trial would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.483" offset="5145202">But most situations do not involve that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.552" offset="5157531">As Judge Friendly said in Keogh, that is the rare case when the prosecutor acts with that kind of gross negligence or callous disregard for fair play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.308" offset="5196506">The normal case is a case like this in which the prosecutor who naturally is an adversary looking at the file from a certain prospective who is not familiar -- he does not know what the defense knows, he does not know what the defense is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.121" offset="5259827">He does not know what information is likely to be important to a defendant and what information is likely to be of no interest at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.857" offset="5290756">In that situation, it is awfully easy for him to make a mistake, for him to fail to appreciate the exculpatory utility of a piece of information in his file, unless he has had the benefit of a focused defense request which calls his attention to that kind of information, which therefore elevates his duty to examine that kind of information with care to look at it from the prospective of a defendant and to see whether so viewed, he can perceive its utility to the defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.072" offset="5635572">But I think in most cases, the defendant can anticipate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.858" offset="5654694">I know it has been suggested how can the defendant know what is in the prosecution’s file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.058" offset="5679562">In our view, all you have to do is to think to think about civil litigation and think about a lawyer of minimum of competence preparing a series of written interrogatories for a witness and you will see that it is quite easy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3099.947" offset="12503060">And furthermore, you see what has happened in this case, with the permission of the Court, there was a reference to the fact that well we all know that it was Sewell’s knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.380" offset="12548826">The Jury knew nothing of the sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.089" offset="12563664">Now, as I have said, he knew, we had the prosecutor who knew we had a knife issue and in the pre-trial, he conceded to the defense attorney, well, it looks like you are right, it is Sewell’s knife you will see that on page 848 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.537" offset="12625417">The first witness that he called in the case was Sewell’s wife, the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.711" offset="12650181">He asked her did your husband carry a bowie?</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.176" offset="12668049">“No never!” and he took pains to have it demonstrate to the jury the length of the knife that he did carry, indicating that it was merely a penknife and it was a penknife that was found in his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.133" offset="12727817">This prosecutor having conceded prior to trial, not only they had a knife issue, but apparently he was going the other way, then went into the trial, having concealed some very eloquent evidence as to knife carrying from the defense, went to the trial and then developed for the jury evidence from which they certainly must have concluded, taking the invitation of the prosecutor that this knife was not taken into that room by Sewell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.821" offset="12846622">He then asked the desk clerk, “did observe any weapon?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.654" offset="12865953">And that the desk clerk said “No”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.367" offset="12876820">Now, these were the first two witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.085" offset="12883611">Then later in the trial, he brings in another person who was in the motel, Griffin, brings him from the lock up, asks him some very brief questions, one of which was whether or not you observed the weapon and he said “Yes he had.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.144" offset="12951843">And, then he also asked him another question with respect to the position on the knife and proceeded to discredit his testimony on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.751" offset="12978279">The only evidence before the jury in other words that Sewell the victim carried a knife was from a witness discredited by the prosecutor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.890" offset="13362906">Your Honor, there are two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.314" offset="13368549">First of all, I think it is with difference, an invalid behavioral assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.960" offset="13399164">I think prosecutors and defense attorneys will both try to win cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.830" offset="13418599">I think that defense attorney with the limitation of resources and time and astuteness will do its best to uncover evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.991" offset="13447229">And I think you can -- I think we count on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.408" offset="13456947">In any event if you suspect that the defense attorney will seat back, waiting then until after trial to raise the Brady point, the answer is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.558" offset="13505535">Had the prosecutor combed his file before trial and if there is anything remotely helpful, disclose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.979" offset="13547226">It sounds the problem perfectly for the Government, and there is no way it seems to me that will impose if we require that impose any undue burden on the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.942" offset="13583066">And in fairness, it should be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.384" offset="13592888">Why again should the Government be allowed do withhold the exculpatory material?</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.369" offset="13612741">So this was I think is clear from the case law admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.630" offset="13629878">I think when you fully consider the issues in the case and what was going through, it had to be going through the mind of this prosecutor, he was talking about this issues with the defense that he knowingly withheld admissible, helpful evidence that he was callously indifferent and that if the defense had had this issue or had had this evidence, it would have change fundamentally the whole character of this trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.570" offset="13845544">Just one or two things Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.546" offset="13857456">First of all on the claim that this evidence was admissible, the Evans case was completely distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.386" offset="13884833">What was held in Evans was the testimony that the deceased became violent when drunk as he was at the time of his death was admissible to show his character for violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.277" offset="13944392">That is not an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.473" offset="13949198">The question here is how do you show character for violence?</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.353" offset="13960692">Can you show character for violence by isolated specific acts?</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.836" offset="13978664">I wonder if the defendant or indeed the Court of Appeals would be taking the same view if we were trying to show that the defendant was the aggressor by means of one or perhaps it is two -- that is not what the opinions indicate, simple assault convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.851" offset="14042717">In any event, we have discussed that at pages 6 to 9 of our brief and I think it is plain that the evidence was inadmissible in the District of Columbia at the time or certainly was not plainly admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.484" offset="14093290">Now, what the prosecutor said in argument to the District Court and there is not basis for assuming that he was lying, he explained to the District Court, this is at page 148 of the appendix, there was nothing in this case which indicated to the prosecution that the record of the decedent was in anyway favorable or usable by the defense in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.980" offset="14175210">In fact, I would say quite frankly to the Court that the Government’s position prior to Burks was that the prior record of the decedent was not admissible in evidence unless the defendant herself knew about that.</text>
