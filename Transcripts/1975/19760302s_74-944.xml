            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="10.338" offset="114942">Petitioner is a publisher of the Time Magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.627" offset="132079">That magazine published an article which purported to describe respondent’s divorce from her husband, a member of one of America’s wealthy or industrial family.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.566" offset="175860">Respondent, claiming the article was both false and defamatory, brought a liable action in a Florida Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.393" offset="203236">The jury awarded her damages in the amount of a $100,000 and this judgment was ultimately affirmed by the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.244" offset="234583">We granted certiorari to consider petitioner’s contentions that this decision infringed its rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.501" offset="267602">For the reasons expressed in an opinion which has been filed with a clerk this morning, we reject petitioner’s arguments that it was entitled for the protection of the standard announced by the court in New York Times versus Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.158" offset="318280">We conclude respondent was not a public figure within the meaning of our decisions and we disagree with petitioner’s claim that the New York Times privilege should automatically extend to articles which are reports of judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.613" offset="380033">We hold instead that the proper standard of constitutional protection to be applied in this case is the one we announced two terms ago in Gertz versus Robert Welch.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.881" offset="425173">Our review of the record is satisfied as the two of the elements required by Gertz.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.269" offset="446698">First that the published report be false and that the damages be supported by competent evidence have been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.045" offset="473760">As to Gertz’s third requirement however, it appears that there has never been a finding by another state courts which have considered this case to the effect that petitioner was at fault in preparing and publishing its report of the respondent’s divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.994" offset="529558">We therefore remand the case to the Supreme Court of Florida in order that this essential element maybe considered and resolved in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.312" offset="562890">Mr. Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion in which Mr. Justice Stewart has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.636" offset="584206">Separate dissenting opinions have been filed by Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.611" offset="616076">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
