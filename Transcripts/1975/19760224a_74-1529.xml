            <label>Mr. Joel Lewittes</label>
            <text syncTime="41.972" offset="271173">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.565" offset="281622">This case involves the granting of a federal writ of habeas corpus to the State Prisoners by the United States District Court from the Northern District to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.382" offset="320805">Wherein, the District Court vacated a 1965 plea of guilty solely on the ground that the relater, that is the responded here, was not informally advised of each legal element of the crime to which he pleaded, where the plea was otherwise unassailable and where the responded admitted the act charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.150" offset="411920">The second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed to that opinion, the granting of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.848" offset="442745">Turning to the facts for a moment, the crime was committed on the night of April 6, 1965, where upon Mrs. Ada Francisco, a widower, who owned the farm where the respondent was working, was brutally murdered in her home in Fulton County which is an up state rural community in New York State by an assailant who stabbed her more than 40 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.346" offset="552668">The respondent Morgan was convicted of that murder which occurred while he was working on the victim’s farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.170" offset="575969">Mr. Morgan at that time was 18 years old and the record varies as to his intelligent “From a range of 40 to 75”.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.233" offset="620273">It is noteworthy as we will refer to later on that at the time of sentence there was psychiatric report on the basis of the psychiatric examination of the Utica State Hospital that the defendant, the respondent in this case, was competent to stay in trial, was able to understand the nature of the charges, and would able to assist in the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.210" offset="736152">The underlying altercation which resulted in the commission of the crime here, was no doubt the fact that the respondent originally was a resident of the Rome State Hospital which a division of the New York State Mental Hygiene Department for Young Defectives, Mental Defectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.393" offset="820893">Apparently --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <text syncTime="182.598" offset="833746">He was there as patient, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.025" offset="839388">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.408" offset="844926">And apparently his record was good enough so that he was released out to various farms and particularly in this case to the farm of the decedent where he worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.966" offset="895186">And apparently his will, there was a rule on the part of the Rome State Hospital that those that were released would have to be home by 10 o’clock at night, each night, and the respondent violated those rules and Mrs. Francisco, the decedent, told the respondent that he must not to do that again.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.217" offset="996227">He must not violate the rules but yet he did, and she said, “Well, I am going to have to tell the people of Rome State Hospital.”</text>
            <text syncTime="230.114" offset="1023813">And the respondent fearing no doubt that he would be returned to the State Hospital sat according to the record bruited about it, and decided that he was going to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.243" offset="1068325">He went up to Mrs. Francisco’s room with a hunting knife in his hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.226" offset="1092253">It was not a pocket knife as the record reveals; it is was a hunting knife 5 inches long, went into the room, awakened her.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.142" offset="1127884">The decedent screamed and thereupon the respondent stabbed her approximately 44 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.084" offset="1159649">He ran away with a small some of money, fled in the decedent’s car, drove about a hundred miles away was involved in a head on collusion with another car, and was taken into the hospital whereupon he was arrested based upon the description of the respondent that they were looking for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.827" offset="1238644">They did find the hunting knife in the car and confessions were made, the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.744" offset="1286291">He was arraigned about nine days afterwards to the crime of murder in the first degree at which time the Judge at the arraignment proceeding assigned to him two counsel, two lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.569" offset="1349612">The indictment, murder one, was read to him in open court.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.891" offset="1362882">He was advised that he was entitled to a Jury Trial and have the right to subpoena witnesses, on his behalf to produce any evidence, necessary for the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.033" offset="1399453">The Attorney’s at the time of the arraignment requested that the respondent be examined psychiatrically.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.282" offset="1436443">This was granted by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.390" offset="1448877">The Attorney’s also informed the Court that they would moved at that time to obtained copies of various statements made by the respondent to the police into the District Attorney’s office.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.165" offset="1496002">That was on April of 1965, on June 8, 1965 respondent in fact pleaded guilty to murder on the second-degree upon the recommendation of the District Attorney and the request of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.175" offset="1552009">Defense counsel was present at that time, those were members of the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.111" offset="1567786">The Trial Court was quite aware of the limited intelligence of the respondent and the record shows, the plea minutes too demonstrate, the solitude taken by the Trial Judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.027" offset="1627450">Mr. Lewittes, does the New York make what I think of as a customary distinction between the first-degree murder and the second-degree murder that first degree would require a predisposition as well as intent, while at second-degree intent would be sufficient without predisposition or premeditation?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Joel Lewittes</label>
            <text syncTime="397.588" offset="1693697">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.292" offset="1700489">That is way statute read in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.045" offset="1711460">It has subsequently had been changed Your Honor, but at that time, murder in the first degree required premeditation and deliberation with intent, a murder in a second just required an intent to affect the design to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.297" offset="1792544">The respondent at the time of plea, admitted he had consulted with his attorney and that he knew that he was going to go on the prison, and seven days later, the sentence was imposed and ended termed 25 years to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.595" offset="1865687">The actual minimum amount under the statute for murder in the second degree at that time was 20 years to life.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.713" offset="1898183">There was a plea for leniency on the part of the defense and before passing sentence, the Court did note as it is required and was required of that time in New York State that prior to sentence, the Trial Judge must have before he may present his report in a social history report, and he did have the report of the psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.588" offset="1985641">It is noteworthy as well that at the time of sentence there was no surprised or disappointment either by defense counsel or by the respondent when the sentence was pronounced.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.208" offset="2032139">Well, all was quite for five years, and five years after the conviction, Coram Nobis application was commenced by this respondent, and for the first time, he now alleged this his plea was involuntary because he was unaware of the consequences of the plea, and he was unaware that intent was an element of murder in the second-degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.619" offset="2113746">Supreme Court in Fulton County denied the writ without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.744" offset="2134330">It determined that indeed it was voluntary that he did have counsel that he had spoken to counsel about it, and it was voluntarily and knowingly made.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.405" offset="2188978">The State Coram Nobis denial was affirmed unanimously without opinion by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in New York State and leave to appeal was denied by the New York Court of Appeals on July 6, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.629" offset="2257837">Then following the procedure that is quite familiar in my office, the State inmate then proceeded by way of federal writ of habeas corpus, it was time in the District Court, in northern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.106" offset="2315724">And he raised the same issues that he raised in the State Coram Nobis proceeding, they had failed to ascertain, the Trial Court failed test ascertain the factual basis for the plea and that he was not told with the elements of the crime to which he pleaded where the consequences of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.414" offset="2385001">The District Court denied the federal writ of habeas corpus not unlike the decision in Coram Nobis that actually tracked the decision of the State Coram Nobis within State Court termination, and District Court held that the plea was indeed voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.269" offset="2464413">A certificate of probable cause was granted by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and they reversed or remanded on they say without any request for opposition by the State to put in opposition papers on the certificate of a probable cause --</text>

            <text syncTime="2930.250" offset="11824296">But he could better understand the intellectual deficiency of the accused and could recognize as I think he did recognized based upon at deficiency, that he accused did not know that intent was an element.</text>

            <text syncTime="3135.166" offset="12644018">It has got come to him by someone who is in a position that to tell him this is the element.</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.939" offset="12711101">They attempt to set the plea aside on the grounds that it was not explained to them that to commit this crime, you will have to have to put life in danger, you have to use a dangerous weapon and put life in danger, and there are certain presumptions as to whether a weapon is dangerous, whether ti is loaded or not.</text>
