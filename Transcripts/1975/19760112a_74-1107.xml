            <text syncTime="40.363" offset="264805">This case presents dramatic features of both fact and law, but it can be decided on a narrow basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.204" offset="312139">Factually, this case presents a contest between two endangered species.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.566" offset="341605">On the one hand, the individual farm operator of the United States whose numbers decline no less than 40% between the years 1959 and 1969 and on the other hand a species of fish known as cyprinodon diabolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.529" offset="429481">Cyprinodon is also known as pupfish and it inhabits the Death Valley Area of Nevada and California.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.363" offset="476815">There are many species of pupfish, five of which in 1970 were declared to be endangered.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.738" offset="510251">Cyprinodon diabolis has a life span of approximately one year and at maturity it is almost one inch in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.089" offset="551629">Its numbers have been stabilized for several years now at several hundred.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.444" offset="585066">Legally, this case presents a contest between two disparate rules of law, both formulated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.854" offset="626757">The first which was in effect between the years 1935 and 1955 laid down that the Congress by the Desert Land Acts, no later than 1877 severed the land and the water in the Western Arid States and then territories and ceded all jurisdictions over nonnavigable water in the public domain to those states and territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.612" offset="753712">The other which was first espoused in 1955 by this Court and later extended and expanded laid down that when the United States reserved a land in the public domain, it could also reserve water if there was intent to reserve water and such intent could be implied.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.226" offset="928210">Does this means jurisdiction to the term on the rights of the waters under state law, is that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.178" offset="5479995">Now, as Nevada says and Nevada is an arid land state indeed, I hope this Court will reaffirm the earlier doctrine and sharply limit the implied reservation doctrine, but as counsel for the Cappaert, I need not and I do not go that far.</text>

            <text syncTime="1771.883" offset="7190806">As it has been indicated, I am representing the State of Nevada and I think the assertion by the United States Government that Nevada's concern in this and I think the concern of several western states is indicated by the briefs that were filed on amicus capacity is that it is substantially broader in our eyes than the conflict between the rancher and pupfish at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.924" offset="7275025">And if there is a substantial conflict, not only a present conflict, but a real potential for future conflict then that conflict is the State, Federal conflict in the use and management of water in all the Western States, particularly a state like Nevada, but there are many others that fall in the same category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.941" offset="7339077">Nevada happens to be that drives all the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.602" offset="7369693">Mr. Allison would you expand on that a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.295" offset="7380455">It is difficult for me to see why the states are so exercise in this case, is it because of the Taylor Grazing Act</text>

            <label>Mr. George Allison</label>
            <text syncTime="1826.876" offset="7410862">No, not necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.299" offset="7420475">The principle, historically the states have controlled the determination of water rights for use in a particular the states and the principle that has evolved is that, and that includes the United States government as I think one of the Justices indicated earlier, except in the case where Congress expressly indicated otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.039" offset="7507515">Everything else was left historically to the prerogative of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.611" offset="7521726">Now, this principle resulted in a great deal of certainty in determining water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.456" offset="7545131">A certainty in determining the water rights in those states was probably, well probably still is, not then, but is now the single most important factor in the development, the economic development of those states and the certainty only came because the states were allowed to determine those rights unless Congress expressly indicated otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.147" offset="7619946">Then when you insert not an expressed -- an expression of Congress, but an implied right considered it a later time in the reservation, right away you begin to raise havoc with the certainty that the states have established in determining those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.477" offset="7685252">It is at this point that the states become concerned because the reservation, or position of the government as I understand it is the mere act of reserving the land, but nothing further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.916" offset="7726944">No consideration of the circumstances, the need, the extent of injury, the importance of the water, the mere act of reserving the land automatically establishes the priority for the water date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.684" offset="7774068">Now, that water right may not be ascertained by the United States Government for 20 years in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.718" offset="7798206">In the meantime, the state of Nevada is granting rights to many adjacent property owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.660" offset="7821925">So they begin using these adjacent water rights for 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.417" offset="7836971">Suddenly 20 years later, the government says we have a water right and our priority date is the date we reserve it even though at that time we did not know we wanted it and that is what is causing us concern and I think the magnitude of that is amplified if I might quote just one or two short statistics is that in the state of Nevada for example and in fact, I am think in 11 of the Western States, where 61% of the land and 11 of Western States that is federally reserved land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.529" offset="7937386">Right now in the state of Nevada, you cannot have a major ranch unless it is either next to or part of federally reserved land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.582" offset="7965598">You simply cannot have it because there is so much Federal reserved lands, 76% of the state of Nevada is federally reserved land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.756" offset="7990362">All major sources of water in the State of Nevada come from Federal reserved land and that includes underground water which is charged by water from runoff from federally reserved land and that is why the magnitude of the problem is so severe to Nevada and this is true of all the other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2003.192" offset="8116064">That is my understanding of Arizona’s position and I assume that is true and I do not find that hard to believe because if the Justices are familiar with the State of Nevada, the three populations or I should say two-and-half population centers that we have are located in areas where there is access to water right next to federally reserved land and the underground water is just becoming a major source of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.353" offset="8208746">That simply is enough other water and there really is enough underground water, but without that there is no other development in the state and I think Arizona is essentially the same problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2068.918" offset="8378960">There is an existing case in the state engineer’s office and there are some other ramifications to it, so I do not pretend I know all the facts, but there is a river, the Carson River that runs out of the Sierra which is a federal reserved forest, that river runs down through and into water holding area in Lake Lohontan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.795" offset="8450535">Carson City which is our capital, does not have any other source of water right in the moment and there is a moratorium on building in Carson City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.989" offset="8479270">As a result of that, the City Council of Carson City went to the next county to try to get water from wells. The wells happen to be next to the Carson River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.043" offset="8515528">The government has protested that and if you track that out, the only legal basis they have to protest that is that the river is going to go down because Carson City is pumping water to supply its people and the basis for that is that the Carson River comes off the federally reserved land, and therefore, they have the right, the priority to the use of that and make then control --</text>

            <text syncTime="2950.814" offset="11906535">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.276" offset="11920432">The United States brought the suit to prevent the Cappaerts from extinguishing Nevada's on the population of cyprinodon diabolis, the Devil’s Hole pupfish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.764" offset="11958362">We contend in this case the Devil’s Hole National Monument was established in 1952 to protect to the pool that has been referred to and the fish in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.732" offset="11990232">That the water right of the United States is measured by reference to that purpose and that the Cappaerts pumping of water must be regulated to ensure that they do not interfere with that United States Water Right, a Federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.792" offset="12038506">I think I will tell the Court a little bit about the facts of this case and particularly the circumstances that exist at Devil’s Hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.062" offset="12063584">At the center of this case is an anomaly, a fish that lives in the desert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.881" offset="12082810">The area involved, Southern Nevada near the California border and not very far from Death Valley was not always once the desolate place that it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.112" offset="12119799">Thirty thousand years ago it was cool and wet, streams, lakes, rivers abounded and in fact Death Valley itself was a lake more than 100 miles long more than 600 feet deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.043" offset="12175492">This was the home of the ancestors, the pupfish that live in Devil’s Hole today, but the climate gradually changed, the glaciers to the north receded, the land dried and the animals of the area which included the (Inaudible) all disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.385" offset="12232857">Somehow however, the pupfish managed to survive, taking refuge on what one writer has called Tiny Islands of Water in the sea of sand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.124" offset="12271832">Of the four remaining species of cyprinodon, the Devil’s Hole pupfish has been isolated the longest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.211" offset="12296178">The scientist that testified in this case estimate that this fish entered Devil’s Hole approximately 10,000 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.980" offset="12323241">Between in then and now, this tiny fish which has Mr. Lionel pointed out is but one inch long has performed nothing short of an evolutionary miracle, evolving to its present status, present condition today, adapting to extreme circumstances in what is evolutionary-wise a blink of the eye.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.550" offset="12397533">The pool in which cyprinodon diabolis now resides is the smallest sole natural habitat of any species on the face of the earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.251" offset="12432328">The fish themselves make up the smallest population of the species of fish known to man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.787" offset="12458450">The surface of this pool which we have been talking about measures 10 feet by 65 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.055" offset="12479557">It is open to the sky, but it is 50 feet below the surrounding land surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.058" offset="12499515">All but the western end is bordered by sheer rocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.256" offset="12512367">The water temperature is a constant 92 degrees Fahrenheit year round.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.178" offset="12532011">The entire structure of Devil’s Hole and the pool was once a limestone cavern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.117" offset="12551760">The geologist testified that years ago the roof of the Cavern collapsed, perhaps by the dissolving action of the water inside, sending rocks down to the bottom as Mr. Lionel said more than 200 feet below, divers have gone down to at least 200 feet in Devil’s Hole, but no one knows the exact depth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.673" offset="12626052">But one piece of rock, not very much larger than this table here, about 9 feet wide at its widest and perhaps 16 feet long wedged below the surface of the pool to form a natural shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.631" offset="12677879">In the summer months, sunlight reaches the shelf and about one half of the pool itself only for a few hours a day allowing algae and other small organisms to grow there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.604" offset="12725735">In the winter, they are only shadows and the alga dies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.948" offset="12739110">The pupfish as the District Courts specifically found are totally dependent on this natural shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.418" offset="12760948">They spawn there, they feed there and when the alga dies, a great part of the pupfish population dies with it, only hopefully to recover again the following spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.911" offset="12802953">It is a precarious existence, but the pupfish have been successful for it for 10,000 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.714" offset="12826150">These fish, remarkable fish are unable to tolerate extreme temperature changes and ranges in salinity up to six times that of seawater, but ever since the first study of them began in 1936, they have been subjects of intense scientific interest.T</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.234" offset="12888217">here are dozens of studies in this either in the record in this case or referred to by the witnesses in this case and all of them relating to the pupfish.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.586" offset="13625706">No, I do not think that is conceivable and I will explain why later in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.423" offset="13649007">Because of their vulnerability, there have been numerous attempts to raise the pupfish to transplant them between 1947 and 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.109" offset="13679727">There were 10 attempts, all the, failed, There is a reference in the record here to a later attempt at Hoover Dam which at one point looked like it might work, but all the scientist testified that they could not qualify it as a success.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.267" offset="13736361">It started out with 24 pupfish, by the time the case had reached, June 1973, there are a 170 pupfish in this small aquarium in the Hoover Dam and I notice and I distributed to the Court the latest report of the special master which has attached to it a report of Dr. Deacon which points out that the pupfish population at Hoover Dam is dwindling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.256" offset="13816295">It is now down to 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.001" offset="13827371">One reason for this is population threshold and I think this is important to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.662" offset="13845970">The minimum population needed for specie to survive indefinitely, 24 cyprinodon diabolis may not be enough and the scientists have testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.360" offset="13880766">In breeding occurs because of the lack of genetic variation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.909" offset="13894976">The past inter fusion is an example as one of the biologist testified in this case, although thousands of them were left after they have been haunted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.457" offset="13929144">They were below their minimum population threshold level and despite efforts to preserve them, they died off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.685" offset="13958088">That was the testimony in the record that some scientists believe they are blue whale for example has reached that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.228" offset="13980240">The threshold level of Devil’s Hole pupfish obviously cannot be known until it is too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.866" offset="14006780">The testimony in the record, some scientists believe that it was somewhere between 100 and 200 fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.320" offset="14036560">As I stated earlier, the natural shelf at the Devil’s Hole is crucial to the existence of the pupfish and this of course is essential that it be covered with water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.603" offset="14073758">Despite the remarkable ability to adapt to changing circumstances, the one thing that the pupfish has not learned to adapt to is the absence of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.488" offset="14109285">At the normal level, the shelf is fully submerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.826" offset="14126630">It is 1.2 feet below a copper washer which is used as a marker and was installed by the National Park Service in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.496" offset="14161321">The Cappaerts began pumping water in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.905" offset="14182950">Yearly, they were taking out in this area 2 billion 281 million gallons of water for their ranch in the desert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.045" offset="14223492">The evidence that shows incidentally that some, but not all of their wells are hydraulically connected with Devil’s Hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.127" offset="14255779">As they pumped over the years, the water level in Devil’s Hole dropped and in turn the natural shelf began to be exposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.843" offset="14294650">In 1970, the natural shelf was 46% covered although it had been 100% before the pumping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.352" offset="14328713">By 1971, the shelf became only 21% covered with water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.446" offset="14349089">By June of 1972, when the first hearing of this case was held, the natural shelf was covered only with 10 to 15% with water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.235" offset="14388272">The usual summer population of pupfish at Devil’s Hole is about 700.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.442" offset="14409066">In 1961, it reached a high between June -- in June between 200 and 300 fish, less than half of that that had been in existence before the pumping started, it did slightly better in 1972 going up to about 400, but I notice in the latest special master's report that is before the Court now, that last year in 1975, the highest pupfish population reached was about 294.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.378" offset="14524841">The evidence shows, therefore, and the District Court found that it is necessary to maintain the water level at Devil’s Hole so it covers the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.268" offset="14552426">That is 3 feet below the copper marker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.539" offset="14565487">This is the only way to have a continuing viable population there and that is what the District Court ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.651" offset="14589938">Now, Mr. Lionel in his argument talked about being prevented from pumping on 21 square miles of his ranch that is not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.773" offset="14626405">Number one, with respect to the wells that were under the injunction in this case, he is not prevented from pumping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.809" offset="14654512">They are only pumping -- their pumping has to be regulated so they do not drop the water level between 3.0 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.165" offset="14680008">Mr. Lionel said in his opening statement and I quoted this that “the injunction in this case utterly destroys his business enterprise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3834.800" offset="15442470">Well, over a period of decades, there maybe a small effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="4597.811" offset="18494512">That is something worth protecting and preserving and President Truman did it in 1952 and that question obviously concerns the reservation doctrine and we discussed that somewhat, but under this doctrine, it is simply that the United States by reserving public lands may reserve the waters pertinent to the land, unappropriated waters and those reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes of the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4626.172" offset="18607988">Well, we submit that President Truman’s intent is clear from the face of the proclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.081" offset="18627632">Certainly, more so than -- there is not much to -- one talks about implied reservation doctrine, there is certainly very little to infer in regard to water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.934" offset="18663055">In President Truman’s proclamation, but the constitutional basis for the doctrine is hardly is startling one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.404" offset="18688968">It simply the property clause of the constitution, giving the authority to the United States to act under the Property Clause with respect to this land and the Court in Arizona versus California held that under this clause and I quote “there can be no doubt about the power of the United States to reserve water rights for its reservations and its property, that was 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.494" offset="18785308">In 1971, this Court held and I emphasize held, this was not dictum, in the Eagle County case that again reaffirming Arizona versus California saying that as we said in that case, the Federal Government had the authority both before and after a state is admitted into the union to reserve waters for the use and benefit of federally reserved lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.579" offset="18877677">The federally reserved lands, include any Federal enclave as what Mr. Justice Douglas speaking for the Court incidentally, who was from a Western State and he said also that the reservation of waters may be only implied and the amount will reflect in the nature of the Federal enclave.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.717" offset="18954163">Here however, as I have stated, there is very little to, if anything to infer, the reservation of waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.222" offset="18976210">Waters as mentioned, the pool of waters and Mr. Cappaert or Mr. Lionel has not really explained when he says in his brief that that proclamation did not intend to reserve one single drop of water, how you can preserve a pool of water without intending to have water in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.227" offset="19052175">Now, the fact that the government can reserve water rights as a matter of Federal Law should hardly be surprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.655" offset="19077984">After all, the Cappaerts are asserting a water right against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.103" offset="19091776">The only difference here is that their right supposedly arises under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.142" offset="19111838">We are saying that Federal right arises under Federal Law. None of the parties in this case in this case or the amici I might add have suggested that the United States cannot have water rights at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.863" offset="19154784">Rather the argument is that the United States should submit the state law and state procedures to establish them.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond Randolph Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5087.239" offset="20452233">And the United States is subject to that under the McCarran Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.342" offset="20460697">They could enjoin the United States if any at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.853" offset="20474699">As far as this uncertainty, the fact is that that is true under Nevada Law too.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.429" offset="20492984">If you got a water right, a permit to pump it may not be years -- until years later that you find out that you are interfering with somebody else down the road and that is not the reason for denying the United States the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.304" offset="20544498">Moreover the fact of this case is that hydraulic connection between the eight wells of the Cappaerts in Devil’s Hole was shown and shown conclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.075" offset="20575636">As a matter of fact, in June of 1973, the Cappaerts finally stipulated to the fact that they regulate the water level in Devil’s Hole by pumping from their wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.044" offset="20615446">I have already talked about condemnation as an argument and I think that it is adequately answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5133.766" offset="20638330">That it assumes the issue in the case, that is that they have a right as against the United States, even though they did not come on to this property until 1967 and starting pumping that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.615" offset="20677827">As far as res judicata which I notice is alluded to in the brief by both parties in this case, but was raised below, if it all anybody, the Nevada State of Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.074" offset="20723593">This decision of the state engineer was not res judicata with respect to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.673" offset="20746059">The state law requires the state engineer to decide this and give a permit for pumping subject to existing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.482" offset="20773226">This is a suit to determine whether the United States had existing rights and the state engineer when he decided this case said and you find at the very end of the proceedings, this permit is given subject to existing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.596" offset="20821709">Indeed the Cappaerts do not even have according to the record in this case any water right perfected in Nevada now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.237" offset="20852220">All they have is a permit to pump and so far as the record shows they are never gone back and got a certificate of appropriation which would give them a vested right under Nevada law. Moreover, there were only, out of the eight wells involved in this case, there were only two of those wells were pumped and drilled after this case was begun in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.019" offset="20939365">They were not even part of this proceeding before the state engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.154" offset="20959949">Beyond that their areas of the ranch that were not involved beyond that the injunction applies to future wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.828" offset="20982624">We do not think that the decision of the state engineer, an engineer trained in hydraulic mattes was an adjudication of the government’s right in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.568" offset="21021598">There was one mention of a Federal Order Right in Devil’s Hole, but that was not mentioned by Mr. Cappaert’s counsel, not by the government and as they said in that case at the time the government was conducting studies to find out the hydrology of the area and I think as even the Cappaert’s counsel said, no matter what we decide in this water proceeding now, this proceeding for a permit, those studies will go on, so there is no need to wait for them and they did go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.009" offset="21123371">And six months later, the United States determined that Cappaert’s were responsible for lowering the order level in Devil’s Hole and that is why we brought this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.221" offset="21160152">Therefore, we suggest and we submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.180" offset="21192021">Thank you.</text>
