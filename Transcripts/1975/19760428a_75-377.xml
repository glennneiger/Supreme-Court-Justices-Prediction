            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103361">We will hear arguments next in 75-377, Ludwig against Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.000" offset="323312">Mr. Hagopian.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Hagopian</label>
            <text syncTime="56.298" offset="328537">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.537" offset="349434">The basic underlying issue on the merits of this case is whether that a defendant in a criminal proceedings has a right to trial by jury when he is charged upon an offense on which he faces maximum prison sentence in excess of six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.688" offset="426025">In the instant case, the defendant Richard Ludwig was denied a right for trial by jury in the first instance and he was convicted on the first tier in the Massachusetts Court System and he took an appeal, whatever the word might mean, to the second tier in the Massachusetts System.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.001" offset="519335">At that time he presented a motion to dismiss, based on the grounds of double jeopardy and also on the grounds that his first trial was an error that there were errors in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.009" offset="575341">I do not know what type of motion to dismiss that is, but leaving that aside that is what Massachusetts calls it, some sort of a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.323" offset="616615">In the second tier proceedings he waived his rights for trial by jury and that was on my advice as counsel to present a mootness issue from arising.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.989" offset="659247">That decision took place prior to this Court’s decision in Costarelli versus Massachusetts and I exercise my best judgment as to what I thought the state of law was at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.949" offset="703132">Ludwig was convicted by a judge, eventually took an appeal to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which took the position that he was not entitled to a trial by jury in the first instance, that this Court has not made that clear in Duncan versus Louisiana or in subsequent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.572" offset="769588">They allege that they state of the law was in a flux.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.280" offset="792471">They did not apply the Fourteenth Amendment in the absence of any prior decisions by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.556" offset="825490">This case comes here on appeal and although the Commonwealth has not raised it, I think that there is somewhat of a problem in the jurisdiction of this Court, at least in view of Costarelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.015" offset="879407">In a certain sense, when Mr. Ludwig took an appeal from the first tier to the second tier, he vacated the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.236" offset="908246">Now, let me see if I can draw an analogy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.833" offset="918590">We will make it a little bit clearer what I am talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.077" offset="931652">In a single tier system --</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="209.011" offset="939384">At that point at the first tier, there were conviction and the sentence of imprisonment imposed and then a man took an appeal, does he go to prison?</text>

            <text syncTime="219.209" offset="980135">No, he does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.867" offset="982747">It is vacated automatically as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.957" offset="995181">The judgment is vacated, but that subject has several limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.425" offset="1008974">One is this; he also may lose his license which is in Ludwig’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.784" offset="1030394">Now, I would suppose that that is not part of the judgment in the sense that the judge does not write down on the complaint, but the statute says whoever is convicted down in the District Court, the clerk of the Court sends a notice to the Registry and the Registry yanks his license.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.656" offset="1085983">To me that is part of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.295" offset="1092461">It is a criminal punishment that is imposed upon him.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.665" offset="1121928">But his revocation exists of his license and that is an effect and that is penalty that is being imposed because he is convicted of a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.533" offset="1157454">That is not a civil sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.874" offset="1162783">It is a criminal sanction.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="265.989" offset="1167276">If he has not been convicted, if you set aside, whatever the jury may be, the Law of Massachusetts says that even after it is set aside, his license is revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.445" offset="1205101">Is that what you are telling?</text>

            <text syncTime="275.624" offset="1205833">That is quite correct and because it arises out of a criminal offense, it is not a civil sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.981" offset="1235194">It is a penalty that is imposed if you read Boyd versus United States and those forfeiture cases where they also take -- to forfeit the goods of an automobile because it has been used in a heroin case.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.840" offset="2210711">There are State Court decisions which hold that where the revocation is purely as a penalty for committing a criminal offense, whether that is road related or not, that he is entitled to all criminal rights that a criminal defendant has.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.487" offset="2273301">Now, there is one case I have cited in my brief up in the State of Alaska and they have held squarely that he is entitled to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.871" offset="2314783">If you are going to yank a man’s license for a year because that period of time is such a lengthy period of time and that is such a penalty that he is entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.615" offset="2349787">And right in this district here, the District of Columbia versus Colts because there was a fine imposed and I think there was maximum prison sentence of two months, but they talk about in District of Columbia versus Colts that that is a penalty in the context that it is being revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.683" offset="2414048">Now, I understand what you are saying, but there are a number of similar cases, I think three or four years ago, there was a case called One Lot Emerald Cut Stones which involved this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.430" offset="2469010">I think that was a forfeiture case.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.299" offset="2476533">Now, I suppose in these forfeiture proceedings, they can be civil in nature and only the civil burdens are required of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.398" offset="2516866">But where that impose in Boyd, in Klamath (ph) car case and I have cited those in my brief there are cases in this Court that hold that you must afford the accused criminal protection or criminal rights in this type of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.770" offset="2598368">One of these cases is One Lot Emerald Cut Stones versus United States as a footnote in that, I believe Mr. Chief Justice wrote that opinion and the other one is One 1958 Plymouth Sedan versus Pennsylvania and Boyd versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.104" offset="2663674">I have also cited in page 50 and 51, the Alaska -- the decision of Alaska Supreme Court on this particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.095" offset="2699723">But getting back to the jurisdictional issue again, let us take a single tier system.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.730" offset="2718218">If a man is convicted in a single tier system, at the end of the trial, he has the option, he may or the state may afford him to grant him a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.800" offset="2758551">He may make a motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.688" offset="2766074">The minute he makes that motion for new trial and it is granted, he does not have any right to complaint about what has happen before in the first trial and the de novo procedure is in same sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.963" offset="2819155">The fellow has an option to elect a trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.413" offset="2832948">Let us assume, and there are many jurisdictions, I think there are 16 jurisdictions in United States where you can get a jury trial in either the first tier or the second tier.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.104" offset="2867743">Now, at the end of the first tier, a fellow has that option to get another trial de novo by jury or by judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.112" offset="2891776">He does not have to exercise that option and to me, if the state does not grant him a right of Appellate Review with that stage of the proceedings, he has the right to come to this Court, in the United States Supreme Court either by Appeal or certiorari or he may go over to the Federal District Court by habeas corpus or if a fine is imposed he may go over perhaps under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.739" offset="2970248">I have a case where a fellow did not want to go to the second trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.985" offset="3051227">Instead of going for a trial de novo, we walked over to the Federal District Court under the Civil Rights Act, even though a fine was only imposed and are seeking a collateral attack on that first tier of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.061" offset="3091560">I think he is entitled to Federal Review of that conviction without going through the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.170" offset="3112040">That is -- in a sense that is the whole basis of the merits of this case, that an accused does not have to go through two trials. He has a right.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.375" offset="4048791">Yes, Your Honor, basically, but the underlying basis of that case is that the defendant in that case was deprived of due process and that is what is basically the argument, the bedrock of Callan is that in fact Mr. Justice Harlan in his words said, the defendant should not have to suffer the burdens of two trials and that is the bedrock of Callan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.844" offset="4134682">I would also like to say, I am not saying we should do away with trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.057" offset="4151505">All I want is the accused to have that right to have the option for jury trial in the first instance and that is not going to affect Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.764" offset="4182329">I do not believe that the compelling interest doctrine should apply to this case, but even if you do apply it to this case, Massachusetts can easily give the defendant the option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.633" offset="4221826">There are very few defendants that are going to exercise that option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.340" offset="4232693">There are certain instances where that option will always be exercised, but in those types of cases, the fellow is almost inevitably going to take the right for trial de novo anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.098" offset="4275743">There are cases that if you do give them the option, there will be a slight increase perhaps and very incontestable of the number of jury trials, but it is only going to be in those cases where the fellow has been deterred originally by the do novo system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.462" offset="4333108">And I do not think that the Commonwealth has any right to complain about that end result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.976" offset="5955208">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.275" offset="5976419">On behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I think that in a preliminary way, I would like to outline probably in an overview fashion the course I hope to pursue in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.295" offset="6036501">I would first touch on the jurisdictional situation that I think is appropriate to bring before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.302" offset="6072550">I then would proceed to a discussion of what, at least in the judgment of the Commonwealth, the Massachusetts Court said in a Ludwig decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.745" offset="6114241">I would then try to impress upon the Court what we conceive to be the notion of de novo procedure in Massachusetts and what is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.744" offset="6158336">Thereafter, I would try to evaluate that particular procedure in the light of what this Court said in Duncan and Louisiana, stating at least minimally that our position if that Duncan and Louisiana stated a right to trial by jury rather than a mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.600" offset="6241719">Then trying to establish to the Court what the mode of delivery of that right is in Massachusetts and whether or not it fulfills the basic concept, a constitutional concept of jury trial as has been enunciated by this Court and finally, hopefully to discuss the double jeopardy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.972" offset="6327191">Proceeding in that outline, I would like first of all in a jurisdictional way to ask this Court to consider that the record before it constitutes a petition for certiorari, rather than an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.664" offset="6405977">The Commonwealth does that fully knowing that we have not briefed it, but in preparing for the particular argument, I was referenced to the decision of this Court in Costarelli where this subject matter was raised by footnote and also in reviewing the brief of the Commonwealth from a Costarelli case, it was footnoted there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.288" offset="6492494">I think it is significant and I would suggest to the Court that if we got this procedure, this review a certiorari rather than appeal for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.838" offset="6542649">Section 2 which is used by the appellant to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court, I think quite clearly suggests that a statute has to have been put in issue before the State Court, allegedly repugnant to the constitution which statute was decided in favor of the Commonwealth or in favor of the state at the highest Court possible for the defendant -- the appellant to have a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.407" offset="6664902">I regard that is being construed or that which statute being construed literally, I would respectfully suggest to the Court that what is an issue here really is an assertion of a right that is I suppose comprise out of a procedure in Massachusetts that is of all at least arguably over a period of two centuries at least and probably three centuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.289" offset="6776497">To that extent, what he is doing is asserting a right under Section 3, and therefore, if the Court agrees that certiorari is the appropriate way in which this Court has review, I would further suggest to the Court that it has broad jurisdiction or discretionary jurisdiction in whether or not it would in fact grant that particular writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.600" offset="6881719">And having in mind the scope of the relief that the appellant seeks here, it would seem to me appropriate that this Court have before it, a much broader, detailed record dealing with the issues that he claims to deprives him of a constitutional right of jury trial and absent that the Court would deny his application for writ of certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.030" offset="7367387">That is exactly right Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.338" offset="7384628">Proceeding line to analysis of what the Massachusetts Court did in the Ludwig case which is the case before this Court, I think it safe to say or fair to say that the Court simply reaffirmed its judgment in the case of Commonwealth versus Whitmarsh and I think that probably a succinct analysis of that decision would be that Massachusetts said that its de novo trial procedure as outlined here before this Court, at least partially outlined here before this Court, is in fact a constitutionally permissible mode of jury trial in the light of the Duncan and Louisiana case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.352" offset="7544706">I think the Massachusetts Court arguably went one step further and said that it regarded Duncan and Louisiana not as setting forth an absolute right to trial by jury with all of the appendages, if you want to put it that way of the federal system, but as establishing a right rather than a mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.181" offset="7632060">And that in order for us to determine here today whether or not the mode that Massachusetts applies is constitutionally valid, it seems to me that we have to examine to a great extent the mechanics or the definition, if you want, of the Massachusetts de novo procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.954" offset="7711159">Very briefly there are four levels of Courts in Massachusetts which deal with criminal cases. There are other District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.441" offset="7745118">They are 73 in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.332" offset="7756612">They are geographically located throughout the Commonwealth of the Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.004" offset="7775315">They are in their composition I suppose rural, urban, and suburban.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.473" offset="7797154">Some of the have several criminal sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.354" offset="7804677">It includes also -- that 73 includes the Boston Municipal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.839" offset="7826620">Its jurisdiction in criminal cases is covered by Chapter 218, Section 4 the Massachusetts General Laws which covers really all misdemeanors and certain felonies punishable by up to five years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.504" offset="7873327">Although I think it should be noted that District Court Judges had that first tier level if they take jurisdiction in terms of a felony involving possible punishment up to five years imprisonment, the District Court judge cannot sentence to the Massachusetts State Prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.469" offset="7941141">He can only sentence to the House of Correction and obviously there are no juries at that particular level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.181" offset="7967994">The Superior Court is the Court which I suppose is most adequately described as our great trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.868" offset="7994744">It has a original jurisdiction in all criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.214" offset="8008119">It serves as an appeal court for the cases coming out of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.733" offset="8026195">There is somewhat of a interposition, approximately 11 years ago of a six-man jury trial where on appeal from the District Court, what you can in effect do is waive your 12-man jury trial in the Superior Court and opt for a six-man jury trial, so probably the six-man jury is better described as being in for the purposes of our discussion, the appeal level or the Superior Court type of level.</text>

            <text syncTime="2089.469" offset="8461186">I think the next thing that we should consider is that in the context of that particular structure of judicial dealing with criminal cases, what happens at the first tier and I think that Mr. Justice Blackmun raised a very pertinent point when he asked, I think in connection probably having in mind Colten and Kentucky whether or not the defendant in the Massachusetts Trial Court, the first tier court has the ability to evade or to otherwise move away from that particular procedure in some sort of waive the posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.954" offset="8603083">I would suggest to the Court that there is a procedure and it was alluding to somewhat by counsel for the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.388" offset="8640909">There is a procedure known as admitting sufficient findings of fact wherein the District Court and this is not a statutory procedure, but an accepted procedure that has evolved over years in the Court, where the District Court Justice will hear just sufficiently enough evidence I suppose to want him in concluding that there is probable cause for the existence of the complaint because that is how we begin in the first tier system by complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.375" offset="8756788">Once having satisfied himself of that, he then can go ahead and enter a finding of guilty and as a matter of fact impose a sentence on that from which at least in the contention of the Commonwealth that person who has just made that admission has an immediate right to wipe the slate clean once and forever.</text>

            <text syncTime="2707.118" offset="10931743">Your Honor it is moving along in the argument, the Commonwealth's position is that when this Court enunciated Duncan and Louisiana, what it did really was a establish a right to trial by jury, but did not establish a mode to constitutional jury trial, and therefore, it is open to Massachusetts and other de novo states to examine whether or not the de novo procedures that they have in effect deliver constitutionally mandated jury trial in a constitutional mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.367" offset="11084821">And I would respectfully suggest to the Court that on the intense analysis that this Court is made by its procedure and in weighing it against the perspectives that was set out in analyzing the jury trial right in Duncan and Louisiana, we can find that the Massachusetts system is basic and fundamental, first by way of historical analysis, second by way of contemporary practice as among other states and thirdly, to the extent that it fulfills the stated function and purpose of the jury trial in America to wit I suppose to stand as a bastion against depression and to allow a person accused of crime to have the judgment of his peers in any given criminal case that is presented against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.761" offset="11282306">It seems to me that by that analysis and by a fair and objective appraisal of the Massachusetts system, we can find that the Massachusetts system does serve to prevent (1) unfounded criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies, (2) Judges who are too responsive to the voice of higher authority, (3) Protection against arbitrary action, (4) The Massachusetts system does prevent the corrupt an overzealous prosecutor, (5) It does prevent the situation where you have a compliant or a biased or eccentric judge, (6) It does preserve to present the exercise of plainary powers over the life and liberty of the citizens by one judge or a group of judges and (7) It does prevent un-checked power and it does prevent arbitrary law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.206" offset="11488151">It seems to me that going back and analyzing Duncan against Louisiana, this Court try to determine what constitutional jury trial was in terms of its history and in terms of its contemporary use I suppose in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.728" offset="11566205">But it seem to me that thereafter that when this Court decided cases such as Apodaca and such as Williams in Florida or Apodaca in Oregon, that what it did really was lean more toward an evaluation of whether or not this particular jury system that is put in question serves those basic purposes that I just told and if the answer to that is in the affirmative then the system that is challenged in the given state stands the test of constitutionally fair jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2918.597" offset="11777692">Well, again I think that my position in Callan against Wilson, of the Callan and Wilson case is this if your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.661" offset="11813950">Duncan and Louisiana in interpreting Callan and Wilson as I suppose was imposed upon the states, in effect said, that where you would be entitled to a jury trial in a federal system for a particular offense that is beyond petty, you are entitled to a jury trial in the given state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.526" offset="11901408">My understanding of the Duncan and Louisiana case was that there was a statute which provided for no jury trial and yet allowed a punishment up to two years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.846" offset="11946652">The Callan case apparently involved imprisonment potential over six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.853" offset="11970685">Six months or over and the Court I think simply said in Duncan and Louisiana in interpreting Callan and Wilson, that where a state seeks to impose punishment of over six months in as much as you would be entitled to a jury trial in the Federal Court if that were the case, you are entitled to a jury trial in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.286" offset="12056471">So, I guess what I am saying is, I know what I am saying is that if this state now that is in a position where it can sentence somebody to more than six months imprisonment, this Court would say in terms of Duncan and Louisiana and Callan and Wilson that that state has to provide a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.714" offset="12122195">I do not suggest to the Court that in Duncan and Louisiana, this Court have enunciated what mode of jury trial that had to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.673" offset="12149990">As a matter of fact, I think the Court has gone on later on in Apodaca and then Williams to indicate that certain guarantees in terms of Federal Jury Trial certainly are not binding on the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="3135.376" offset="12644853">It seems to me that Colten and Kentucky is dispositive at that contention here by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.788" offset="12670453">I suggest that for several reasons and one is that my recollection of the Colten and Kentucky case directing itself to the question of double jeopardy contrasted Pearson North Carolina case -- quite distinguished the Pearson North Carolina case and pointed to the question of vindictiveness and I think to a certain extent that has just been touched upon here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.461" offset="12773167">It does not appear that, for example, in terms of, I suppose exiting your right to appeal on trial de novo that you are in any jeopardy of vindictiveness because what you are doing is you are going from a different Court system to a Superior Court where the people who will adjudicate your claim are in no way connected with the first Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.134" offset="12879851">Secondly, I think the Court’s position that if in fact in Colten and Kentucky, you have a true de novo type of system where there is in effect a wiping clean of the slate than obviously all of those things that are inherent in double jeopardy such as the hazards of trial, the necessity of utilizing your tools, I suppose at that given hearing, all of those types of things are non-existent in that so called de novo procedure, and therefore, are not vulnerable to a claim of double jeopardy as I see it and I would respectfully suggest to the Court that it would be totally consistent with the finding in Colten and Kentucky to find that Massachusetts de novo system exactly does wipe the slate clean, and therefore, presents no double jeopardy problem to this particular Court.</text>
