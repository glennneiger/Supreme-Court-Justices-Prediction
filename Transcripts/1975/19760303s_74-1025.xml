            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73680">Mr. Justice White has two opinions to announce for the Court, one in 1025, Hines against Anchor Motor Freight and another in 1137, Lavine against Milne.</text>

            <text syncTime="15.525" offset="135747">In the Hines case which is here from the Sixth Circuit on writ of certiorari, the petitioners were discharged and their discharge was upheld by a Joint Arbitration Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.930" offset="197396">They then brought suit claiming breach of contract by the employer and a breach of its duty of fair representation on part of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.697" offset="240446">The District Court gave summary judgment for both, the employer and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.862" offset="269076">Court of Appeals reversed the judgment and sent back for trial the case against the union, but affirmed the judgment in favor of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.642" offset="312230">We, in turn, reverse that judgment in favor of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.039" offset="329784">Under our cases, if the employees -- if the discharged employees, prevail against the union, they will be entitled also to a remedy against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.038" offset="373775">Our reasons are set out at greater length in an opinion which is on file with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.987" offset="397598">Mr. Justice Stewart, while joining the opinion, filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.412" offset="419228">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion and he is joined by the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.602" offset="443992">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
