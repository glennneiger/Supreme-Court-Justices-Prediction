            <text syncTime="15.790" offset="167828">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which in effect orders the setting aside of Respondents, California conviction of second-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.148" offset="229268">The murder took place in San Bernardino, late in the evening of February 17, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.567" offset="258943">Respondent Lloyd Charles Powell with three companions entered a liquor store owned by Gerald and Mary Parsons.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.663" offset="291335">While one of the group was making a small purchase, respondent was observed in the act of shoplifting a half gallon of wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.580" offset="330936">He struck Mr. Parsons in the mouth with his fist, a fighting shoot.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.720" offset="351521">During the struggle, respondent took Mr. Parsons’ revolver from in and fired two shots.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.848" offset="376076">The first struck Mr. Parsons in the arm wounding him.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.611" offset="391123">The second struck Mrs. Parsons just below the neck, punctured her lung and resulted in her death the following morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.189" offset="433441">The Town of Henderson, Nevada is located approximately 180-airline miles Northeast of San Bernardino and 8 miles Southeast of Las Vegas.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.918" offset="476386">Shortly after 10 a.m. on the morning after the shooting, Henderson Police Officer Edward Lauten(ph) while on routine patrol observed two men walking across the parking lot of a shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.706" offset="527482">One of the two was the respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.787" offset="543782">Approximately 10 a.m. in the morning your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.041" offset="556843">As soon as the two saw the police car, they turned about and started rapidly in the direction they had been coming from.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.991" offset="584638">When officer Lauten(ph) made a U-turn and started to approach them, the two split up.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.452" offset="606476">Officer Lauten(ph) honked his horn.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.967" offset="616507">Respondent kept walking rapidly towards the rear of the department store.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.206" offset="633539">Finally, Officer Lauten(ph) got out and ordered respondent to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.905" offset="652243">Officer Lauten(ph) asked respondent for some identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.574" offset="666976">He replied that his identification papers had been stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.462" offset="682545">He did give the officer his name and date of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.171" offset="697382">The officer then radioed for a warrant’s check which came back negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.545" offset="718803">Respondent told the officer he had been staying with friends in Las Vegas for the past few days but he did not give their names and he did not know their address.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.724" offset="755583">He stated that he was on his way to Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.699" offset="767495">The officer also tended to disbelieve this because the most direct route from Las Vegas to Points East does not pass through Henderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.673" offset="803335">A local ordinance makes it a misdemeanor for a person to loiter without apparent reason or business, and to refuse to identify himself and to account for his presence when asked by a peace officer to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.898" offset="856207">When the surrounding circumstances would indicate to a reasonable man that the public safety demand such identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.567" offset="886927">Officer Lauten(ph) arrested respondent for violating that ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.623" offset="903123">A search incident to the arrest turned up the murder weapon.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.077" offset="936977">The respondent’s trial in June 1968 in the San Bernardino County Superior Court, the revolver was admitted into evidence after the trial judge had heard and denied respondent’s motion to suppress it as the product of an illegal search.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.700" offset="1003433">The jury subsequently found respondent guilty of second-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.194" offset="1021405">Respondent appealed his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.597" offset="1031018">One of his contentions was that his arrest and the incidental search were illegal because the Henderson Vagrancy Ordinance was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.094" offset="1065082">In October 1969, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction holding it was not necessary to reach the merits of the search point because admission of the revolver into evidence, even if it were error would not have affected the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.966" offset="1136553">Respondent did not seek a hearing in the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.803" offset="1151913">However, he did subsequently apply to that court for a writ of habeas corpus and his petition was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.120" offset="1181170">In August 1971, state remedies having been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.128" offset="1201127">Respondent filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.451" offset="1234460">That court issued an order to show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.490" offset="1246580">After receiving briefs and examining the record of the state trial, the District Court denied the writ in February 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.640" offset="1283256">Significantly, in its order denying the writ, the District Court declared the purpose of the exclusionary rule would not be advanced by ex post facto condemnation of an arrest which was apparently valid when made.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.565" offset="1350966">And the facts developed at petitioner’s trial show that the arresting officer had probable cause to believe that he had observed the petitioner violate the ordinance.On December 4, 1974, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.490" offset="1422646">Ostensibly, directing further proceedings in conformity with this opinion but actually ordering the writ granted and petitioner released.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.203" offset="1457441">Excuse me your Honor, respondent released.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.996" offset="1468621">Its opinion, a triumph of logic over justice reasoned as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.556" offset="1494848">Under proper crystal, the city of Jacksonville, the Henderson Vagrancy Ordinance is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.934" offset="1520448">Therefore respondent’s arrest was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.632" offset="1531211">Therefore the revolver found in the incidental search was illegally obtained evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.783" offset="1551795">Second, that the arresting officer acted reasonably and in good faith as of no moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.478" offset="1574574">Application of the exclusionary rule in this case is appropriate to preserve judicial integrity and to deter legislative bodies from enacting unconstitutional statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.093" offset="1616997">Admission of the revolver was not harmless error, therefore, respondents; California murder conviction must be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.289" offset="1661823">Thus, the question before this court in this case is—</text>

            <text syncTime="407.382" offset="1734234">I think it is safe to assume that when the officer found the revolver in the incidental search, he forgot all about the Vagrancy Ordinance and continued to process and book respondent for the more serious charge of carrying a concealed weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.805" offset="1803929">But that is simply an assumption I make.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.051" offset="1972889">The question for decision is whether a California murderer is to go free on Federal habeas corpus because he was arrested under a Nevada Ordinance which may have violated a decision of this court handed down two years after the conviction became final, four years after the arrest and more significantly more than four years after the ordinance was adapted.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.706" offset="2075498">The question specified by this court in its order granting review namely whether in light of the fact that Officer Lauten(ph) had probable cause to arrest respondent for violation of an ordinance which at that time had not been authoritatively declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.846" offset="2144043">Respondents claim based on the search incident of that arrest is one cognizable on Federal habeas corpus, invites a preliminary inquiry that is even more fundamental, that is, whether Fourth Amendment claims of state prisoners should be cognizable at all in such proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.521" offset="2218754">We raised this very question in Schneckloth versus Bustamante and Justice Powell treated it in his concurring opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2077.293" offset="8413849">Well, I think in this case the Ninth Circuit was correct when they pointed out in the case that the Attorney General makes no suggestion that there was a right to a Terry type frisk because there was no suspicion at all that this person was armed from whatever source that suspicion might come from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.040" offset="8468811">It just was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.489" offset="8474662">They just saw someone walking in a shopping center and thought that that was a suspicious person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.596" offset="8515100">In any event, the ordinance in this case under which he was arrested itself authorizes unreasonable searches and seizures because the ordinance allows a full custodial arrest for what under Terry at the most would be a brief detention and if there was reasonably, there was a gun, a frisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.259" offset="8593676">In this case, not only can he be arrested but he can also be prosecuted simply for being a suspicious person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.740" offset="8623665">It also was unreasonable arrest under the ordinance because the ordinance was not clear enough to advise either the police officer or someone who is trying to hue his conduct to the standards of the ordinance of what the prescribed conduct is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.016" offset="8712690">There are other violations of this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.529" offset="8726796">The ordinance is also unconstitutional because it violates the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.627" offset="8747172">The ordinance makes it a crime in this case for someone to refuse to a suspect, a criminal suspect to refuse to give a narrative account to an investigating police officer of his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.273" offset="8797745">I think that is a gross violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.643" offset="8811224">The attorney general in this case argues that the police officer acted in good faith when he arrested under this ordinance and I would suggest that if good faith were the standard at the time that this arrest was made, this could not have been made in good faith because if either Officer Lauten(ph) or the Henderson, Nevada City Council had bothered to take a look at the law as it existed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.105" offset="8917072">They would have found cases beginning with Boyd in 1886 and certainly they would have found the Miranda case which requires a police officer to advise someone that he has a right to remain silent and he would have found Davis versus Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.756" offset="8971720">A case in which this court said, that while a police officer may ask questions about unsolved crimes, he has no right to compel answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.047" offset="9012889">Those cases were both on the books at the time that this arrest was made and I fail to see how a police officer who on a daily basis advises people of the Miranda rights could possibly believe in the constitutionality of an ordinance that made it a crime to refuse to answer the police officer’s questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4157.038" offset="16732804">Some random thoughts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.220" offset="16741581">First, there was probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.495" offset="16750672">The district court after an independent examination of the State Trial record found probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.741" offset="16779616">Second, counsel’s argument appears to imbued bad faith to the Town Counsel of Henderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.760" offset="16803753">I would simply point out that the Henderson Vagrancy Ordinance was based on a Nevada statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.095" offset="16833010">The Nevada statute was in turn based upon the California disorderly conduct statute and the California disorderly conduct statute was enacted in 1961 based on a model suggested by a respected scholar, Professor Arthur Sherry of the University of California, Law School who had served as the Head of Governor Earl Warren’s Crime Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.088" offset="16936977">Counsel also cited Almeida-Sanchez, however in Almeida-Sanchez, as this court noted in Peltier, there were no independent considerations of exclusionary rule policy considered by the court apart from the validity of the statute which was challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.846" offset="17044079">I respectfully urge the court again to reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit and to reinstate this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.483" offset="17074590">After all, this is not a vagrancy case this is a murder case.</text>
