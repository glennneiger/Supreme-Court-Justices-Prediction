            <label>Mr. Michael L. Boicourt</label>
            <text syncTime="46.238" offset="288308">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.182" offset="300011">This matter comes on for hearing upon the grant by the Court of the writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit limited to two specific questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.322" offset="348599">The first issue is whether the respondents who are two St. Louis physicians licensed to practice Medicine in Missouri has standing to challenge in Federal Courts, the constitutionally of the Missouri state statute which provides that benefit payment maybe made to eligible needy persons for medical assistance, including medical assistance for family planning services but that such family planning services shall not include abortions unless same are medically indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.763" offset="474404">The second issue over which the Court has accepted the certiorari is whether the Eighth Circuit had jurisdiction to take under consideration and determine the constitutionally of a state statute on appeal from an order of the District Court dismissing a complaint for lack of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.354" offset="560713">A three-judge panel of the United States District Court for Eastern District of Missouri dismissed count two, which we are now concerned with the other two counts not having been appealed to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.612" offset="605748">Respondents complaint on the basis that although the issue itself may have been judicable, the two physicians who brought the law suit were not the proper parties to allege in Federal Courts that this particular statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.903" offset="670950">This order granting the petitioner's motion to dismiss was appealed to United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.454" offset="709088">The Eighth Circuit Court found, first that the District Court was incorrect in its decision on standing and reversed the action of the District Court in finding that these two physicians do not have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.836" offset="770633">But the Court below did not stop at that point, the Court went on to the determine that it had jurisdiction to reach the merits of the respondent's constitutional claims on the basis of the state statute challenge was so obviously constitutional is not to require remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.861" offset="842731">After the Court then took up the constitutional merits of the original complaint, the lower Court ruled that this particular statute was especially unconstitutional to the violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.090" offset="919635">Count two with which we are concerned which, the plaintiff's complaint which was filed in the Eastern District Court of Missouri included all necessary allegations in order to invoke a three-Judge District Court statute passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.305" offset="992569">The allegation was that the language in Missouri statute, that medical benefit payments will not be made else, only the needy persons for family planning services for abortions unless such abortions are medically indicated was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.045" offset="1079505">Respondents purported to bring their action on their own behalf and on the behalf of the entire class of duly licensed physicians in Missouri, presently performing or desiring to perform abortions upon women, minors and adults were eligible for Missouri state Medicaid assistants.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.484" offset="1181278">In response to the complaint, the petitioner filed a motion to dismiss which among other things raised the point that the respondent physicians did not have sufficient standing to adjudicate the constitutionally of this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.510" offset="1245330">The only factual matters which went on the record before the District Court ruled on that motion to dismiss was a limited number of answers to interrogatories by the petitioner in which he noted that he knew no official interpretation to the challenged language and that no medically indicated abortion payments had been made over a period of three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.667" offset="1333937">An affidavits of the doctors attached to their suggestions and our position to our motion to dismiss, to the effect that they were unsure as to what the statutory language met, how it would be interpreted, that this uncertainty as to its interpretation chilled their ability to practice medicine as the they deemed most expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.763" offset="1418365">This was the entire record on which the Court of Appeals based its decision to dismiss on the basis of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.149" offset="1447936">And that was the entire record that went to Eighth Circuit when the respondent doctors in this case chose to appeal that order.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="343.551" offset="1477506">Mr. Boicourt does the record show whether or not the payments in question would have gone to the patient and then to the doctor or would have gone directly to the doctor?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_l_boicourt" startTime="358.511" stopTime="445.557">
            <label>Mr. Michael L. Boicourt</label>
            <text syncTime="358.511" offset="1537379">As I understand the system, Mr. Justice Rehnquist the patient makes application for the Medicaid benefit payments, since that in to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.055" offset="1575518">The state then on behalf of the patient sends the money itself directly to the treating physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.628" offset="1613865">At the time that the Eighth Circuit took up this matter on appeal, petitioner had never filed an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.789" offset="1646466">No meaningful discovery had been conducted by their party.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.193" offset="1668096">The record before the Eighth Circuit pertaining to the constitutionality of this statute consisted solely of conclusary allegations included in the original complaint in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.954" offset="1719087">The District Court had not conducted a hearing into the constitutionally of the statute and had made absolutely no pronouncement as to its beliefs concerning the statute's constitutional merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.479" offset="1777183">In addition, the petitioners never had the opportunity to present evidence to brief or to argue the constitutional claims included in original complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.948" offset="1827129">Nevertheless, the Court below not only reversed on the issue of standing, they went on to find that it had jurisdiction to hold that the statute was facially unconstitutional.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="445.557" stopTime="450.640">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="445.557" offset="1885539">(Inaudible) the oral argument to these issues?</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_l_boicourt" startTime="450.640" stopTime="486.937">
            <label>Mr. Michael L. Boicourt</label>
            <text syncTime="450.640" offset="1905914">In the Eighth Circuit, your Honor, the petitioner did not brief or discuss the merits below, believing that it was appealed solely from an order dismissing for lack of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.587" offset="1953666">The respondents did brief rather extensively whether or not the statute was constitutional or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.671" offset="1985954">Again, it will be our point that their brief and argument concerning that matter was not responsive to the purposes of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.156" offset="2015942">That is an appeal from a final order dismissing for lack of standing not on the basis of the statute when unconstitutional.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="486.937" stopTime="496.975">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="486.937" offset="2051051">Or are you under some notice though I take it that, since they were the appellant, that they were at least urging the unconstitutionality of the statute before the Eighth Circuit?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_l_boicourt" startTime="496.975" stopTime="628.894">
            <label>Mr. Michael L. Boicourt</label>
            <text syncTime="496.975" offset="2091175">We certainly got their brief first and they did brief the constitutionality of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.740" offset="2114267">However as I said, we did not feel that was responsive to the notice of appeal itself or to what the District Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.556" offset="2145510">If the Court should agree on appeal with the District Court that these physicians do not have sufficient standing to adjudicate this matter, it will not be necessary in my opinion for the Court to reach the second issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.571" offset="2201621">The respondents in effect will be out of the court in any consideration as to merits will be then be moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.935" offset="2231087">In regard to standing the question before the Court is not in an abstract sense, whether section 208.152 (12) the revised statute to Missouri is or is not unconstitutional or whether the issue of this constitutionally is judicable question again in an abstract sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.455" offset="2317082">Rather it is necessary that the respondent physicians allege and have support in the record before the Court that they are proper parties to litigate in the Federal Courts, this constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.146" offset="2383851">The only personal interest which I believe the respondents can claim is the existence of some degree of confusion as to the source of payments for abortions performed on the specific class of present and perspective patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.313" offset="2456576">And if the respondents even with the best of intentions are expressing only their moral indignation at the statute or if they are trying to represent the interest of pregnant welfare women who they feel are being discriminated against by the statute, even at their perspective patients, that is not enough for them to have standing to use the Federal tribunals and to take up the dockets of the Federal Court to adjudicate this issue about which they have no personal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.695" offset="2594084">I do not believe that the Federal Court should become a form for morally righteous crusade.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="628.894" stopTime="640.126">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="628.894" offset="2618848">Do the doctors not make any claim that they would have gotten money through this plan, if the section which they claim was unconstitutional, were stricken and that they did not get the money without it?</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_l_boicourt" startTime="640.126" stopTime="662.780">
            <label>Mr. Michael L. Boicourt</label>
            <text syncTime="640.126" offset="2663779">The actual claim in their complaint, your honor, was that they did not know what the interpretation of the section was and therefore they were deterred in the practice of Medicine not knowing whether they may or they may not paid by state of Missouri for abortions performed on eligible welfare recipients.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="662.780" stopTime="665.172">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="662.780" offset="2754476">(Inaudible) they were to be paid, they would have done --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_l_boicourt" startTime="665.172" stopTime="921.029">
            <label>Mr. Michael L. Boicourt</label>
            <text syncTime="665.172" offset="2763985">Certainly, the inference is made in their complaint that they would be ultimate source of welfare moneys paid out by the state of Missouri but for the existence of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.991" offset="2835247">However, in regard to whether or not they might be the ultimate recipient of Medicaid moneys paid by the state of Missouri I still think that the traditional standing requirements arising out of Article 3 of Federal Constitution requires that they be able to show a personal and direct detriment which arises out of alleged unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.152" offset="2935870">Now, any monetary detriment to the respondent physicians in this case is indirect.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.930" offset="2959067">It does not arise out of any alleged unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.327" offset="2972651">It arises out of the perspective decisions by patients and perspective patients regarding abortions, whose decision on behalf of the patients, may or may not be affected by the existence of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.159" offset="3035972">In other words if this statute is to be attacked on the grounds of its unconstitutionality and if the Federal Courts ought to accept that attack as a judicable question and consider it, the proper parties to adjudicate the matter are not the respondent physicians but rather they are the pregnant women who are most directly affected by the conjecture operation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.357" offset="3148716">I think it is obvious from a reading of the multitude of cases cited on both briefs that pregnant woman have certainly been able to participate in the Federal Court process involving abortion litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.741" offset="3206290">I think it is even more apparent that they are protected in this participation by the use of such names as Roe and Doe which would protect them from any embarrassment arising out of their supporting their constitutional right to an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.649" offset="3277865">I think that given the protection of this Court has found that it can give to the unanimity for women desiring to participate an abortion litigation certainly unnecessary for the Federal Court to entertain litigation which is brought by persons not within the direct personal causation line of the statute and constitutional provisions concerned in what they desire that had to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.145" offset="3403880">In Roe and Doe the Court determined that the constitutional right to privacy was broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy, unless the woman’s right to privacy that is protected by constitution, but certainly she could consult with the physician to assist her in exercising her decision making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.309" offset="3508579">But is still her right which is protected by the constitutional her privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.548" offset="3533552">To be sure in Doe versus Bolton, physicians were found to have standing to participate in the litigation but not on the basis of constitutional right to privacy rather on the basis that they were to suffer direct personal detriment from the existence of statutes under which they could be criminally prosecuted in the state Courts of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.401" offset="3628951">The challenged Missouri statute does not subject the physician respondents to any criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.216" offset="3668135">The status of respondents is more closely akin I believe to the childless married couple in Roe versus Wade who asserted that if the wife became pregnant in the future, they would desire an abortion—like that childless married couple, the respondent may choose to perform abortions on legit women.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.308" offset="3752563">And those women, if eligible, may choose to apply for Medical assistance as a means for providing the respondents a pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="954.861" offset="3922777">Secondly we do not think that the state of Missouri or officials of the state of Missouri should be subjected in the Federal Courts to crusading type law suits like this one is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.677" offset="5965970">Well, I respectfully submit that only final decision before the Eighth Circuit was one dismissing a complaint for lack of standing because the District Court certainly never considered anything other that the standing of decisions with respect to what they did to count two of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.113" offset="6051756">When the Eighth Circuit determined that it could reach the merits and proceeded to do so, I believe that it began to exercise original jurisdiction which it had not been deferred upon it by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.719" offset="6138169">Furthermore, the complaint which raised the constitutional issues made every allegation necessary for a three-judge District Court to be impaneled and in fact the complaint specifically requested that the three-judge District Court be impaneled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.586" offset="6205670">Congress has mandated that with regard to such complaints, that in the first instance they be considered by a three-judge District Court with direct appeal to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.077" offset="6251645">As matter, now stands in the first instance, the constitutionality of this statute has been considered only by the Eighth Circuit and certainly I can see nowhere in Congressional scheme of Federal Court jurisdiction where Eighth Circuit has jurisdiction to step in into the matter on an issue like standing on appeal the reach a decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.375" offset="6372853">The Sixth Circuit was called upon to do the same thing as the Eighth Circuit has done in this case in Roe versus Ferguson, a statute which is extremely similar to statute we are concerned here and again the three-judge District Court had not reached the question of the statute’s constitutionality.</text>
