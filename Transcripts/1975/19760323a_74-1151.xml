            <text syncTime="16.801" offset="170572">Mr. Susman you may precede whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank Susman</label>
            <text syncTime="20.208" offset="184156">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.361" offset="196799">Just a little over three years ago, this Court spoke firmly and clearly, not as an advocate of abortion, but as an advocate of each individual woman’s right under her then existing particular circumstances, and in consultation with her physician to terminate her pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.584" offset="273703">Subject to certain and delineating, compelling state interest, a right to abortion was then recognized as equal to the right to bear children.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.800" offset="314559">In the intervening three years, many things have remained static and many other things have changed. Unchanged in particular are certain fundamental observations that were made by this Court in its decision in Roe versus Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.694" offset="374118">This includes one; the fact of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy and the deep and seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires, noted by the Court at page 116.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.486" offset="429289">Secondly, was the support of the Court’s position by broadly based and concerned organizations, which included and still include today things such as the American Medical Association, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist, the American Public Health Association and the American Bar Association, also noted in the Court’s opinion, at pages 144 to 146.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.246" offset="524270">And thirdly, was the relative safety of abortion, when compared to the mortality risk normally associated with child birth, noted by the Court at page 149.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.636" offset="565857">And lastly, was the observation that those trained in the respective disciplines of Medicine, Philosophy and Theology, are unable to arrive at any consensus of a question of when life begins, noted by the Court at page 159.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.663" offset="630014">But I would suggest that even more dramatic are those changes which have been directly wrought by those -- the court’s decision of that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.628" offset="661883">The first is that Septic Abortions in the United States have decreased by 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.048" offset="683512">Secondly, Maternal Mortality associated with pregnancy has decreased by 80% in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.474" offset="713187">And Thirdly, Illegitimate Births have also dramatically decreased.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.187" offset="736071">It is somehow cruelly ironic that that area of medical practice, afforded the greatest constitutional protection by this Court, is the same area of medical practice over which the State of Missouri has seen fit to exercise the greatest legislative control.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.024" offset="807437">In 1971, just five years ago, approximately 38% of the world’s population had access to safe medical and legal abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.673" offset="845994">Only five years later now in 1976, two-thirds of the world’s population enjoys that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.314" offset="876609">No democracy has ever reversed the trend of liberalizing abortion once accomplished and yet the District Court’s opinion below has severely throttled and restricted this Court’s opinions of Roe versus Wade and Doe versus Bolton and has hampered the medical progress and the reproductive freedom for women, granted by this court in 1973, in which was over a hundred years in coming to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.518" offset="977442">In addition, there is a side effect of restrictive abortions and particularly those in the second trimester and that is that it threatens to cripple all of the advances made in amniocentesis, by which today approximately 60 serious genetic chromosomal disorders can now be diagnosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.284" offset="1048495">We would also point out that the District Court’s opinion below, is the only Federal Court challenged to uphold major legislation or policy in the area of abortion since January 22nd of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.415" offset="1096978">In all other cases in which policy or legislation was challenged, it was voided as not meeting the requirements of Roe and Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.250" offset="1128325">The jurisdiction of this Court is clear under the holdings in Gonzales and M.T.M. This Court in Roe and Doe, and subsequent courts, which have had little difficulty in understanding the opinions rendered by this Court, have set up certain standards and tests by which abortion legislation and abortion policy is to be judged and they include among others; number one, the delineation of the period of gestation in the various periods, frequently called trimesters, but not truly so, at the first trimester and then the second period running up to the point of viability and the period afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.450" offset="1273148">They have consistently held that regulations not observing these distinctions as set forward in the Court’s opinions are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.606" offset="1301778">Secondly is the test of equating abortion with other procedures, a test first enunciated by the Eight Circuit in a case entitled Doe versus Pelker (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="309.606" offset="1341798">In that case the Eight Circuit pointed out that anytime the states seeks to single out abortion from among the hundreds and thousands of other medical and surgical procedures for special attention, it has imposed an extra layer of regulation and an extra burden and thus is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.652" offset="1405955">Thirdly are the tests referred to the by the Court itself, those of compelling state interest, placing a stronger burden upon the state who attempts to pass such regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.267" offset="1448378">Along with the compelling state interest test of course, is the fact that any regulations enacted, which conform to those test must be narrowly drawn and we suggest as we will go through each of these sections that are challenged here this morning, that they are not so narrowly drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.060" offset="1507623">Again, is a test which is required that abortion be treated equally with childbirth and that it not be legislatively disfavored by the legislation which is enacted, particularly in light of the fact that abortion for periods well into the second trimester are still safer in the mortality rates for childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.068" offset="1587558">And lastly as the observation, the effect of any restrictions upon access to abortion are more onerous for the poor and for the young.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.295" offset="1624547">It is basically of course very difficult to go into any great detail in any of this sections due to the time that it is allotted, and therefore, we will attempt to only take them in order as they appear in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.871" offset="1670836">First Section that was challenged is Section 2(2), which involves the definition of viability.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.240" offset="1696332">The statute provides that viability is defined as follows, “that stage of fetal development, when the life of the unborn child maybe continued indefinitely outside of the womb by natural or artificial life support of systems.”</text>
            <text syncTime="412.760" offset="1754324">This section needs to be read of course in conjunction with Section 5, providing the no-abortion not necessary for life or health maybe performed after the period of viability as statutorily defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.816" offset="1802598">This Court in speaking of viability, spoke about it in several different ways and on three separated occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.671" offset="1829974">First on page 160 of the decision in Roe, it referred the viability as usually being placed about seven months, twenty-eight weeks, but may occur earlier even at twenty-four weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.807" offset="1878562">Secondly, on page 163, the Court said that point of time in which the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother’s womb and in the third place also on page 160, the Court referred to when the fetus is potentially able to live outside the mother’s womb or be it with artificial aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.484" offset="1969259">We do not believe as the State contends that the Court may only look to one of these meanings, and thereby incorporate it statutorily into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.842" offset="2006667">We believe that all three must be look like -- look at and taken as a group.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.462" offset="2029132">First of all this restriction in definition invades the first trimester.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.416" offset="2048985">By the mere addition of the word indefinitely which do not appear in the Supreme Court’s decision, which dictionary is defined as indeterminate, it provides for remote possibility even for seconds of survival, and yet the idea of brief respiratory gasp or fleeting heartbeats are not considered by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as life.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.031" offset="2139473">Fleeting heartbeats and respiratory gasps are still considered to qualify as a stillbirth under those definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.032" offset="2171447">Three courts, three Federal Courts have held that in fact this Court’s language as to twenty-eight weeks, but perhaps occurring at twenty-four was not dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.612" offset="2209795">That in fact it was to be a lower limit beyond which states could not allow viability to occur under then existing medical evidence before this Court in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.260" offset="2256397">The problem of defining viability involves whether you are talking about a remote possibility of survival as opposed to perhaps a probability.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.855" offset="2290774">This was a problem in the now celebrated trial of Dr. Ethan (ph) in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.248" offset="2308329">We would suggest that the standard be as follows; that there be a irrebuttable and conclusive presumption that viability does not occur before twenty-four weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.180" offset="2348035">And we agree with the three federal courts that have interpreted the Court's decision as saying that this was not intended to be dicta, but was to be a holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.741" offset="2378337">And we further believe that in those cases, the fetus being beyond twenty-four weeks in gestation, that the State has a burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that that particular fetus in question would have survived and not the possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.565" offset="2441553">The fact that one in a thousand at that particular stage of gestation might survive is no answer to the Doctor whose faced of making the decision at the time, as to whether the particular fetus is viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.768" offset="2494425">We also feel that it is necessary to have some form of absolute lower limit, because in practice it has been shown that the physician of course would tend to err on the side of safety for himself and the legal processes and not necessarily with only the woman’s interest in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.961" offset="2575196">Second Section challenged is that Section 3(2) requiring patient's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.058" offset="2603617">This makes it a crime to perform an abortion without requiring the woman to certify in writing that her consent is informed and freely given and not the result of coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.961" offset="2643218">It applies to all stages of pregnancy, and it singles out abortion from all other medical and surgical procedures and makes the physician obtain a specific form of consent at the peril of being convicted of a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.784" offset="4826428">First of all of course, the reason that the husband’s interest is in the marital relationship and not in the fetus is, that the statute does not require the husband be the father of the fetus.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.789" offset="6574438">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.925" offset="6591052">The one overriding issue in this case is whether state legislatures still retain the power to regulate in major areas, traditionally within their power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.331" offset="6652701">In resolving this issue, the Court is faced with several very important sub questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.263" offset="6684361">First, does the state legislature still have the power to define the terms and obligations of marriage?</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.766" offset="6722396">Second, does the legislature still have the power to protect minors from their own immaturity, where stressful and tenuous decisions must be made?</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.354" offset="6772760">Third, does the legislature still have the power to enact reasonable regulations of a trade or profession for the sake of public health, safety and welfare?</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.785" offset="6830438">It is the position of the State of Missouri that the answer to each of these questions is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.905" offset="6858964">First with respect to spousal consent; the legislature of our State has in effect said through the statute that inherent in marriage is that certain decisions are made jointly by husband and wife or they are not made at all, that this is the very definition of what marriage is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.879" offset="6954885">The legislature has done this elsewhere, not only in the State of Missouri, but in other States as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.335" offset="6984665">For example; if a woman has given birth to a child and then decides that she wants to place the child for adoption, if the woman is not married, she alone can make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.705" offset="7046105">If the woman is married, her husband must join in that decision to place the child for adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.686" offset="7078079">The right to consent is not in the punitive father in the State of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.157" offset="7107963">The right to consent to an adoption is in the husband, because this is fundamental decision relating to what the family is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.202" offset="7156133">With respect to artificial inseminations, those States which have legislated on this subject and Missouri is not one of them, have provided specifically that in the case of a married woman, the legitimization of the child depends upon the consent of the husband, if the woman is married.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.005" offset="7255398">In the case of sterilization, two or three states that have legislated in this area have provided expressly that if the woman is married, her husband must join in approval of sterilization, Missouri is not one of those States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.362" offset="7312763">Obviously, legislatures have provided all over the country that where real property is conveyed during a marriage, the husband or wife must join and consent to that conveyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.238" offset="7376293">The fact that the matter is that it has historically been the job and the province of state legislatures to provide by legislation that certain fundamental decisions for the marital entity have to be made by both parties, especially where change is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.190" offset="7460094">And this definition of marriage, this power of legislatures rather than the courts, to define what marriage is all about has been recognized by this Court for at least the last one hundred years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.499" offset="7525295">Expressly in the case of Reynolds versus United States, which incidentally involve a fundamental constitutional right, namely religion, where the Court held that a statute prohibiting polygamy was not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.953" offset="7611186">Likewise in the case of Maynard versus Hill, decided by this Court in 1888, the Court expressly said in that case that it is the job of the legislature and the courts to define the meaning of marriage and terms and the obligations of marriage and what marriage is and we believe that this power which has always been in the legislature should be in the legislature now as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.079" offset="7951614">Furthermore you have a case where the woman is pregnant and is married where something has happened in the marriage itself and that condition is either going to yield to an addition to the family which is proximate and immediate, or it is going to be aborted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.474" offset="8037191">And it is our position that it is for the state legislature to say that that decision can be and must be jointly made and that there is no constitutional provision which provides that the woman and the woman alone without the consent of the husband can make that kind of decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.921" offset="8515023">Well, I think that this type of statute involving an abortion is a change in a family situation which is already been commenced, that is the future baby is on the way, in this case and I think that the legislature could reasonably say that unlike a hysterectomy, which may or may not be called for for any number of medical reasons and abortion which is essentially an elective procedure by the woman which terminates the pregnancy is one that the husband has a particular interest in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.686" offset="8686072">I would point out also that the legislature obviously does regulate the institution of marriage in a number of different ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.975" offset="9159202">However, I think the whole point in what the Court stressed in Roe versus Wade is that abortion, unlike most medical procedures, is generally elective.</text>

            <text syncTime="2286.554" offset="9249586">In Roe versus Wade, and I think this is a very important point, the Court indicated that the decision to have an abortion was a decision that that the woman should make in consultation with her responsible physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.358" offset="9300786">But the facts in this case are that there is no consultation with the physician whatever, that the physician makes no decision whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.501" offset="9341328">That in fact what happens is that the physician is one of a number of doctors on a roster, who shows up for say one morning a week and performs in a period; and this is the case and evidence in the trial, Reproductive Health Services, which is the abortion clinic in the City of Saint Louis, the physician shows up and in a period of three-and-a-half hours performs eight abortions on total strangers and there is absolutely no counseling or medical input from the physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.095" offset="9467761">There is a degree of counseling from people who appear to have no special expertise in counseling, no knowledge of what they are doing, and I would say a strong presumption in their case that they have some extra grind in seeing that abortions are conducted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.154" offset="12691898">No, that is right, that is correct, but there is certainly was every opportunity to, and this was a two-year process of passing this law and went through two legislative sessions and the question of saline was debated both in hearings and on floor of both houses of the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.159" offset="12763996">So, it was not a kind of a secret move to push across prostaglandin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.166" offset="12811956">I do not believe, and it is the position of our state that Roe versus Wade and Doe versus Bolton, so exulted the constitutional right to an abortion, that all of these traditional areas of state legislative action have somehow been suddenly wiped-out as a result of Roe and Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.477" offset="12941210">And I find it difficult to imagine how the rights to an abortion can be used to wipe-out the state traditional authority to regulate in the case of marriage, in the case of protecting minors and in the case of the operation of a trade or profession, without having a serious of Pandora’s Boxes open with the respect to State powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.924" offset="13063045">Now, we think for example that if the State cannot define the terms of marriage in this circumstance, it would equally fall that the State statute requiring special consent for adoption, placing a child for adoption would fall, and that any state restraint on using your body as you like in adultery or bigamy that those prohibitions would fall as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.052" offset="13167535">If a minor cannot be protected from her own improvidence and immaturity, were this kind of stressful and tenuous decision is called for, I do not see how any state statute treating minors different -- differently from adults could pass constitutional muster and if the State cannot regulate the practice of medicine, I think that we are right back in the box of Wagner versus New York and the cases which followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.867" offset="13402846">While realizing that marriage, voting, are also fundamental rights upon which the State has imposed certain age limits, I cannot put those personally in the same class as an abortion, because those rights to marriage and those rights to vote are only postponed for a limited and a small number of years, they are rights that are postponed and the damage for postponing, excuse me?</text>

            <text syncTime="3525.064" offset="14203552">In addition all of the evidence also without exception showed that saline is still safer than sal -- I am sorry, that saline -- saline mortality rates are less than those of natural childbirth.</text>
