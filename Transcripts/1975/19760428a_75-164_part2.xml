            <text syncTime="37.253" offset="252382">If you are not, just some time during your argument, would you address yourself to the question of whether the no majority of any minority provision of the 1970 decree entered by the District Court in this case contemplated annual changes in pupil assignment, solely by reason of demographic changes and if it did, is it consistent with Swann?</text>

            <text syncTime="176.568" offset="809627">Let me make this point Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.648" offset="817881">These petitioners were in violation of that decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.721" offset="830211">Phil Neal said yesterday that nobody supposed that this decree required annual redistricting.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.159" offset="855916">The United States did not suppose that, but it is clear that besides the judge, the one other party to this case that understood that was this School Board because if you look at their notice of motion to modify the decree on page 233 of the appendix, they come in and seek modification on the grounds that they are having trouble complying by annual redistricting. That is under (1) and if you look at the affidavit on 234, a Raymond Cortines who was a superintendent of the schools at 235 and 236, he says, demographic changes are making it difficult for them to keep up, to keep complying.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.945" offset="1019129">If you look at that affidavit of Henry Marquezque (ph) on 237 who was then the President of the Pasadena City Board of Education, he says that, it has become practical impossibility to continue to comply with the portion that judgment of this Court which required that there be no School District having majority of any minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.863" offset="1090809">The School Board understood that they were under an annual obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.016" offset="1107422">That obligation I believe to be invalid, but they had not been changed and they were violating it.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.548" offset="1417548">And furthermore, the other thing about this case is that the kinds of de jure violation shown in 1970 by the kinds that have lingering effect: school citing school capacity decisions, the racial identifiability of schools, they did not even address those problems in their motion for modification and I think the Court of Appeals would be quite right in saying, we want to see those things addressed before we say drop the order altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.724" offset="1530188">I think now that they -- we are told here that they have complied since 1974 and they have done it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.187" offset="1556102">That is all the Court of Appeals requires them.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.942" offset="1563102">I think if they go back at this time, they probably be entitled to removal of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.961" offset="1583164">But in 1974, the Court of Appeals was not required as a matter of law to tell them that the District Court Order has to be lifted in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.180" offset="1620049">That is our entire position, a very narrow position.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.864" offset="1634782">Now, a good deal of what is happening here I think is really an objection to a heavy busing order and that is not really the issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.125" offset="1679818">The United States thinks it is an inappropriate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.121" offset="1691834">The proper scope of initial remedies in cases such as this ought to be reexamined.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.112" offset="1711791">It is our position of proper function of a remedy in this area is like it is in any other area.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.876" offset="1730809">It is an attempt to put matters where they would have been if the violation had never occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.131" offset="1751811">Now, if that is true, if we rethink the problem and it comes out that way, then it is properly true that large scale busing orders indefinitely continued designed to produce a racial mix such as this one are probably beyond the proper scope with equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.195" offset="1816072">But I do not think this is the case to re-examine, although that is part of underlying pressure in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.665" offset="1922025">I am suggesting that the scope of an order, the size of Swann scope perhaps ought to be rethought on the theory that it did much more than put matters where they would have been had there been no de jure violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.670" offset="1982002">I am just saying that was not litigated in the Distinct Court or the Court of Appeals and that I think we should remove that element of this case from our minds for that reason, This is not the appropriate case to address that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.641" offset="2041875">Now, as I say, we have been arguing about what the District Court said, if what the District Court said was still in this case, we would concede that petitioners have a lot of room for well-founded complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="809.928" offset="3343086">I regret that I had to take issue with my colleague respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.606" offset="3361790">The plaintiff’s respondent do not view the 1970 decree as being void, the portion of the decree that says the School Board at that time and until further relieve shall have no majority of a minority in any school of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.749" offset="3438276">I read Swann quite differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.670" offset="3446009">I read Swann to allow just that and that until the School Board has shown that it is a unitary school, a unitary district, it cannot be allowed to be relieved from that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.114" offset="3495746">Now, just one assign, the judgment of the Court did not require that there be any particular racial in any particular school.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.853" offset="3542766">It even allowed Your Honor that there will be all white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.339" offset="3560634">It was the School Board which decided that they would not have any all white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.487" offset="3585293">With Mr. Neal eliminating from the case, any question I thought, I thought he did as to the validity of the 1970 decree, with him eliminating from the case, the question of any possible busing problem in the case, I view the case when I left here last night as involving only one question and that is as to whether the trial court abused its discretion in not relieving the School Board completely from judicial control and alternatively for not allowing it to go forward with this alternative plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.472" offset="3733251">I think that that is what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.034" offset="3747462">And the District Court not only did not abused its discretion in not relieving the board from judicial control, but with due respect have it relieved the board from judicial control, that would have been an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.779" offset="3802423">Let me in a few minutes if I may point out to the Court some of the things that were before the trial court at the time it was asked to relieve the board of a judicial control.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.911" offset="3846936">Incidentally, I also, before I do that, I want to make clear that the board did not ever, ever ask the Court to relieve it of the no majority of the no minority requirement, ever did they do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.809" offset="3902524">They came into court and they asked to be relieved entirely of judicial control or if not then to be allowed to put in that alternative plan and neither one would be proper as I view the case as this Court has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.674" offset="3954038">Let me review for a moment what the Court had to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.379" offset="3968876">Also, although nominally, the School Board is here as a petitioner, this really is a case involving human beings who are charged with the duty of running that school system and its human beings that that judge had to look at and decide whether he would permit them to go free at that time in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.156" offset="4059991">Before the Court at that time were these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.301" offset="4072529">The ink was not even dry on the 1970 judgment of the Court when certain persons, including the architect of the so-called alternative plan started a movement to recall the three members of the board who had the temerity of not appealing the Court’s judgment and who decided to go forward with their efforts to desegregate the School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.327" offset="4168660">These are three members who had just been found guilty of segregating the School system and their slogan in that recall campaign was return to neighborhood schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.988" offset="4643253">Yes, yes, there is indeed, the Northwest portion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.852" offset="4662688">Let me go on if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.783" offset="4678466">The next year, there was an effort talking about white flight which the petitioners have talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.577" offset="4697587">There was an effort for a whole segment of the Pasadena School System to flee from the School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.610" offset="4725800">They asked to be relieved to join another school district adjacent to it which was all white and while the petitioners talk about being concerned with white flight, the architect of the alternative plan voted to allow them to get out to further white flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.468" offset="4785150">That was before the board below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.076" offset="4795599">Another plan was presented by the architect the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.935" offset="4807093">This time he omitted the ghetto black school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.424" offset="4825065">After the three -- and then that same year, the three new members subsequently were elected and became the majority of the Board ran on the same platform that had been the re-callers platform, this time return the neighborhood schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.062" offset="4899566">I will live out the majority of stuff for busing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.508" offset="4917329">During that campaign, one of the members who was running for election, publicly announced that two of his two school children have been taken out of the Pasadena School District out of the public school because of the school to which they have been assigned, thus demonstrating his feeling about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.947" offset="4987129">And I agree with the Court for the First Circuit in the Morgan versus Corrigan (ph) case in which the Court said white flight is an expression of opposition by individuals in the community to desegregation of the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.292" offset="5044493">That was before the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.780" offset="5070407">Virtually the very first act that was done by this new School Board when they took control was to violate the Pasadena Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.746" offset="5102276">This Court has said that the assignment of administrators and faculty is one of the most important part of whether or not a school system is segregated or desegregated and what do these School Board members do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.384" offset="5148879">They immediately in violation of the Pasadena Plan which was very carefully designed by the former School Board members to make sure that there would not be discrimination in administrative appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.005" offset="5191302">They appointed five top administrators in complete violation of the plan which is not the main thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.417" offset="5220977">They appointed them without even trying to get the minority candidates that the Pasadena Plan and what this Court’s decision envisage I think and predictably those five top appointees were Caucasians not minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.809" offset="5290567">Further conduct of these Board Members whereas formally there had been a Black Task Force and a Mexican-American Task Force designed to try to look into the needs of the black and Mexican-American community, as soon as this new School Board took control there was no longer any Black or Mexican-American Task Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.016" offset="5383354">In their conduct among themselves, the School Board members allotted spheres of influence to the four white members of the School Board, none to the black member of the School Board, none and all the time, they were in violation of the no majority of the no minority clause and finally they presented to the Court, the alternative plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.964" offset="5467155">Now, I submit Your Honors that when the trial court was faced with that kind of recalcitrance, it had no alternative, but first to deny the thought of allowing these School Board members to go free and go their own way and go back to segregated schools, go back to black schools and white schools and also to deny the alternative plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.654" offset="5573943">Let me for a moment if I may if I have time, go over a few of the things that Mr. Neal said yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.677" offset="5602051">I have also mentioned, I think that in our judgment, the board had not been in compliance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.340" offset="5632667">Mr. Neal suggested that the judgment of the Court simply had to do with school assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.617" offset="5653773">It did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.569" offset="5657640">It had to do with desegregating the public school system in Pasadena which had been segregated system for years and it ordered desegregation of all features of the Pasadena System, including the administrators and the faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.282" offset="5712497">Mr. Neal suggests there was no resistance to the Pasadena Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.903" offset="5726916">I do not know what resistance is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.837" offset="5734649">You do not have to break windows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.318" offset="5744575">You do not have to turn over buses to show resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.921" offset="5755024">There was resistance with the vengeance and perhaps that is the tragedy of Pasadena.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.760" offset="5774355">Have they not done that, we would not be here at all and they would very well, perhaps be entitled to be relieved of Court supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.164" offset="5815942">By no means have they met the standard of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.521" offset="5829421">They have not been in compliance, not even once.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.347" offset="5840706">That the School Board still needs supervision of the Court to make sure that they do not run amok.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.630" offset="6125858">Mr. Neal suggested that the contempt citation which is still pending on appeal was solely because the School Board did not vacate the appointments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.681" offset="6158041">That is not it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.812" offset="6166609">The decision of the Court is at 384 F. Supp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.402" offset="6176954">We mentioned it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.892" offset="6182910">They were found in contempt because they violated their own Pasadena Plan by appointing five Caucasian administrators without trying to find any minority administrators and they were plenty of qualified ones as the Court’s 1970 opinion shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.867" offset="6238812">Mr. Neal suggested that there was no substantial reason offered for not allowing the relief, the alternative plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.903" offset="6262949">They had the burden of showing that the alternative plan was better than the Pasadena Plan and there is not a shred of proof in it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.345" offset="6288758">Indeed, the record is very clear and the trial court just could not have decided in any other way that had the alternative plan going into effect, say next September, those schools would immediately be black and white schools, quite in violation of this Court’s Green decision that says it should only be schools and not black schools and not white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.781" offset="6386456">Going outside the record, I know we are in the Supreme Court and that perhaps permissible sometimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.968" offset="6407249">Mr. Neal talked about the Audubon school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.976" offset="6419266">One of the difficulties in going and outside the record as you are not able to give the complete picture, Mr. Neal did not mention that the trial court denied the motion of the moving parties at the McKinley School, another school will not be allowed to be established as a Fundamental School.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.432" offset="6489065">He allowed that school to be established as a Fundamental School because it did not interfere with the segregation or desegregation of the Pasadena Schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.430" offset="6521039">The reason they did not allow the Fundamental School at Audubon was because it was a segregating act on the part of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.860" offset="6558760">What it did was it put the burden on the blacks who under the Pasadena Plan were supposed to, ideally to be able to walk to their own elementary school for half the time and ride if they so chose the other half the time, but not this Fundamental School.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.747" offset="6622289">What that required was at that these blacks who were going to that school ride the bus the whole seven years of the their schooling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.859" offset="6650815">And that that is why the trial court said no I am not going to allow this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.237" offset="6668265">You got to make that burden equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.975" offset="6675266">Then you can have the Fundamental School and he said, “do no worry, go ahead and do it” in McKinley.</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.588" offset="6805669">Talking again about Audubon, the Court asked the superintendent whether or not he had ever recommended to the board that they come in and ask for relief from the no majority of no minority, the superintendent answered yes he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.777" offset="6866482">I think it was three times to the former President of Board orally and once to the present board in writing and the board still had not gone in to ask for that relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.037" offset="7043488">But as to the record I will have to rely I think upon our briefs and upon this Court’s own examination of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.696" offset="7086120">Let me correct one thing that I think is of importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.911" offset="7102942">It is not true that Board never asked for modification of the no majority no minority requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.687" offset="7142126">That appears explicitly on the motion that the 233 of the record, the first paragraph of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.693" offset="7182146">I think I would like to take this few instances that I have to speak to Mr. Bork’s position which I find somewhat perplexing because as I understand it, he thinks we are really entitled to the relief that we are asking, but he is confident that it has already been granted by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.257" offset="7288307">I think an examination of the opinions of the Court of Appeals will make clear that it was only Judge Chambers, who said if we redistricted once more we would be entitled to be free of that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.703" offset="7354136">Neither he nor Judge Ely addressed himself to the question at what point we would be entitled to be relieved from active judicial supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.168" offset="7396036">Mr. Bork, if Mr. Bork thinks that all we need to do now is go back before Judge Real (ph) and say everything is over and the Court of Appeals said that, Mr. Bork is simply unfamiliar with the course of the School Boards relationships with Judge Real and this entire proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.553" offset="7489555">And I think any such notion is totally dispelled if the Court will take a look at any part of the record on the Audubon proceeding which is before this Court and I would like to point out one thing in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.588" offset="7557682">There was testimony from that Audubon proceeding that was relied upon in a government brief which is cited at page 13 or 15 of the government brief and it was on the basis of that inclusion in the government’s brief that I asked the Solicitor General, if he would lodge the entire record and the record is lodged and we have discussed it in our reply brief and I think that should completely dispel any notion that this problem can be eradicated by merely sending the case back without this Court saying anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.680" offset="7710028">So, in conclusion, I would simply like to re-emphasize two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.397" offset="7724866">The Courts below have clearly misconceived the Swann decision, What that case said might be taken as inappropriate starting point as has been made in this case, the end point, the total objective of the remedial process and apparently for an indefinite period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.378" offset="7808876">Aside from that fatal flaw, the judgment should at the very least be remanded with some guidance from this Court as to when and how the School Board will have satisfied the requirement that it be a unitary district so that it can be released from the straight jacket that has been in for now six years.</text>
