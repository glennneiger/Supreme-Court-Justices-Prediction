            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73691">The judgment and opinion of the Court in 75-1124 and 74-1110, Simon, the Secretary of Treasury against the Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organizations and the related case will be announced by Mr. Justice Powell.</text>

            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="21.420" offset="159268">These cases are here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.650" offset="184241">The plaintiffs are indigents and their organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.424" offset="199288">They brought this class action against the Secretary of the Treasury and the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.212" offset="226455">They attack the validity of the IRS revenue ruling that extends favorable tax treatment to non profit hospitals that generally serve the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.819" offset="272953">Ruling entitles donors to take tax deductions on gifts to these hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.524" offset="299702">The ruling applies, even though indigents are not served.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.019" offset="317675">The Court of Appeals sustained the validity of the tax ruling, but we do not reach the merits and we conclude that the plaintiffs did not allege a case or controversy under Article III of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.073" offset="373890">Although they do allege denial of hospital services, because of their indigency they failed to name any hospital as a defendant, the only defendants are treasury officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.416" offset="427284">Nor does it complaint aver that the hospitals that denied the service were dependent upon tax deductible contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.074" offset="465946">Thus it is wholly speculative, so far as the complaint shows, whether the tax rulings bears any relation to denial of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.930" offset="509309">We conclude, therefore, that respondents failed to establish their standing to bring this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.790" offset="536790">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore, vacated and the case remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.006" offset="557688">Mr. Justice Stewart filed a concurrent opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.102" offset="570018">Mr. Justice Brennan filed a dissenting opinion, concurring in the judgment in which Mr. Justice Marshall joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.967" offset="601469">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration of decisions of the case.</text>
