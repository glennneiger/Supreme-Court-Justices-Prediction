            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="17.509" offset="173372">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.025" offset="187374">This case is here on petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which affirmed that judgment of the United States District Court suppressing for Use in evidence in respondent’s perjury prosecution, the testimony that he gave before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.054" offset="267517">In March of 1973, Officer Cavalier, a San Antonio Policeman who was assigned to undercover narcotics duty heard that respondent was involved in heroine transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.064" offset="323524">And on the afternoon of March 29, he went to the bar at which respondent was employed and attempted to purchase heroine from respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.893" offset="366887">Respondent made several phone calls to try to locate some heroine apparently unsuccessfully and then suggested that the officer give him $650.00 and he would go out and attempt to procure an ounce of heroine.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.294" offset="424461">About an hour later, respondent returned to the bar and said he had been unable to procure the heroine and returned the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.809" offset="450584">But said that his regular connection would be by later in the day and if that the officer called back that evening, he would be able to get some heroine.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.033" offset="491439">The officer did call that evening but respondent was out.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.317" offset="504605">He was unable to reach him and he thereupon dropped the matter at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.687" offset="530100">During the month of April, a grand jury was being planned to investigate into narcotics traffic in the San Antonio area.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.549" offset="565522">And in connection with the planning for the grand jury, Officer Cavalier was asked for any suggestions for witnesses who might be called before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.370" offset="608781">Cavalier told the prosecutor about his aborted heroine transaction with the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.935" offset="627067">Noted that he believed respondent had a regular source for heroine and that respondent was apparently aware of several other sources whom he had attempted to call.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.475" offset="665206">Accordingly, the prosecutor determined that respondent might be able to provide the grand jury with valuable information about local narcotics traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.029" offset="699478">As the prosecutor later testified without contradiction at the hearing in the District Court, he had no intention whatsoever at that time of indicting respondent for any narcotics offenses, at least in part, because he did not realize that respondent had committed any offenses. Respondent was subpoenaed and appeared before the grand jury on May 2nd, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.938" offset="791116">At the outset of his appearance there was a colloquy between the prosecutor who was conducting the grand jury and respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.313" offset="820582">During the course of which respondent was three times advised that he was not required to answer questions that would tend to incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.548" offset="861542">Page 6 of the appendix for example, the prosecutor said “You do not have to answer questions which would incriminate you.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.892" offset="894874">All other questions you have to answer openly and truthfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.660" offset="909921">And of course if you do not answer those truthfully, in other words if you lie about certain questions, you could possibly be charged with perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.202" offset="936148">Do you understand that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="210.033" offset="943462">And respondent said, “He did understand.”</text>
            <text syncTime="213.168" offset="956001">Then the subject of the lawyer came up and that matter was summarized by the prosecutor to respondent essentially as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.602" offset="985676">“If you would like to have a lawyer, this is again on page 6 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.178" offset="999991">He cannot be inside this room.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.735" offset="1006260">He can only be outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.336" offset="1012634">You would be free to consult with him if you so chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.675" offset="1026009">Now if during the course of this investigation, the questions that we asked you if you feel you would like to have a lawyer outside to talk to, let me know.”</text>
            <text syncTime="239.526" offset="1061431">“Yes sir,” said the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.232" offset="1068223">“Is that clear?” And respondent nodded affirmatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.546" offset="1085464">Now, in order to lay a foundation for broader questions designed to illicit the names of drug traffickers in the San Antonio area with whom respondent may have had dealings and to gauge the truthfulness of subsequent responses to those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.692" offset="1142097">The prosecutor asked a number of questions covering in part ground already known, including the incident with Officer Cavalier.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.491" offset="1173235">Respondent while admitting some use of heroine, denied knowing the names of any local heroin traffickers except someone whose first name he could supply.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.735" offset="1486286">He said, do I answer all the questions you ask?</text>
            <text syncTime="348.824" offset="1498616">The prosecutor said you have to answer all the questions except for those you think will incriminate you in the commission of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.881" offset="1522858">I think there is no basis for concluding that he did not understand, although it is a matter of speculation what exactly he thought that meant since he himself did not say it back to the prosecutor what he understood it to mean.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="378.507" offset="1617317">I think that the appendix does not reveal any substantial difficulty in understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.893" offset="1642917">Although, of course under our argument, even if he did not understand that would not be critical to the voluntariness of the testimony that he gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.971" offset="1691191">In any event, respondent admitted some past Use of heroine but he denied having discussed with anyone during the past year, the procurement of heroine or having taken any money for the purpose of attempting to procure some.</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="425.207" stopTime="781.831">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="425.207" offset="1804144">Well, the prosecutor explained that.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.402" offset="1812922">That is at page 45 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.445" offset="1825042">He was asked why he did that and his answer at the bottom of page 45.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.170" offset="1843955">I do not believe we subpoenaed any witness but we did not have an existing body of knowledge about.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.089" offset="1863704">And then virtually every case, we would ask questions about the facts that we did have.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.609" offset="1881780">That was number one, a method to gauge the truthfulness of the person’s testimony and number two, was in the nature of a natural progression to result in answers to the ultimate question.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.983" offset="1923263">A simple example of that might be if a person is a heroine addict, he obviously has to have a source of supply and you would say are you an addict and his answer might be yes, the natural question to follow that would be who do you purchase heroine from?</text>
            <text syncTime="467.338" offset="1972686">It seems to me quite logical to establish a foundation for the grand jury’s crediting his testimony to cover the background and show the nature of his contacts and his dealings in the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.301" offset="2036530">And of course, we think it is clear that he would not have been indicted although one may say that that is specular have he cooperated with the grand jury because the grand jury was looking at major traffickers, the people who were his connections, his sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.789" offset="2114479">In any event, he denied both having talked about the procurement of heroine and having taken any money for the purpose of attempting to get heroine.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.631" offset="2145826">And the prosecutor warned him that according to the information the prosecutor had, he could tell the grand jury more than he was telling them.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.767" offset="2178427">Respondent denied having any further knowledge in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.541" offset="2201519">Prosecutor then was preparing a perjury indictment against respondent and in the course of that he was unclear whether according to his testimony again whether it should be returned in one count or three since they were three false answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.648" offset="2261914">He discussed that with another attorney in the United States Attorney’s Office who pointed out to him that respondent’s actions might also constitute an attempt under the narcotics statute and the prosecutor decided at that time according to his testimony, to add the attempt charged to the indictment and that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.049" offset="2343521">The District Court granted respondent’s motion to suppress his grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.444" offset="2361075">He found that respondent had been a putative defendant at the time he was called to appear before the grand jury and that as such his questioning before the grand jury must be deemed custodial interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.335" offset="2404647">Therefore, the District Court concluded he was entitled to full Miranda Warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.344" offset="2420739">Since he did not receive the full warnings the questioning was improper and his answer should be suppressed from any Use including as here from forming the basis of a perjury charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.803" offset="2462535">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.763" offset="2470371">He adapted the finding of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.573" offset="2477581">The respondent was a putative defendant that therefore his interrogation was custodial and he was entitled to full Miranda Warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.637" offset="2509868">The opinion of the Court of Appeals reflects what we view as a rather disturbing approach toward the function of the grand jury and one that we think is quite inconsistent with the views expressed on numerous occasions by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.846" offset="2566711">While the requirement imposed that simply the giving of Miranda Warnings, the opinion reflects a basic hostility to the practice of calling as a grand jury witness persons who according to information on the government’s possession have some involvement in the activities under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.013" offset="2631390">For instance, if you look at the appendix at page 15(a), the Court says this is toward the top to the certiorari petition that is correct, I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.005" offset="2683322">In order to deter the prosecuting officers from bringing a putative or virtual defendant before the grand jury for the purpose of obtaining incriminating and perjurious testimony, the accused must be adequately apprised of his rights for all of his testimony incriminating and perjurious will be suppressed and at page 19(a) the entire proceedings which led up to Mandujano’s indictment for perjury where as we have noted repeatedly beyond the pale of permissible prosecutorial conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.803" offset="2794499">We conclude that the entire proceeding was a violation of Mandujano’s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.389" offset="2816860">The same theme is echoed in United States against Wang which is the Ninth Circuit decision in which there is a pending certiorari petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.165" offset="2851968">Now, ostensibly the Court of Appeals is talking about cases in which a witness is called for the purpose of getting him to incriminate himself or perjury himself but the application of its strong language, the facts of this case reflect how far its holding really goes in practical application.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.354" offset="2936709">Now, we submit that the approach of the Court of Appeals strikes at the heart of the effective functioning of the investigator grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.131" offset="2963877">That body is in that capacity attempting to ferried out secret crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.492" offset="2985297">How can they do this without obtaining the cooperation of those persons who have at least some peripheral involvement in the criminal activity under investigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="729.224" offset="3020197">In the San Francisco investigation of Police Corruption, a person such as Rose Wang who was apparently involved in gambling activities and thought to have made payoffs to police, is the very kind of person whose cooperation is absolutely essential to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.380" offset="3088846">Here a person like Mandujano who is tied into major heroin dealings in the San Antonio areas, a person whose cooperation is vital to the success of the grand jury’s undertaking.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="783.482" offset="3237222">These grounds briefly summarize as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.138" offset="3251851">First we say, the constitution is not violated by eliciting voluntary grand jury testimony of any person, ordinary witness or putative defendant without warnings of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.395" offset="3300856">Second, we say if some kind of warning is required, respondent received an adequate warning in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.525" offset="3329382">Third we say, respondent was not in fact a putative defendant and the Court of Appeals and the District Court applied an erroneous standard which would be very damaging, if the putative defendant notion were allowed to enter the law of this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.575" offset="3393643">Fourth, we say, even if the questioning was improper, respondent could not answer with perjuriously and it therefore has not remedy on a perjury prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.913" offset="3438992">And fifth, a related contention, this is in any event not inappropriate occasion for application of an exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.879" offset="3474832">There is no demonstrated basis for believing that if the Court announces a standard for prosecutors in this area, those standards would not be followed in virtually every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.070" offset="3519553">Because these points cover a great deal of ground and because very little time is available for me to cover them all, I invite the Court to feel free to interrupt at anytime with questions about any aspect of the case that may be of particular interest or concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="1106.200" offset="4528089">As far as I know although there has been some law review articles that have suggested people should have their attorneys in with them in the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.649" offset="4557868">There are problems of grand jury secrecy and there are problems under the rules of criminal procedure about allowing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.159" offset="4591932">Now, I think the main constitutional point in this case is that the proposition that any grand jury witness whether or not he is a putative defendant is not entitled to any advisive rights under the constitution and he is certainly not entitled to full Miranda Warnings which would we say entail a significant misstatement of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.245" offset="4680331">The opinion of the Court of Appeals is hazy as to whether its contrary conclusion is rooted under the self-incrimination provision or the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.884" offset="4718887">Or because of the substantial congruity of its approach with Miranda, it seems most useful here to treat it as resting principally on self-incrimination as far as the need for warnings themselves is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.911" offset="4770923">In determining whether what transpired in this case, in fringe respondent’s self–incrimination rights, it seems to me useful to begin with something the Court of Appeals overlooked, the language of the constitutional provision itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.426" offset="4820974">No person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.100" offset="4843753">We were accused by one of the amicus briefs of ignoring Johnson against Zerbst Standard of knowing in deliberate waiver and addressing ourselves to compulsion only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.129" offset="4883877">It is they however not we who have put the Court before the constitutional horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.918" offset="4902998">For if there is no compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.994" offset="4911253">There can be no violation of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.229" offset="4924210">This Court has spoken on several occasions a background jury testimony and compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.129" offset="4943854">For instance in the Monia case in 317 U.S., it said a grand jury witness must claim the privilege or he will not be considered to what has been compelled within the meaning of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.026" offset="4987426">And there are a number of other cases to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.528" offset="5001428">We submit that this proposition does not alter simply because the witness is a putative defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.199" offset="5024102">Indeed in the Dionisio case, this Court recognized that the obligations to appear before the grand jury which is the one element of compulsion to which respondent was subject is no different for a purpose who may be himself be the subject of the grand jury’s inquiry than for any other witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.016" offset="5095364">The Court of Appeals analogy to Miranda is an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.148" offset="5111873">You cannot equate incommunicado custodial police interrogation with grand jury question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.593" offset="5137682">I hardly need to rehearse the litany of concerns expressed in Miranda that are simply inapplicable to grand jury questioning before 23 fellow citizens who whatever else they may be are surely not so compliant to the prosecutors wishes that they would countenance the kinds of interrogative practices cataloged in Miranda as means of overcoming the arrested individual’s will and extracting a statement from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.664" offset="5237993">Moreover, because you have these citizen witnesses to what transpired and because in many cases including this you have a transcript of proceedings, you do not have the problem of reconstructing what happened, the problem of being unable to establish the kinds of improper techniques that may have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.070" offset="5319599">Moreover, the putative defendant notion is not useful in making the critical constitutional inquiry into compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.568" offset="5345617">The presence or absence of impermissible compulsion is a determination that turns on the state of mind of the individual upon the question whether in the circumstances; it is likely that his will was overborne.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.996" offset="5395250">The grand jury questioning is to be equated with incommunicado police interrogation as inherently coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.816" offset="5418551">It is difficult to see why it is more coercive of putative defendants than of other witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.209" offset="5440180">Indeed the putative defendant concept really has no application in Miranda either certainly if you were arrested and taken down to the back room of the station house even if the police had no reason whatsoever for doing it or simple harassment and were not planning to charge us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.194" offset="5504128">We would be entitled to Miranda Warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.545" offset="5521473">Now, let suppose for a minute that some kind of warning is deemed appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.552" offset="5557522">Should it be full Miranda Warnings?</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.052" offset="5567553">We think certainly not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.455" offset="5577166">Our most substantial objection to the Miranda Warnings in the area where we feel it most significantly misstates what the witnesses rights are is the absolute right to silence which is suggested in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.624" offset="5637771">Now, analytically it is not clear whether right to silence comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.708" offset="5658146">It is clear however that the police have no power to compel anyone to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.084" offset="5675700">They are not the people in our legal system who are vested with that power and therefore in a correlative sense, the arrested person has an absolute right to speak since there is no lawful or an absolute right to remain silent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.624" offset="7405842">I would just like to first of all direct the Court’s attention to the question raised by the Fifth Amendment due process and that is the compulsion whether or not in this case, Roy Mandujano can be a witness against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.878" offset="7478776">In this case, I feel that he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.461" offset="7505108">The question that under rides the whole issue before the Court is whether or not a grand jury is inherently coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.338" offset="7548680">And if we look at the facts of this case, we will find that Roy Mandujano was subpoenaed compelled against his will to appear before the grand jury to ask to answer specific questions about that which the government already had enough information on which the basis to base an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.604" offset="7641780">Number two, when Mr. Mandujano appeared before the grand jury, the special prosecutor informed Mr. Mandujano that this was a special grand jury and the attention that the grand jury was covering was limited to narcotics traffic, IRS evasions, and violations of the gun law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.450" offset="7753062">And if the Court will note the appendix, before they even approach the subject matter of the gun or IRS violations, they have pretty well ran Mr. Mandujano through the gamut of questionings through some 15 pages prior to even going into the information upon which they already had enough evidence to indict Mr. Mandujano.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.669" offset="7910006">Mr. Mandujano indeed when he appeared clearly, the Escobedo Rule which is incorporated in the Miranda, the whole focus of the investigation was upon Mr. Mandujano and the warnings that are recorded in the appendix clearly are insufficient in any way shape or form as Miranda applies and I would even urge that in addition to the regular Miranda Warnings that Mr. Mandujano should have been informed that he was indeed himself the focus of a specific investigation and on which they already have sufficient evidence to indict him.</text>
