            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103356">We will hear arguments first this morning in 75-5014, Doyle against Ohio and 5015 Wood against Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.448" offset="181096">Mr. Willis.</text>

          <turn speaker="james_r_willis" startTime="20.940" stopTime="738.936">
            <label>Mr. James R. Willis</label>
            <text syncTime="20.940" offset="187052">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.220" offset="204189">Jefferson Doyle and Richard Wood, the petitioners in this case, were convicted and sentenced to serve penal terms of 20-40 years for the sale of Marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.152" offset="267927">This Court granted certiorari to consider among other things, the question left unanswered in US versus Hale that is the whether Constitution prohibits the persecution from showing that one who had been advised of his right of silence end up his right of counsel, properly subjects himself to questions designed to show he availed himself of such rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.215" offset="388195">Also involved here are serious questions as to whether an accused can be asked why he failed to disclose his defense at the preliminary hearing where he appeared with counsel, and whether a defense witness arrested and charged with same offense can be asked comparable questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.689" offset="478056">These include why they did not consent to a search of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.590" offset="501671">Then there is the further fact that these points where vigorously argued to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.208" offset="532182">The relevant facts are not in serious dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.161" offset="551931">Doyle and Wood were arrested shortly after they had been seen emerging from a parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.253" offset="592368">An informer had preceded them; he was carrying a 10 pound bag of marijuana which he indicated had been purchased from the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.341" offset="640643">Their defense was that they had been framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.079" offset="655585">The fact shows that they had driven about the city, according to their defense, in search of the person who had framed them and they were stopped and arrested by the local police who were aided by the sheriff’s department.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.386" offset="716816">The Court of Appeals expressly viewed the asking of the assailed questions as properly designed to test credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.216" offset="760179">The related arguments were approved on the basis of this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.713" offset="786197">In a nutshell, we contend here that to the extent, Raffel may have somehow survived as a viable concept, this Court’s decision in Johnson, Grunewald and Griffin may have even been invigorated by Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.506" offset="861325">This Court’s decisions in Miranda and Hale, certainly when viewed in tandem, mandate that Raffel should be expressly relegated to the archives of antiquity.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.005" offset="919317">The state and the government, in its amicus brief, would have this Court declare in spite of the clear and ambiguous thrust of Miranda and Griffin that the failure of an accused base on his right of silence and to counsel to reveal the details of his defense during police interrogation is a factor that bears on creditability.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.407" offset="1020881">While it is doubtless truth that the Grunewald, Hale conclusion that mere silence is not inconsistent with innocence is a valid premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.113" offset="1067797">It is also true that a request to consult with counsel should not create a negative force against the believability of exculpatory defense as was the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.002" offset="1123281">Raffel of course held that it was proper to show at a subsequent trial that the accused did not testify at his first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.370" offset="1160793">For me, it is most difficult to square Raffel with the Griffin principle that one cannot be penalized for not having testified and the elementary fairness concept expressed in Johnson makes the fact that the Miranda warnings were given these petitioners a most crucial consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.146" offset="1255878">The same as true of Grunewald as it is hard to see how this Court’s supervisory powers of the lower Federal Courts could possibly be more sensitive to the rights of an accused to a fair trial then it is to Constitution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.592" offset="1325678">As counsel reads Hale absent a on a duty to speak and absent a threshold inconsistency between a failure to do so and later exculpatory testimony, proof of silence, lacks a significance probative value and should be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.298" offset="1408538">Here of course, as was the case in Grunewald, the focus on Doyle and Wood following their arrest was so intense that it was natural for them to feel they were being questioned solely for the purpose of providing evidence that could be uses against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.018" offset="1483353">Indeed, there is simply no basis in this record even for the strained hope by them that the revelation of their defense to the police during interrogation could have possibly resulted in their arrest -- in their release.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.819" offset="1550540">Raffel, of course, was based on an assumption rejected in Grunewald and again in Hale that silence is inconsistent with a later exculpatory defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.590" offset="1609681">But as the Court has recognized, and I think it is salient here that there is simply no proof that an innocent person would tend to make an exculpatory statement whereas the guilty person will remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.787" offset="1690452">We contend that it there is something wrong with the rule which permits the conversion of one’s permissible use of Fifth Amendments shield into evidence of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.540" offset="1745413">This, of course, is the point made in the concurring opinion in Grunewald which, we contend, was adapted in Griffin and certainly impeachment tends to demonstrate it is untruth by implication which was a point made in one of the concurring opinions in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.035" offset="1835483">The interesting aspect of this case, of course, lies in the fact that in Ohio there were decisions which had expressly excluded the ability of the prosecutor to comment on the failure of a person to appear before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.450" offset="1897132">The Supreme Court of Ohio had indicated that this of course was improper and then no amount of instruction could cure of this fault on the part of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.918" offset="1934958">There were decisions which indicated it was impermissible to comment on the fact that one did not reveal his defense at a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.512" offset="1969335">Again, the Supreme Court of Ohio take into position that any instruction was insufficient and then there was the Stevens case out of Ohio which indicated that it was impermissible to argue to the jury that at a point of arrest would have been a good time for the defendant to have revealed his exculpatory defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.160" offset="2051986">There was a statute in Ohio which was of course applicable at the time this case was tried and that statute expressly provided that when an accused person appeared at a preliminary hearing without counsel, he should be expressly advised that the he need not make any statement and the failure to make a statement could not be used against him at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.754" offset="2142370">Thus, we have the anomalous situation where one appears with counsel and he is of course of penalized because he did not reveal his defense at the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.515" offset="2193361">To put the issue in its proper context, I think, that a slight emphasis should be given to some of the questions that were asked of Mr. Wood and Mr. Doyle.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.859" offset="2234739">The point of course is that Doyle was tried -- Wood was tried first, Doyle appeared as a witness in the Wood case.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.994" offset="2271310">Doyle was tried and Wood appeared as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.788" offset="2286461">So that we do have a sophisticated aspect of some of the questions which deal with whether or not the same standards applied to a witness who appears testifying in the defense of a co-defendant or whether or not the Fifth Amendments right of silence which also was given to him at the time of his arrest is to be exposed to the jury to impeach his credibility when he appears as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.835" offset="2394608">The Trial Court in ruling on emotion for judgment of acquittal a post trial indicated that different rules applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.240" offset="2424283">We contend that the rights have not been given to both these defendants and both having indicated that they desired to rely on their rights and they wanted to consult with an attorney, that it does not make any difference whether he appears at the post trial -- whether he appears at the trial post indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.947" offset="2499098">It does not make any difference whether he appears as a witness or as a defendant that the implications are exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.372" offset="2532744">In this case, when Doyle and Wood were stopped, the officer indicated, and it is a fact that he told them they have the right to remain silent and they have right to consult an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.142" offset="2579869">Both indicated that they wanted to consult an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.656" offset="2593975">Later, they came to the incarceration area and indicated to Wood, you do not have any objections to us searching your car.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.364" offset="2624799">He said I want to consult with an attorney about that and that was his evidence on the point, and Doyle of course gave comparable indications.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.446" offset="2665132">Then, of course, the State then went to the problem of getting a search warrant and they located in the car some money and of course they were asked at the trial, why did you not consent to the search of the car and why was it that you did not reveal this frame defense to the police on the night of the arrest?</text>
            <text syncTime="661.397" offset="2748933">Why, when you appeared at the preliminary hearing, did you not reveal the contents of your defense?</text>
            <text syncTime="669.306" offset="2780489">And the question about the counsel was brought before by questions asked of one of the petitioners is why did you not relate the essence of your defense and he indicated that I wanted to consult with an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.944" offset="2835033">So while you appeared at the preliminary hearing, you had an attorney at that time, did you not?</text>
            <text syncTime="686.152" offset="2847885">And he said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.560" offset="2853527">And why did you not tell the judge at that preliminary hearing that you have been framed and would that not have been a wonderful time to have revealed to the judge that you have been framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.198" offset="2904100">And all these questions of course were asked over objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.789" offset="2922491">The only instruction given to Court related to the testimony of one who appeared on as rebuttal witness in the Wood trial, he was asked on the rebuttal that Mr. Wood, at anytime, protests his innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.578" offset="2981632">And we again objected and the Court indicated that -- did Mr. Doyle at anytime protests his innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.222" offset="3004202">Doyle testifying as a witness in the Wood trial, and the Court instructed the jury that that went to impeach the credibility of Mr. Doyle who had appeared as a witness on behalf of Mr. Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.112" offset="3055715">Yes, sir?</text>

            <text syncTime="776.960" offset="3211196">I would say so, in the line of Harris versus New York, the position taken by the Court there of course related to inconsistent statements, which were at variance with the later defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.058" offset="3267516">I think, although I am not in agreement necessarily with Harris, but given Harris, I do not think that this case would turn on that point because here --</text>

            <text syncTime="802.515" offset="3313387">Well, there could ever be a case in which silence would be inconsistent with trial testimony?</text>

            <label>Mr. James R. Willis</label>
            <text syncTime="808.686" offset="3338047">I would suppose so.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.788" offset="3342435">Using the Third Circuit’s case of USL, the Bird case, whatever it is, there the indication was that the man was arrested and at sometimes after a person had been killed and later he was charged with a murder and his defense was accident and he was questioned as to whether or not why he had not reported the fact that he had accidentally injured someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.871" offset="3438775">I think in that instance, at least I could live with that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.493" offset="3449328">And there is the Fifth Circuit Opinion in Ramirez whether person testified a trial that he was coerced in selling the contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.479" offset="3489243">I think there, I can see how he might have been under some duty to speak, and I think that is the point, absent a duty to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.383" offset="3532816">I have problems with it and I have even greater problems when the man has given the Miranda warning which is to the effect that he has the right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.225" offset="3568238">And I think that he certainly can rely on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.438" offset="3581090">And there is an old opinion rendered by in the Sixth circuit I think it is the McCarthy and it is probably back in the 20s.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.129" offset="3611810">And the point there was made that if a person could be penalized for exercising his right of silence that you have to change the warning to read that anything that you say can be used against you and if you do not say anything that can be used against you too.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.306" offset="3672518">And I think that makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.310" offset="3680564">It just seems that there is something wrong to tell a man you have the right to remain silent and you have the right to consult with an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.049" offset="3707523">And he says very good, I want to exercise those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.653" offset="3721942">And then later, he is penalized for having done so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.499" offset="6629266">Before we get into those matters, I do have one thing to indicate to the court less the court please on do emphasis on the matters as brought to the attention of Court by Mr. Willis, the defendant’s being sentenced to 20-40 years in penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.689" offset="6698020">As the Court is aware in the case of Downey versus Perini which has been sent back to the Sixth Circuit into Ohio for further determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.834" offset="6734592">Ohio has retroactively changed its penalties in marijuana cases and this will apply to these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.978" offset="6771268">As Mr. Willis pointed out to the Court, the facts here are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.258" offset="6792375">I think they are complicated only by the disbelieved testimony of the petitioners to the defendants below and that they are very important facts are very important in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.684" offset="6834066">I think they are important in light of Mr. Willis’s concession here that inconsistency turns this case and that Ramirez is such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.427" offset="6877012">We contend it is but a short step and perhaps even backwards from Ramirez to our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.500" offset="6909299">In the facts of our case, on April 28, 1973, the informant notified in Multi-County Narcotics Bureau, which is the local bureau in our County, Tuscarawas County, Ohio that he had set up a deal with one of the defendants, Mr. Jefferson Doyle to purchase a quantity of marijuana from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.930" offset="6999056">The deal was for 10 pounds of marijuana, of course it is sackful  as it turned out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.171" offset="7019954">The price is to be $175 a pound or $1750 for the 10 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.478" offset="7065198">The Bureau had trouble getting this amount of money and on the short notice that they had, however, they did get some amount of it $1520 or $1540 as I recall and had some part of that money photocopied so that they had the serial numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.960" offset="7143147">The informant was searched so that they found no drugs on him and the surveillance team, in fact several surveillance teams were set up to watch the informant as he went to his rendezvous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.646" offset="7189854">The photocopied money or – some of the money was photocopied and all was what given to him including the photocopied money and he set off for his rendezvous with the petitioners, the defendants below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.704" offset="7246069">The exchange was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.540" offset="7253488">The informant gave the defendants his money and the defendants gave the informant the marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.223" offset="7288179">Later, after search warrant, the money including that which was photocopied was found in the rented – the locked rented car of the petitioners bowled up under the floor mat, the passenger side of that car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.657" offset="7369890">Had trial and the trial testimony of the defendants they testified for in their own behalf in separate trials and each other’s behalf as witnesses in the separate trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.889" offset="7410850">Their testimony essentially was that they were involved in this matter but it was only of the defendants, Mr. Doyle who wanted to buy marijuana not to sell it and that it was the informant who I might pointed out, the evidence showed knew he was under surveillance at the time this rendezvous took place was framing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.905" offset="7502905">The informant was framing by the defendants that the marijuana was his 10 pounds not the defendant’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.034" offset="7535402">That the money -- how did they explain the money</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.526" offset="7545433">?Well, apparently it had been thrown in the window and to the backseat at the time that they turned down the deal to purchase the marijuana, according to their story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.467" offset="7589214">Then it was their testimonies that day after they left this rendezvous, they discovered this money in the backseat and think scared, not knowing what to do, they hid it under the floor mat, yes they did hide it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.493" offset="7865276">The petitioners also went on to testify in their part of their case that they were trying and they were chasing this informant after they found that money to find out what is going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.488" offset="8009263">At this point, they were picked up and they did not talk to law enforcement officers who did pick them up who had found out about this through the informant going to the sheriff’s department and later a radio communication telling them – telling the other officers of what had happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.897" offset="8082928">At the trial, the prosecutor cross-examined on the silence of the defendants at the time they were arrested.</text>

            <text syncTime="2451.802" offset="9910559">If that was anything, it was a due process case and that is the same thing I think this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.255" offset="9944309">The second point is a related point and that is in light of the trial testimony of the defendants, their silence at the time of their arrest became conduct, because here they are with this marked money, this photocopied money in their car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.025" offset="10027379">They have all these things that they have testified to and then which were set out in detail, and I do not want to dwell on the facts anymore, which made them, -- this conduct made them voiceless in the presence of the realities that they were facing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.524" offset="10085371">A third point is related to this as well that the prosecutor asked about, and this has been a question before, asked about the defendant’s silence not to show guilt but to show that they were lying on the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.963" offset="10143154">I think the fourth point I would like to stress here is, in my view, Miranda has no proper application to either Hale or to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.160" offset="10179934">The warnings in Hale and in this case were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.478" offset="10193204">They were heeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.687" offset="10198011">The defendants said nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.261" offset="10208355">I contend that there is a different line of cases here, entirely separate from Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.614" offset="10225805">Raffel versus United State, Grunewald versus United State, Harris versus New York and United State versus Hale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.370" offset="10264780">As a matter of fact, throughout the appellate argument at this case, State has relied on the language in Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.679" offset="10294037">I think the prosecution does have a right to rely on the language in Harris, some of which shows that Miranda does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.902" offset="10362896">The court at Page 224 in Harris had said some comments in the Miranda opinion can indeed be read as indicating a bar to use of an uncounseled statement for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.350" offset="10408662">The discussion of that issue was not at all necessary to the Court’s holding and cannot be regarded to this controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.022" offset="10431441">Miranda barred the prosecution for making its case with statements of an accused made while in custody prior to having or effectively waiving counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.449" offset="10465087">It does not follow from Miranda that evidence inadmissible against an accused in the prosecution’s case in chief is barred for all purposes provided of course that the trustworthiness of that evidence satisfies legal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.155" offset="10519944">I think the Miranda rationale is important here that of deterring improper police conduct and getting rid of coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.189" offset="10552022">Here, the conduct of the police was entirely proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.864" offset="10562785">They gave the Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.209" offset="10568114">It was no compulsion, no element of compulsion or coercion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.314" offset="10588594">The petitioners, the defendants made their free choice to take the witness stand at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.416" offset="10612940">They made the free choice to remain silent at the time of their arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.325" offset="10628613">And so that is an additional reason why I think there is no Fifth Amendment question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.331" offset="10644600">There is no element of compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.057" offset="10651496">There is no compelling at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.571" offset="10669573">Due process in the Constitution in my opinion amount to fairness, and I do not think that there is anything fair about presenting a lopsided version of truth to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.881" offset="10722863">I think that the defendants in this case, petitioners should not have been allowed to tell their story to the jury on impeded by being impeached by things which would go directly to the issue of whether there was a fabrication or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.904" offset="10818889">Was there a recent fabrication after these defendants had listened to the state’s case throughout the preliminary hearings, throughout discovery procedures and trial twice, two separate trials?</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.176" offset="10867999">I think the jury had a right to weigh the credibility of the defendants and I think that the proper -- the prosecution had properly used the silence given the facts and the nature of the defendant’s testimony as impeachment as showing that this was a recent fabrication that they did not have a story at the time they were arrested and now all of a sudden at trial they do have a story.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.552" offset="10989521">There should be a full and not just a selective development with the recent fabrication and credibility issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.165" offset="11015957">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2792.653" offset="11273942">Then at the preliminary hearing, he appears with the lawyer and makes no statement, no preliminary response at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2838.214" offset="11456172">I indicated that there were some cases, Burt versus New Jersey and Ramirez where the Court took the position that in those circumstances, it was inconsistent with innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.129" offset="11499849">I said I could see how the Court came to that conclusion although I do not agree with it, but I am indicating that this case is not even -- does not fall in that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.840" offset="11538615">This is different case in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.329" offset="11548646">My position is that silence can never, following the warnings that that eliminates any duties or impose that the accused might otherwise have to explain incriminating circumstances and that he has a right to rely on the warnings given to him by Miranda, and that would apply across the board in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.310" offset="11640492">That is the position I have attempted to assert here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.366" offset="11656793">Certainly, if these defendants had the right to remain silent, then the police did not have the right to create any evidence out of their exercise of the right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.802" offset="11718546">I feel that this Court’s decision in Hale ought to be applied full strength to the facts in the factual pattern involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.665" offset="11757939">Certainly, we have to concern ourselves about them asking these petitioners about consenting to the search of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.880" offset="11790853">I feel that they do not have to consent to the search of the car or ask Mr. Wood about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.605" offset="11817707">He was the lesser of the car and he indicated I want to discuss that with my attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.790" offset="11838500">Now, how can you then torture that legitimately in the light of Grunewald and these other cases than to some evidence that can be used against these particular petitioners?</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.769" offset="11886357">I feel that the Court ought to follow the suggestion made by Mr. Justice Black in his concurring opinion in Grunewald and ought to eliminate Raffel from the books of this Court as a viable opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.254" offset="11944349">Thank you.</text>
