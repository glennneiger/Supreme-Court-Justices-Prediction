            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103383">We will hear arguments first this morning in 73-2066, the National Independent Coal Operators’ Association against the Secretary of the Interior and the consolidated case, the Secretary of Interior against Delta Mining Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.029" offset="187497">Mr. Kilcullen, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. John L. Kilcullen</label>
            <text syncTime="25.187" offset="204111">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, these consolidated cases present a single legal issue as to whether the Bureau of Mines of the Department of Interior in assessing civil penalties for alleged violations of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act followed strictly the procedural requirements spelled out by Congress in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.643" offset="325946">The Act directs that the operator of a coal mine in which a violation occurs shall be assessed to civil penalty by the Secretary of the Interior in an amount not less than $10,000 for each violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.527" offset="385401">The penalty provisions of the statute are mandatory, i.e., the Secretary must assess penalty in each instance where he finds a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.053" offset="431585">In this respect, the Act differs from other occupational safety Acts such as OSHA which give the administrative agency discretion to assess penalties where a fault is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.198" offset="488114">Here, the statute requires in each case that a penalty be assessed regardless of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.531" offset="517476">Because of the mandatory nature of the penalty provisions of this statute, Congress wrote into the Act certain procedural safeguards which must be followed by the Secretary in assessing these penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.151" offset="583932">The Act expressly provides that a penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary only after a mine operator charged with the violation has had an opportunity for a public hearing and the Secretary has determined by decision incorporating findings of fact that a violation occurred and the amount of the penalty which is warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.482" offset="673270">The statute also requires that hearings be subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.936" offset="703050">In determining the amount of the penalty, the Secretary must consider six criteria spelled out in the statute: the operator’s prior record of violations, the size of his business, whether he was negligent, the gravity of the violation, his good faith effort to achieve compliance, and whether the penalty would affect his ability to continue in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.903" offset="802942">These cases are before the Court because the Secretary has not applied these procedural safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.264" offset="832408">Instead, he has adapted a summary type of procedure under which he has authorized the Bureau of Mines to issue a proposed order, a proposed assessment, in advance of any hearing or any finding or determination that a violation occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.840" offset="910671">Unless the mine operator request formal adjudication within a certain number of days after he receives such a proposed order, the order becomes final by its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.311" offset="960617">The Bureau of Mines’ Assessment Officer who issues these assessment orders is not a qualified administrative law judge nor does he have authority to hold hearings or adjudicate disputed issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.427" offset="1033029">On deposition, he admitted that he made no effort to determine whether a violation had in fact occurred, and he also admitted that in fixing the amount of the penalty he had simply followed a preset penalty schedule which gave no consideration to the six statutory criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.560" offset="1117561">In the National Independent Coal Operators’ case, the District Court found that the Assessment Officer gave no meaningful consideration to the six statutory criteria for determining penalties and that he made no independent determination as to whether the charged violation had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.620" offset="1185793">In the Delta Mining Group of cases, the District Courts refused enforcement of these penalty assessment orders on the same ground, that they were not based on a genuine determination as to the occurrence of a violation or consideration of the statutory criteria for determining the penalty amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.741" offset="1274296">Now, the Government has argued that the statutory language requires only that the mine operator be given an opportunity for a hearing, and if he does not request a hearing there is no need for a decision incorporating findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.869" offset="1342841">In other words, the procedural requirements of the Act are satisfied simply by advising the operator that he can request a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.314" offset="1376591">The balance of the Section which calls for determination, the Government says, becomes inoperative once he had been given this opportunity for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.674" offset="1418074">The District Courts in the cases below rejected this argument and held that in all cases, before an assessment order can become final, it must be supported by a decision incorporating the Secretary’s findings of fact that a violation did occur in the amount of the penalty which is warranted, and held that the procedures leading to the orders sought to be enforced by the Secretary did not comply with the requirements of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.075" offset="1539595">Mr. Kilcullen, isn’t your version of what Congress provided here rather elaborate by the standards of normal administrative law?</text>
            <text syncTime="368.372" offset="1576794">If Congress clearly provided it, certainly that is the way it ought to be, but if there is ambiguity, is there not some question as to whether this is a rather unusually elaborate proceeding?</text>

            <text syncTime="381.952" offset="1631128">I think that it simply follows the standard procedure for adjudicating penalties, any penalty, to be asserted against the citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.348" offset="1680761">There must be some adjudicative process and this is simply what the Congress provided here that there must be a determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.625" offset="1733842">But the statute says that the Secretary must apply these criteria in making a determination and unless he has done so, the operator’s failure to request a hearing does not validate or does not cure a Secretary’s failure to comply with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.402" offset="1832898">He has to find that there has been a violation, and having found that there is a violation, he must then decide what the amount of the penalty must be and in doing so, he has to take into account the six criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.206" offset="1896114">The procedure that has been followed here eliminates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.136" offset="1911892">It simply involves issuing a proposed order and advising the operator that if he does not request a hearing a proposed order becomes final.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.268" offset="2752408">In that circumstance, the matter would then go to an Administrative Law Judge who would take testimony and make findings and then further appeal from that to the Board of Mine Operations Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1193.162" offset="4875954">I want to emphasize that there is no consideration of health or safety of the minors attaching to the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.061" offset="4911585">The Coal Mine Inspector issues a notice to obey the condition which he considers unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.046" offset="4943559">That Inspector’s order must be obeyed within the time he allows for the correction, otherwise, the affected part of the mine is closed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.192" offset="4992147">So, there is absolutely no connection between this case and the safety actions which are taken in the day-to-day operations in the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.681" offset="5026106">The penalty assessment process comes many months after the condition has been corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.053" offset="5051497">I would also like to emphasize that we are not asking this Court to give us any due process protection beyond that already spelled out in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.864" offset="5090785">We merely ask that the Secretary be required to honor the expressed penalty assessment procedures that are already there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.885" offset="5130910">We contend that the penalty orders in these cases are invalid for a number of reasons, the major one of which is that the Secretary did not comply with Section 109 (a) (1) and (a) (3) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.504" offset="5197365">The first sentence in each of these provisions requires that a violation must occur before a penalty can be assessed, violation must occur before a penalty can be assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.843" offset="5250655">However, the testimony of the Secretary’s Assessment Officer, Mr. Everich Turner (ph), shows that no proper finding of violation has been made in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.400" offset="5292973">The Turner testimony, Appendix Page 93, shows that the Assessment Officer looked solely to the charge in the Inspector’s unsworn statement and assume on the basis of that that a violation had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.904" offset="5354936">No written finding of violation was put in the Assessment Order and in the Delta and G. M. W. cases no written finding that a violation had occurred was issued until long after the final penalty orders had been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.290" offset="5432467">In one instance, the finding of violation called almost one year and eight months after the penalty order was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.380" offset="5472800">The findings were never presented to the operators prior to the Secretary’s enforcement action and we saw the findings for the first time when we received the complaint as exhibits attached to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.332" offset="5536643">Moreover, these findings, when they did come, although it is an adjudicatory function to find such a violation, the findings were made by Mr. Everich Turner who is the Secretary’s Assessment Officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.949" offset="5603099">He is not a Hearing Officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.770" offset="5610413">He is not a Juridical Officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.261" offset="5620340">This penalty process was not under the jurisdiction of a Juridical Officer at any time during the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1397.827" offset="5694632">That is the Government -- the Government’s position is that there is a distinction in the penalty assessment procedure in a hearing and a non-hearing situation, that the statute simply does not contain such a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.919" offset="5771014">In fact, when the Secretary first implemented the Coal Act in 1970 his construction of the statute was the same as our construction here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="1974.421" offset="8001035">No, the regulations were held invalid in the Delta Mining case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.991" offset="8019321">The regulations under which the penalties were assessed were held invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.477" offset="8041264">These are the first cases obviously to reach the Court involving the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 and I might point out to the Court that this Act is a culmination of federal legislative efforts dealing with coal miners that dates back to 1865.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.325" offset="8104585">The purpose of the Act was to cure some of the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.297" offset="8120467">Many of the problems that led to the failure of past legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.460" offset="8141156">The purpose of the Act as well was to protect the coal miners, the primary purpose, to protect their health and safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.921" offset="8171040">Congress recognizing that they were engaged in the most hazardous occupation within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.583" offset="8193714">Congress found that between 1960 and 1968, under the passed law, that federal inspectors had observed 1.3 million violations of the Advisory Safety Code of the Bureau of Mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.475" offset="8273231">One of the major problems that Congress identified with, even enforcing the existing laws and this is in the Senate Report right at the very beginning of the report on this Bill, was that the enforcement procedures did not work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.386" offset="8320879">Congress said they were too complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.411" offset="8328924">They were too difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.786" offset="8334462">It made it impossible to secure compliance even with the laws that were on the books at that time and, therefore, Congress abandoned, in this Act, it abandoned the approach of seeking voluntary compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.750" offset="8382319">It imposed 125 specific mandatory standards of health and safety that coal mine operators must comply with, and it imposed penalties for violations of those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.103" offset="8435713">In order to make it no longer profitable for the coal mine operators to continue operating in violation of the law, to make it no longer profitable for them to operate in violation of health and safety standards at the expense of the miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.065" offset="8491615">The issue in this case is one statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.766" offset="8506348">And I will explain later that it goes beyond the particular regulations that are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.858" offset="8526723">The question specifically is what does Section 109 (a) (3) of this Act require when the Secretary assesses a penalty in the absence of a request or the holding of an administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.319" offset="8576565">More specifically written detailed findings of fact such as those required under the APA after a hearing, are those kinds of findings of fact required to be incorporated in the Secretary’s Assessment Order when there has been no hearing, and when, indeed, the mine operator is entitled to a trial de novo in a District Court on all issues and a trial by jury by all factual issues?</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.827" offset="8682622">Let me add right here at the outset that the statement that I believe Mr. Kilcullen quoted of the attorney in the pretrial proceedings in the Delta Mining case about what de novo means is not the position of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.068" offset="8747615">The position of the Government is that de novo trial on all issues means an absolute de novo trial on all issues of fact in law, that the administrative proceedings become irrelevant; they wash out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.217" offset="8808219">I would like to put this case in its proper prospective by just outlining for the Court the steps that lead to an assessment and finally the steps that lead into the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.048" offset="8851478">We begin with the Mine Inspectors themselves and these are people specifically required by the Act under Section 505 to be experienced people in mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.793" offset="8890452">All the people appointed by the Secretary to administer this Act are required by the statue itself to be experienced mining people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.976" offset="8923262">The Mine Inspector approaches the mine without any advance notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.385" offset="8936846">In fact, the statute specifically prevents him from giving any notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.908" offset="8954923">Each mine within the United States must be inspected entirely four times a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.614" offset="8973835">There are also spot inspections periodically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.321" offset="8984598">For dangerous mines where there had been fatalities or serious accidents within the past five years, there must be a spot check once out of every five days by a Mine Inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.570" offset="9025662">The Union representative has an absolute right to accompany the Mine Inspector when he reaches the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.866" offset="9046769">The company official, I am told, usually does as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.596" offset="9065682">Let us suppose the Mine Inspector goes into the mine shaft and, as in Delta Mining G. M. W. and the Mears Company mines, he finds violations of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.244" offset="9108314">At that point, he writes out a detailed notice of violation quite analogous, Mr. Chief Justice, to a traffic ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.376" offset="9136839">Under Section 104 (e) of the Act he is required to set down precisely what he finds is wrong, what sections of the Act where the regulations are violated, and then he also sets a time for abatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.801" offset="9194518">In this case, I notice in the Delta Mining situation the operator had one month to correct that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.629" offset="9221894">Now, this is handed, this notice of violation is required by the statute to be handed right there to the company official, but that is not all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.854" offset="9254704">The Act also requires specifically that the Mine Inspector post the notice of violation saying what was wrong and where in the mine and how long it is before it has to be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.794" offset="9306531">He must post that notice on a bulletin board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.807" offset="9318547">And, to give you an idea of how careful Congress was in this detailed Act, there is even a Section in the Act, 107 (a) that requires mine operators to have bulletin boards, so they would not get into the problem of having no place to post it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.658" offset="9373927">The bulletin boards must be right outside the mine entrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.010" offset="9391376">Then, the Mine Inspector returns to check to see whether there has been an abatement, to check and see whether the violation has in fact been remedied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.228" offset="9432232">If it has not, if there has been no abatement, then the Mine Inspector can order withdrawal of all people from the area of the violation or he can extend the time for correcting the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.457" offset="9489179">But let us suppose that the violation has been abated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.026" offset="9511435">If that is done then the notice of violation and the abatement notice is sent to the Assessment Office of the Bureau of Mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.383" offset="9544872">Now, what I have just described is happening, and I think we said in our brief, at the rate of 80,000 times a year, 80,000 violations of the health and safety standards of the Act and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.122" offset="9603804">That was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.773" offset="9610387">That figure is not accurate today because the latest figure shows that the rate has increased now to 110,000 violations a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.495" offset="9653332">Congress could have stopped right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.667" offset="9665976">It could have led the -- like a traffic office, it could have left the Mine Inspector write out a fine, serve it on the mine operator, and say “either pay it or litigate in District Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.676" offset="9718012">The APA would not have been applicable at all to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.939" offset="9735043">If the Court will notice, in Section 554 (a) (3) of the APA, it specifically made inapplicable the findings of a fact requirement, the hearing requirement to situations involving inspections, and that is precisely what this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.048" offset="9807559">It has also made inapplicable the APA requirements in finding of fact requirements until the applicable are totally inapplicable when there is a trial de novo in a District Court available, but Congress did not stop right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.290" offset="9860536">Now, it gave another step in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.728" offset="9874224">It required the Secretary himself to assess the penalties and it thought it advisable to give the mine operators an opportunity for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.673" offset="9921976">The way that has been operating, the way it operated under the old regulations is that the Assessment Officer would, after getting a notice of violation, the abatement would make up a proposed order of assessment, the Assessment Officer is a man, as I said, experienced in mining, and send it to the mine operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.034" offset="10003478">It is not an order to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.534" offset="10009434">He cannot be required to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.820" offset="10014658">It just says that you have 15 days to protest this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.604" offset="10029705">In the Delta Mining case, the addendum at Page 28 of our brief shows that there was a protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.251" offset="10056350">It was not on a basis that we did not violate the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.636" offset="10073904">There was no allegation in the protest that we have not violated the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.323" offset="10088637">It was that this is a new mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.824" offset="10102639">People have to be trained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.364" offset="10112774">We showed good faith in trying to abate, and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.121" offset="10127821">But let us assume in the usual case that the operator does protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.839" offset="10142658">If he does not protest the proposed Assessment Order, then the order becomes the final order of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.754" offset="10170348">He can request a hearing at this point but let us assume that he does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.465" offset="10185185">The Assessment Officer takes the protest from the mine operator, reconsiders, and let us assume, he reissues the assessment order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.331" offset="10216637">The mine operator, again, has the opportunity to request a hearing and I might add that if he does request a hearing, the hearing itself is de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.103" offset="10251745">Nothing that went on before is considered to be bearing one way or another in whether there is a violation and if he loses the hearing, I might add, he has the opportunity to appeal within the administrative process to the Board of Mine Operations Appeal, but let us assume he does not request a hearing because that is the situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.848" offset="10338681">If he does not request a hearing, then the order, the proposed order of assessment becomes the final order of the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.522" offset="10365430">Now, that sets forth the amount of the fine; it sets forth the regulations violated; it sets forth the days in which the notices of violation were issued and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.726" offset="10410256">I might add also that this is not all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.538" offset="10421437">This is not the mine operator’s only opportunity as to find out what he has been charged with and why he has been assessed a certain penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.891" offset="10450903">In fact, the old regulations, one of the most normal occurrences was that conferences were held, informal conferences, maybe as little as simply picking up of a telephone and calling the Assessment Officer and asking him “why the penalty you assessed against me was $25 instead of $50.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.470" offset="10557169">I would like to just finish up this summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.083" offset="10571693">In that effect, the GAO Report that surveyed the operations of the Assessment Office pointed out that for three Assessment Officers, 35% of their time was spent in informal conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.237" offset="10624252">Now, even after all of this, the Secretary cannot collect a cent from the mine operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.762" offset="10654345">He cannot collect anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.189" offset="10660092">He cannot force the mine operator to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.969" offset="10671167">He must go to the District Court where the trial is de novo on all relevant issues and, regarding issues of fact, the mine operators can request a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.838" offset="10710665">I noticed that Delta Mining and G. M. W., in fact, did request a jury trial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.762" offset="10730413">What this means is simply this that after all of these administrative proceedings, regardless of what went on during these administrative proceedings, as soon as the mine operator does not pay, they are all transformed into nothing more than a charge, an allegation, a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.187" offset="10804079">In a civil case, the administrative proceedings are not facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.078" offset="10823618">They are simply allegations to be proved like any other case in a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.015" offset="10851412">Now, the claim here is that the mine operator who never requested an administrative hearing can defend a de novo trial and enforcement action on the basis that the Secretary did not make adequate findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.286" offset="10904493">The relevant statute, 109 (a) (3) scarcely compelled such a result on its language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.456" offset="10961127">It is always difficult to argue orally whether a statute is plain on its face or it is not plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.372" offset="10988816">The very fact that Judges MacKinnon, Chief Justice Bazelon, Judge McGowan, and incidentally, I might add, the GAO itself in its report thought that the statute did not require written findings of fact when no hearing had been held is at least some evidence that reasonable men differ on whether the statute means one thing or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.759" offset="11078364">Our reading is that the findings of fact are necessary as to a violation and as to a penalty only after the mine operator has taken advantage of his opportunity for an APA type hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.201" offset="11136147">The Secretary himself has always read the statute this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.379" offset="11156836">There had been a number of statements in the argument that said that originally the Secretary read the statute the other way and required findings of fact in regard to every order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.437" offset="11201035">That is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.807" offset="11222560">The original regulations which were issued, and I might add, Saturday, March 28, 1970 were enjoined incidentally in a case called Radcliff v. Hickle (ph) in the Western District of Virginia in a suit by the mine operators so that these regulations did not go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.645" offset="11297897">I do not think a single penalty was assessed under them, but these original regulations which are contained in 35 Federal Register 5256 said only that the Hearing Examiner has to determine the amount of the penalty which is warranted and incorporate in his decision the violation of an order that the penalty be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.566" offset="11405626">The only time findings of fact were required under those regulations is after a hearing which is precisely the point we are making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.695" offset="11434152">Now, back to the statutory language itself, I think the reading that we proposed, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, certainly is within the meaning of the -- is reasonably within the wording so that the language can bear that meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.090" offset="11507713">Whether it is conclusive or not conclusive on the face of the statute, I think, is really beside the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.221" offset="11548255">As I recall, Judge Adams in the Third Circuit Opinion argued that the APA itself requires findings where there is a hearing and, therefore, that under the Secretary’s interpretation of the statutes Section 109 adds nothing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Randolph</label>
            <text syncTime="2883.000" offset="11635295">I have a couple of answers to that, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.473" offset="11645221">First of all, I think it is the wrong question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.132" offset="11655879">The question should have been -- when you look at the statute 109 (a) (3) notice that the APA is invoked right at the bottom, it is the last sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.602" offset="11693705">The question should have been why, after requiring findings of fact in a decision and a hearing, did Congress invoke the APA at the last part of the Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.427" offset="11732993">The answer to that if that question had been asked and, incidentally, it was not by the Court, the answer to that is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.801" offset="11758488">That Congress wanted to bring in to bear on the hearing all of the detailed requirements about what we mean by a Hearing Examiner, when the hearing has to be held, notice, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.434" offset="11809061">That would be swept in by a reference to the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.568" offset="11825571">He had to refer specifically to the APA to accomplish that for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.240" offset="11848245">First of all, and I do not think this was mentioned in our brief, Section 507 of the Act, this Act, the Coal Mine Act, specifically says that the APA is inapplicable, this entire Act, unless it is expressly so provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.564" offset="11921597">So, Congress had to invoke the APA for that reason, number one; and, number two, the APA would not have applied here in this case, otherwise, because of the trial de novo in the District Court which would make the APA inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.067" offset="11979589">I might add, the really remarkable thing about the statute is that the mine operators are even given an opportunity for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.104" offset="12011772">That is the remarkable thing about the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.432" offset="12021071">That cuts against the grain of jurisprudence because in trial de novo situations hearings are not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.410" offset="12052941">Now, getting back to the particular language, we think that this language is illuminated by the legislative history that bears on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.965" offset="12123158">This is not a detailed -- what I am about to tell the Court is not a detailed analysis of reports and a snippet of a hearing and maybe a line from another report and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.511" offset="12165372">This is, I think, probably the most solid legislative history that one can have because I rely on the House Provision and what that said and the Senate Bill and what that said, and what happen when they were put together in a merge in conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.025" offset="12239455">And, I think this will explain why that conjunction is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.591" offset="12253665">These two provisions, the House Bill and the Senate Bill, the predecessors of Section 109 (a) (3), are set out in our brief on Pages 24-25.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.807" offset="12306537">One thing is absolutely clear from both these Bills and that is that no findings of fact were required except in regard to a hearing, after a hearing was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.513" offset="12369336">The Senate Bill could hardly be more explicit on this point.</text>

            <label>Mr. Randolph</label>
            <text syncTime="3083.515" offset="12437359">Yes, the other brief did not go that high.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.423" offset="12465048">Now, the Senate Bill which is on Page 25 originally said that an order assessing a civil penalty shall be issued by the Secretary, etcetera, etcetera, only after the mine operator has been given an opportunity for a hearing and the Secretary has determined by decision incorporating findings of fact based on the record of such hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.937" offset="12567030">Now, that language is absolutely clear that the only time findings of fact were required was when there was a hearing, which is our point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.671" offset="12593989">The House Bill, I think, was just as clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.479" offset="12605274">He Conference Committee took both of those Bills, the House Bill and the Senate Bill, and what they did to that language that I have just quoted on Page 25 is, instead of saying “incorporating findings of fact based on the record of such hearing,” they took out based on the record of such “hearing” and added instead “therein.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.973" offset="12695239">There is not a word in the Conference Report that they were intending to change the meaning of this provision by doing that, by trying to streamline the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.762" offset="12730348">We do not think they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.767" offset="12738394">As a matter of fact, since the Senate and House Bills were in agreement on this point, and I think we mentioned this in the brief, Conference Committees are appointed to resolve differences between the houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.586" offset="12789698">They are to compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.392" offset="12796908">Here, there was no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.095" offset="12807670">The two Bills were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.689" offset="12814044">They were put together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.720" offset="12826165">The mine operators argue that something new came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.615" offset="12837763">If that were true, then the Conference Committee had exceeded its authority and a point of order would have been put on the floor and that would have defeated this entire legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.011" offset="12883425">We find that incredible to believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.082" offset="12891680">We think the legislative history is perfectly plain, and that is why the conjunction is in there, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because it is derived from this particular provision on Page 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.719" offset="12942253">Now, the mine operator’s only point really, and I do not think they stress this in their argument but since it is in the brief I will deal with it, for requiring findings of fact in cases where there is no hearing is simply this: If the mine operators had these findings of fact, they would be more upped to pay and that would relieve the Courts of some of the burden of enforcement suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.588" offset="13041727">Let me respond to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.957" offset="13051132">There are three points that I think are against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.948" offset="13063148">Number one, Congress never considered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.701" offset="13074119">Congress never considered whether the administrative burden entailed by that kind of a process as outweighed by the alleged benefits that the mine operator cites.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.609" offset="13121767">Number two, the underlying assumption that the mine operators will tend to pay more lacks any support whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.326" offset="13152591">There is no evidentiary support for that and if the idea is that the mine operators need more information because if they only knew what they were being charged with and why they were being penalized, they would pay, the fact is they could have gotten that information indeed, in many cases, did if not by talking to the Mine Inspector, calling up the Hearing Officer, seeking an informal conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.966" offset="13243184">They had that opportunity and yet, still, we have under these old regulations more than 18,000 violations that have not been paid yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.539" offset="13281532">The third point, and I think this is probably the most significant, is as to the burden on the Courts we think personally that the burden might well increase if you accept the mine operator’s arguments because what does it mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.376" offset="13344852">It means that the mine operators are then given one more opportunity to contest in a de novo enforcement action to argue that the whole action should be dismissed, not because they did not violate the Act, not because the penalty is too high, but because the findings of fact were not adequate, not sufficient under administrative law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.892" offset="13430847">Professor Davidson (ph), as an administrative law treaty, says at Section 1601 that the amount of litigation involved where the adequacy of administrative findings is nothing short of tremendous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.031" offset="13491452">If that is what this results in, if a holding for the mine operators results in that, it means that every enforcement action will be met at the outset with a contest over whether the findings effect were detailed enough or sufficient enough and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.336" offset="13552683">And that, I think Mr. Blackwell used the argument of Alice in Wonderland, that is Alice in Wonderland-like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.056" offset="13579536">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.868" offset="13582776">Because the only importance of those administrative proceedings is merely that they are charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.252" offset="13600330">They are simply acclaimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.959" offset="13607122">They wash out as soon as the enforcement action is brought, they are irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.988" offset="13711298">Indeed, there are more than enough administrative safeguards for the mine operators.</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.731" offset="13734286">A minute ago, you were saying it does not make any difference whether there are or not because the whole thing washes out when an enforcement action is brought.</text>

          <turn speaker="randolph" startTime="3414.581" stopTime="3572.472">
            <label>Mr. Randolph</label>
            <text syncTime="3414.581" offset="13761662">I said it does not make any difference whether the findings of fact were adequate enough, detailed enough, because the Court in an enforcement action cannot rely upon them anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.376" offset="13800846">They are irrelevant to whether the -- and the jury is the one that determines the facts, and Mr. Blackwell indeed requested a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.931" offset="13827073">So the jury is not going to consider whether the administrator’s findings of fact were sufficient or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.607" offset="13845776">They are just irrelevant to that consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.954" offset="13859151">Now, I think this is where the Third Circuit went wrong in the Delta Mining case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.993" offset="13883288">If you read the opinion by that Court, there is not a word in the entire opinion -- the words “de novo” do not appear within the entire opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.181" offset="13920069">I do not know whether the Court mistakenly thought that this was the kind of case where the administrative action is reviewed on the basis of sufficiency of the evidence, but I would point out that there are two things that I think this Court can see the error that the Court of Appeals fell into in the Delta Mining case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.626" offset="14029887">One of the main reasons on Page 11-A of our petition, I will read it to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.842" offset="14054652">The Court of Appeals in Delta Mining said “Judicial review of a final administrative determination is held as a right and such review is rendered practically impossible or at least vastly more difficult where the agency’s decision is not accompanied by expressed findings.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.420" offset="14117032">That goes precisely to the point that I was just discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.499" offset="14129362">It is not rendered more difficult because there is no review of the agency’s findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.635" offset="14145871">This is a de novo trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.973" offset="14151200">The agency’s findings are transformed merely into a charge that has to be proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.246" offset="14172307">So, I think that is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.542" offset="14181502">On Page 12-A, the Court said, finally, “Though it might not be beyond Congress’ power to provide for the entry by the Secretary of penalty assessments orders without findings of fact, such a provision would run against the grain of much of our administrative jurisprudence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.245" offset="14244301">I submit that it is just other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.438" offset="14257048">Requiring findings of fact when there has been no administrative hearing runs directly against the grain of our administrative jurisprudence because the APA which is a reflection of that tradition says specifically that, number one, hearings are not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.556" offset="14329564">Number two, findings of fact are not required when there is an opportunity for de novo review of all the issues in a District Court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.293" offset="14368539">That is precisely what this statute provides.</text>
