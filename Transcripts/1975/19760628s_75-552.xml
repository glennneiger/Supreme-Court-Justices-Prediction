            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="16.974" offset="141481">This case and the companion case presenting the same issue are here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.803" offset="176798">The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires environmental impact statements on the various circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.990" offset="213579">Federal agencies, whenever they make a recommendation or proposal upon major federal action that will significantly affect the environment, are required to file an impact system.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.332" offset="266973">The Sierra Club and other organizations brought this suit to force the Secretary of Interior and other federal officials to prepare an environmental impact statement on an entire area in the northern great plains.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.498" offset="335623">This was said to be necessary before committing private companies to mine any of the vast coal reserves controlled by the federal government in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.014" offset="381703">The District Court ruled in favor of the federal officials, but the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.435" offset="415349">The Court of Appeals also enjoined the Secretariat approval of several mining plans in one portion of the northern great plains area.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.524" offset="455682">We stayed that injunction when we granted these petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.524" offset="471669">We now vacate the injunction, reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.115" offset="502075">We agree with the District Court that there exists no proposal for a major federal action with respect to the northern great plains area as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.175" offset="546274">In absence of such a proposal, the Act by it's plain language does not require an environmental impact statement on an entire region.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.426" offset="591309">But federal officials may continue to prepare statements on individual leases or on groups of proposals that may have accumulative environmental effect upon geographically defined areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.284" offset="646794">Mr. Justice Marshall with whom Mr. Justice Brennan joined, has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
