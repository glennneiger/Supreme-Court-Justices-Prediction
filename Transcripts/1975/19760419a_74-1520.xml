            <label>Mr. Thomas A. Foran</label>
            <text syncTime="52.119" offset="208457">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.066" offset="224235">This case involves an alleged violation of the First Amendment right of political association of four public employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.495" offset="265927">They were process servers and Court attendants in the Office of the Sheriff of Cook County whom I argue in behalf of, incident to discharges or threat of discharge for political consideration or more commonly described the so called patronage practice of requesting political sponsorship for either appointment to certain public jobs or to continue in employment in public jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.758" offset="406988">In this particular case, the plaintiffs below, who are the respondents here, were employees of the Sheriff’s Office in December 1970 when an incumbent Republican was replaced by the Democrat Elrod who was elected the prior month.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.548" offset="494132">The plaintiffs were not in job categories like some others in the Sheriff’s Office which were protected by civil service or other nonpolitical or merit system of job category.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.838" offset="559334">They were not protected in anyway by contract or agreement or legislation against a summary discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.838" offset="595278">The plaintiffs stated in their case that they are Republicans in that they have originally obtained their jobs in the Sheriff’s Office by having Republican sponsorship by Republican officials in order to be employed by the Republican Sheriff.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="166.621" offset="666436">They stated that in their complaint?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_a_foran" startTime="168.123" stopTime="283.249">
            <label>Mr. Thomas A. Foran</label>
            <text syncTime="168.123" offset="672392">Yes sir, they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.441" offset="681691">They alleged that they were discharged because they were Republicans and could not or would not obtain democratic sponsorship to continue on their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.687" offset="730697">Now, in the complaint there are number of allegations concerning a practice of discharging non-civil service employees in Cook County by the Sheriff’s Office on the assumption that a sheriff of a different political party would discharge any employee who didn’t pledge allegiance to the party of the new sheriff, who didn’t agree to work for the party and candidates of the party of the new sheriff, would not contribute a portion of their wages to the party of the new sheriff or would not obtain political sponsorship by the new sheriff’s party.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.825" offset="903210">Now, neither the complaint nor the affidavits in this case allege that these four respondents were required or that they were even told that they might be required to meet any of the conditions that were set forth as a practice other than this political sponsorship condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.794" offset="991086">I might add that the respondents here have referred the Court to a stipulation of fact by the sheriff and the Sheriff’s Office in a companion case, the Shakman case, also out of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.488" offset="1053884">We do not object to that statement of facts of the operation of the Sheriff’s Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.987" offset="1079902">We feel that it does fairly state what the factual situation is in the Sheriff’s Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.342" offset="1109368">The District Court below denied the preliminary injunction and dismissed the case for failure to state a claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.249" offset="1132983">Can you tell from the Shakman case, Mr. Foran, whether a Republican might be employed in the tradition of the Sheriff’s Office by a Democratic Sheriff if he obtained a democratic sponsor?</text>

            <text syncTime="300.443" offset="1201737">Mr. Justice Rehnquist the stipulation of the Sheriff’s Office and I think I can describe it in summary very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.502" offset="1229949">There are 3,000 employees in the Sheriff’s Office in Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.528" offset="1246041">About 500 of them fit into a kind of large category that includes the types that you were mentioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.377" offset="1273417">About 500 of them are either supervisory, are un-sponsored by any political person or are holdovers from previous administrations almost in affect career employees, might well have been sponsored by a Republican.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.749" offset="1346978">About 1300 of the employees -- of the 3000 employees are protected by a legislatively created merit system.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.729" offset="1390864">This includes the sheriff’s police and the corrections officers who run the county jail and the house of corrections and the juvenile facility and about 1200 are in this -- of the 3000 are in this patronage area where they are appointed only if sponsored by a political figure in the party of the existing sheriff.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.861" offset="1503399">But now is it theoretically possible at least for a Republican employee within this 1200, when a Democratic sheriff comes to power, if he could get a sponsorship from a Democrat, he could be retained?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas A. Foran</label>
            <text syncTime="461.302" offset="1845185">That’s a hard question to answer, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.963" offset="1859814">I think for the purposes of this argument and for the purposes of this Court’s decision that the patronage practice of sponsorship would presume on the part of the sponsoring Democrat that this man was going to be worker generally for the Democratic Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.623" offset="1978410">In the lower court, the District Court, Judge Power dismissed the case on the basis of Alomar versus Dwyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.340" offset="2013309">While it was pending on appeal the Seventh Circuit came to down with the Illinois State Employees Union versus Lewis where a Republican Secretary of State had in effect done the same thing to a large number of Democrats after he took over as the Secretary at the State’s Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.474" offset="2093871">I did mention that Shakman case and I should say what the Shakman case had previously held.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.046" offset="2116127">The Shakman case was an independent who was running for constitutional delegate and in effect a kind of an nonpartisan election and in the Shakman case, he had argued that because the major political parties had a patronage system in the republic employment that he was, his voter candidate rights to equal protection in his election, his attempt to become a constitutional delegate had been interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.225" offset="2252800">So that it came up in a slightly different context than the Lewis case or this case or Alomar versus Dwyer, but nevertheless was related in the instance of the patronage system being in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.647" offset="2314553">So that the core issue in the case is really a very specific one.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.062" offset="2332212">Is there a First Amendment prohibition against an elected public official discharging a non-civil service employee for his failure to obtain political sponsorship by the party that the elected official wishes him to.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.042" offset="2416118">Perhaps in a different context are the respondents' rights to their jobs which are conditioned on their political affiliation, the equivalent of their right to free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.755" offset="2474945">Only the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.898" offset="2495530">The Second Circuit the said no, the Fourth Circuit of the said no D.C. Circuit has said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.965" offset="2523847">This Court has in recent years unequivocally held that the right of political association is not absolute and is subject to reasonable restriction or limitation in the public interest, in the Letter Carrier’s case, in the Buckley versus Valeo, this Court has so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.943" offset="2603677">This Court and I think in an important case to consider because it is the companion case to the case upon which the respondents rely, in Board of Regents versus Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.109" offset="2660415">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that non-tenured teacher who was fired without reason being given to him, did not have such a property interest in his job that it would generate due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.118" offset="2740454">Now, the Seventh Circuit had ruled that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.601" offset="2750380">The Seventh Circuit said that he was entitled to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.721" offset="2766785">This Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.529" offset="2774100">He was a non-tenured teacher and he had alleged that his First Amendment rights have been violated, but had been fired for no reason given.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.959" offset="2827807">Now -- so that this Court has ruled that he had no such property and interest which would justify protection under the Due Process Clause or under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.590" offset="2886322">The argument then must be by the respondents that this non-tenured, these non-tenured employees who had no contract, no agreement, who had got their job well-knowing since they had already receive their jobs politically sponsored, that it was the time of -- type of job that needed political sponsorship, whether those people had such a right in their job that their political association was like free speech and that their interest as individuals in free speech overrode any governmental interest that might exist in a partisan political public service, a governmental interest in that which could condition or restrict their right to political association.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.633" offset="3106482">It seems to me that while the respondents do here argue that there is no legitimate governmental interest in or at least no compelling governmental interest, in a partisan political public service that in that area which has not been articulated, we must strongly disagree with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.965" offset="3219853">Their position is based on this type of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.234" offset="3240856">Since some courts, including this Court, have agreed that non-partisanship in public service and public office is under some circumstances, some legislative acts, the Hatch Act is the most obvious, campaign financing, that if in certain areas of Government that it is good to have a nonpartisan tenured security-oriented employee that therefore necessarily political public service is bad.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.085" offset="12432300">I understand that question and my answer to it is three things, three-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.638" offset="12450482">Number one, this is a vastly different thing than a civil service system in which there is a presumption where that the office holder has to show a cause for firing and go through a whole panoply of due process rights and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.867" offset="12527386">The burden in these cases would be on the discharged employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.270" offset="12552986">The burden of proof would be on the discharged employee to show that the sole reason for his discharge was the exercise of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.636" offset="12586527">That the very placement of that burden on the employee in this kind of a situation in my judgment makes it clear that there would be very little problem in terms of enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.230" offset="12636891">Now, there is some history in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.563" offset="12650162">In the Seventh Circuit we have history based on two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.817" offset="12663223">Number one, we have the so-called Shakman consent decree, and number two, we have had the decision in Shakman and in the Lewis opinion for four or five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.015" offset="12703974">There have been a grand total of I believe four enforcement proceedings under the Shakman decree, in that entire period of time with many, many thousands of workers covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.596" offset="12746292">There have been I think five or six cases filed under the general provisions of Shakman and Lewis and in that whole period of time in the entire Seventh Circuit and I think in each instance, the only people who filed those suits in one instance was the Public Employees Union in Lewis, which resulted in the Lewis decision, another one is this case, which again is filed as a class action in the situation where the violation is admitted and flagrant on the record and no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.674" offset="12878681">And the others were three or four cases in which after Governor Walker became Governor, people in much higher levels brought actions, which in each instance resulted in the determination that they were policy-making employees and therefore not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.841" offset="12951301">I think that if you look at it in those terms you can see that any concern or any interim argument based on the idea that there would be a flood of litigation arising from this kind of a determination is simply not justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.220" offset="13012846">At the same time, I cannot answer your question without also saying that we are dealing here with the protection of fundamental First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.716" offset="13058821">There is no one else to protect these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.790" offset="13071151">There is no procedure in Illinois, administrative state law or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.908" offset="13091631">If the sheriff of Cook County or other officeholders throughout this country utilized the public payroll in their election to public office and the tax money that the tax payers provide them for the purpose of soliciting an army of partisan workers, while in doing so and in order to do so requiring those persons to forfeit their fundamental rights under the Constitution, it’s -- yes sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="3359.152" offset="13436552">But forgetting about looking at it from the legal standpoint and analyzing whether there could be a waiver of constitutional rights here, I don’t think that the, and you can phrase this in terms of the “live by the sword, die by the sword” analogy or any other kind of phrase that expresses that same idea.</text>
