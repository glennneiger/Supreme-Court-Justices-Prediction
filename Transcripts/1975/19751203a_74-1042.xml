            <text syncTime="17.481" offset="173274">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.389" offset="192918">The basic issue in these cases is whether Rule 10b-5 is to be turned into a National Negligence Statute, affecting all conduct in any way touching on the purchase or sale of a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.053" offset="255507">This issue is presented in the petition for certiorari as whether respondents may predicate a cause of action against petitioners for aiding and abetting a violation of Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 there under, an allegation and proof of negligence alone of whether they must be alleged and proved something more than negligence, some fraud, some knowledge of the fraud or some reckless or willful conduct tantamount to fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.628" offset="389881">There are three other issues in this case which are important to the petitioners and the respondents as a disposition of anyone of them can dispose of this litigation and they are whether.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.235" offset="444216">Ernst and Ernst as a matter of law ordered the first securities with all diligence whether the respondent’s conduct is such as to estop them from bringing their claims against Ernst and Ernst and whether the respondents can avoid the bar of the statute limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.543" offset="537525">These issues of course are best under understood in the context of the facts which briefly are that First Securities was a small broker dealer in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.505" offset="581306">It was owned by Leston B. Nay.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.234" offset="596248">The respondents for many years were regular securities customers of First Securities and as such in their regular securities transactions received all of the documentary paraphernalia that a securities customer ordinarily receives.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.020" offset="655390">They will receive purchase and sale forms, confirmation of sales, accountings, all the documents that emanate from a broker dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.044" offset="691543">Most or all of the respondents were also friends or had some personal or social relationship with Nay or with Mrs. Nay and as a result Nay was able to persuade the respondents to invest in what he called an escrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.715" offset="758208">He told them that he had befriended a small loan company that was required by law to maintain a cash escrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.507" offset="789346">Their investments would be perfectly safe and it paid 12% interest in some cases, 9% in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.825" offset="818603">Of course, the escrow was fictitious and there was no small loan company, but these people paid their funds to Nay by personal check made payable to him personally and he evidenced the investments, the escrow investments by personal notes of his or by -- by letters, all however the correspondence coming from on the letterhead of First Securities Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.573" offset="921630">None of the transactions involving this escrow ever were reflected on the books and the records of First Securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.656" offset="949946">The respondents conducted all of their transactions with respect to the escrow with Nay personally as compared with the transactions they had when dealing with First Securities as regular securities customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.394" offset="1004908">The petitioner, Ernst and Ernst was the auditor of First Securities from sometime in the middle 40s until 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.820" offset="1046599">The respondents’ relationship with First Securities as regular securities customers and as escrow investors began in the early 40s in some cases and continued up until 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.418" offset="1108980">In June of 1968, Nay’s fancy scheme caught up with them and he shot and killed himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="559.947" offset="2343109">The Ninth Circuit has adapted a standard which does not require the element of scienter although the case in which they adapted it, clearly had that element, but the majority of the Circuits, the Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth circuits at least, who have specifically addressed themselves to the question have required something more than negligence in terms of culpability for a liability in a private money damage action under Rule 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.148" offset="2455958">Those circuits are correct I believe, if the statute and the legislative history and the reasoning behind those as looked at deep as Mr. Justice Powell pointed out in his concurring opinion in Blue Chip when a language -- when a statute is being construed the place to start is the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.321" offset="2552611">10b-5 speaks of manipulative and deceptive devices.</text>

            <text syncTime="842.212" offset="3472121">We submit that requiring something more than negligence in terms of culpability would simply be a continuation of the direction that Rule 10b-5 and Section 10b has been taking and would prevent an abrupt change in direction which endorsement of the Seventh Circuit’s opinion would constitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.879" offset="3586851">With respect to Ernst and Ernst's conduct, even if a simple negligence standard were permitted for Rule 10b-5, it is clear we submit on the record that as a matter of law, Ernst and Ernst conducted its audit of First Securities with all due diligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.957" offset="5403197">Well, the record does not support he did not take vacations, but for the record is clear to contrary, but vacations, weak internal accounting controls and there are two other elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.525" offset="5445411">One was the fact that Nay borrowed from this company and the other was that there was tampering in net capital violation in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.345" offset="5480728">Both of those were litigated in part of this suit below that was directed against the Midwest Stock Exchange and both of those were found to be by the Seventh Circuit and the District Court as not instances of negligence and a part of the Midwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.440" offset="5557110">Now, Ernst and Ernst was simply to report those to the Midwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.744" offset="5574247">The gist of the complaint as I understand it is that Ernst and Ernst reported those informally rather than formally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.599" offset="5601728">I am not sure the legal distinction, but that appears to be what it is and those are not audit problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.194" offset="5636105">For instance, the excessive borrowings are called by Nay, they were always less than the earned surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.467" offset="5665153">Nay owned the company and the amounts he borrowed were always less than the earned surplus of the company, considerably less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.956" offset="5691171">They were all reported on the financial statements just as the requisite SEC instructions require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.656" offset="5733907">The respondents claim that the debt should have been reserved because they said Nay was hopelessly insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.875" offset="5758776">Well, they overlooked the fact that the debts were reserved, reserved to 100% under net capital computations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.543" offset="5789496">Debts from an officer or partner or director of a broker dealer must be carried as a zero asset in determining that capital and that was done in these instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.863" offset="5830769">So those are the other instances Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.986" offset="5851249">So we submit that a remand on the issue of recklessness or fraud would be particularly inappropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.222" offset="6644222">In 1968, a man calling himself Leston B. Nay, a member of the Midwest Stock Exchange and President of First Securities Company of Chicago murdered his wife and killed himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.608" offset="6721754">He left a suicide note in which he said that his company was bankrupt because of his debts committed over a period of 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.462" offset="6785179">His suicide note also said that a certain escrow in which he had sold investments to the customers of First Securities Company was spurious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.708" offset="6854142">Nay had persuaded these plaintiffs, long time customers of First Securities Company to let that company sell their standard securities and invest the proceeds in this fictitious escrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.342" offset="6932719">There was no escrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.943" offset="6943063">Nay converted their money to his own use immediately upon its receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.514" offset="6965424">Nay’s suicide note also asked that Ernst and Ernst be notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.444" offset="6993114">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.898" offset="6998861">What part did Ernst take it in Nay’s horrid story?</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.095" offset="7027700">For 20 years, Ernst had certified each year to Midwest Stock Exchange that First Securities Company, a balance sheet of First Securities Company showing it to be solvent when in fact it was utterly insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.833" offset="7106694">In each of those 30 years, Ernst had certified to Midwest Stock Exchange that it had revealed the internal accounting control of Nay’s company as it was required to do by the standards of its profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.845" offset="7190704">Actually, the company had no internal accounting control because they had Nay had adamant office rule that all mail received by the company, addressed to him or to the company for his attention could only be opened, seen or read by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.599" offset="7289760">When he was away for a few days, the mail by his command piled up unopened on his desk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.951" offset="7331138">Nay secreted the incoming mail on his debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.169" offset="7356007">A great mass of his correspondents with his escrow victims was found locked in his desk.</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.086" offset="13987661">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.108" offset="14003752">The basic position of the SEC in this case, assuming that the auditor's conduct below was not more than negligent, is that the judgment should be rendered for Ernst and Ernst and this is so on a very simple basis because the plaintiffs in this case, respondents here in their capacity as escrow investors were not reasonably foreseeable by Ernst and Ernst and as they concede, they did not rely on any order prepared by Ernst and Ernst.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.508" offset="14133319">We share with Ernst and Ernst then with the amicus, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, a reluctance to expose accounting firms to potential damages in vast amounts for negligence in cases where it strikes one's basic sense of fairness that such damages should not be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.479" offset="14221195">But Ernst and Ernst comes to this Court in this quite unusual case actually, quite an untypical case and asks that the baby be thrown out with the bath water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.144" offset="14263932">It asks this Court to enunciate a rule that if accepted, would also bar recovery in meritorious cases, the more typical cases; the cases were a sense of fairness would say to one that perhaps damage judgment should be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.802" offset="14334567">Now, if this Court wishes to develop such a broad rule, respecting the liability of auditors for negligence then we have offered in our brief in which I will speak to you briefly today, what we think is a sound approach in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.140" offset="14403843">But in developing such a broad rule in this case, this Court would then be called upon to strike an appropriate balance between two important competing policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.218" offset="14444177">On the one hand there is the necessity of maintaining high professional standards of accounts because of their extremely important role with respect to the Federal Securities Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.305" offset="14484510">This country system of such laws is dependent on the disclosure, the integrity of disclosures which are made to investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.809" offset="14518573">In order recognized as having a public duty in that respect to safeguard the interest of the public who reads their reports, more so than an interest to safeguard the auditor’s client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.457" offset="14577192">Auditors are called upon to certify financial statements containing the wide variety of documents required to be given to investors by public companies and to be filed with the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.225" offset="14616167">In many instances, the opinion of the auditing firm is essential before securities may be offered to the public or placed privately, Thus, the continued confidence of the public in the securities laws of this country has to rest to some great extent on the shoulders of the accounting profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.817" offset="14686593">Now, when I say this I do not mean to suggest that auditors are insurers of the honesty of their clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.123" offset="14707804">Certainly, they are not and they have no obligation affirmatively, but to seek out fraud, nor should they have any liability of any kind for honest professional judgments which turned out on hindsight to have been erroneous, but the auditor is, in a peculiarly advantageous position to detect and to stop fraud in its incipiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.473" offset="14801218">The question here is what if he fails to that through negligence and investors are injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.340" offset="14828699">Now, we doubt that this Court would wish to say that there never could be a case under any circumstances under 10b-5 where an injured investor might recover damages against an auditor whose professional conduct fell below the standards of his profession.</text>

            <text syncTime="3837.651" offset="15453966">Now, we think that in appropriate balance there must be struck between a sufficiently broad standard of culpability to reinforce this important right of investors to receive accurate information and the need to avoid unfairness to particular accountants by subjecting him for damages to negligence to persons who do not rely on his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.894" offset="15538916">Now, the question is how is this balance to be struck?</text>

            <text syncTime="3875.420" offset="15604954">First, in this case, we do agree with the respondents that negligent conduct is sufficient to establish a violation of Section 10 and Rule 10b-5, but it does not follow that every negligent violation should give rise to a money damages remedy, thus we separate ours into two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.619" offset="15685829">The first, is there a violation of the Section and second, what should the remedy be?</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.064" offset="15707563">I agree with Mr. Berner, Ernst and Ernst counsel that the legislative history on 10b is far from conclusive, but I offered to this Court that there is nothing in the phrase “any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance” which limits conduct only to that which is done intentionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.730" offset="15806201">Indeed, when Congress wanted to limit the Act to willful conduct, both with respect to violations and with respect to civil liability for this violation, it specifically said so.</text>

            <text syncTime="4478.249" offset="18016265">With respect to the question that has attracted some attention as to what is alleged in the complaint, what the theories are and what the facts are, I would point to the third defense of Ernst and Ernst in its answer filed in this case which says, it is in page 24 of the appendix, in which statements made that Ernst and Ernst had no knowledge of any conduct of Nay alleged to be fraudulent in the second count, without such knowledge, Ernst and Ernst could not aid or abet Nay’s alleged fraudulent conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.913" offset="18150952">I believe this should answer questions as to whether the possibility of proving or the issue as to recklessness or fraud was ever raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.300" offset="18196510">It was raised in the answer to the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="4527.885" offset="18214900">You mean to say that aid or abet without any knowledge would be quite different from the use of those terms as words of originally field of criminal law, would it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="4542.035" offset="18271429">My point is that when we -- by this defense we raise the issue as to the level of culpability and this defense tends to set up fairly clearly that the petitioner who was defendant below would take the position that without some knowledge, some scienter, there could be no recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.058" offset="18379576">This is in response to the discussion as to whether the respondents should be permitted to return the District Court and not amend their complaint as I understand it, but simply to make a new argument which we think is unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.423" offset="18453032">I would like also to point out that the record establishes very clearly that Ernst and Ernst in fact did review the system of internal accounting controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="4599.023" offset="18499426">And with respect to the mail rule, it has never been shown in this case and there is no evidence which supports a causable connection, this issue was not included in the petition for certiorari, but was argued below and to explain the immateriality of a mail rule, if Nay had said to these people, please addressed your mail to me to lock box 1 or First Securities Company lock box 1 that he opened himself, they would have done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.514" offset="18653339">And to think that to require an accountant to review all of the incoming mail of all of the officers and directors of a brokerage house in the circumstances as to think that is -- that itself is a derogation of joint (Inaudible) fraud, we submit is absurd and finally, I would say --</text>

            <text syncTime="4661.479" offset="18749261">As part of the alleged fraudulent conduct in the scheme on the part of Nay was that he used for securities, he used the stationery and he used the office and the communications were sent to him at First Securities and if had told the plaintiffs when you communicate with me about this escrow business you have to do it through lock box 1, that would -- might well have raised their suspicion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4690.402" offset="18864931">That is as alleged, but it also is reasonable to assume that he specifically told these people to address all mail to him in connection with the escrow to his attention or to him personally because as the record indicates he told them he did not want anyone at First Securities to know about these investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.796" offset="18942462">He did not want -- this was a company whose name he never revealed and it should remain confidential.</text>
