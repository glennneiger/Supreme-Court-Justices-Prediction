            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73667">I have the judgment to announce in 74-1409, North against Russell and for reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk this morning and the judgments of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.739" offset="136570">Mr. Justice Brennan concurred in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.291" offset="154751">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.265" offset="170634">Mr. Justice Stewart join by Mr. Justice Marshall filed a dissenting opinion.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="30.390" offset="195189">As the Chief Justice has just indicated I have filed a  dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.804" offset="228834">In this case, a man named Lonnie North was held into a Kentucky Criminal court and there he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment by Judge C. B. Russell.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.573" offset="295917">Judge Russell is a coal miner without any legal training or education whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.779" offset="324756">Mr. Justice Marshall and I believe that a trial before such a judge that results in the imprisonment of the defendant is constitutionally intolerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.611" offset="372090">It deprives the accused of his right to the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, and deprives him as well of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.780" offset="428723">Beginning with the capital case of Powell against Alabama, extending through the felony case of Gideon against Wainwright and culminating in the misdemeanor case of Argersinger against Hamlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.827" offset="480968">The Court's decisions have firmly established that a person who has not been accorded the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel cannot be sentenced to even one day of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.856" offset="533004">But the essential presupposition of this basic constitutional right is that the judge conducting the trial will be able to understand what the defendant's lawyer is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.769" offset="588697">For if the judge himself is ignorant of the law, then a lawyer for the defendant will be able to do little or nothing to prevent an unjust conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.866" offset="629030">In a trial before such a judge, the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel thus becomes a hollow mockery.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.526" offset="667691">In this case Judge Russell denied a motion for trial by jury, although under Kentucky law North was clearly entitled to a jury trial upon request.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.049" offset="713771">And after finding North guilty, Judge Russell proceeded to impose a sentence of imprisonment, although such a sentence was clearly unauthorized by Kentucky law.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.667" offset="760269">But even if it were not possible to demonstrate in a particular case that the lay judge had been incompetent or the trial egregiously unfair, I think that any trial before a wholly untrained lay judge that results in the defendant's imprisonment violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.674" offset="852325">The Court seems to say that these constitutional deficiencies can all be swept under the rug and forgotten because the convicted defendant may have a trial De novo before a qualified judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.578" offset="907914">Mr. Justice Marshall and I cannot agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.498" offset="923587">In the case of Ward against Village of Monroeville, the Court made clear that “the State's trial court procedure cannot be deemed constitutionally acceptable, simply because the State eventually offers a defendant an impartial adjudication. Petitioner is entitled to a neutral and detached judge in the first instance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="236.174" offset="1018359">The Court today would distinguish the Ward case as directed at the need for independent, neutral, and detached judgment, not at legal training.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.915" offset="1061305">But surely there can be no meaningful constitutional difference between a trial that is fundamentally unfair because of the judge's possible bias, and a trial that is fundamentally unfair because of the judge's ignorance of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.934" offset="1133403">At Runnymede in 1215 King John pledged to his barons that he would not make any Justiciaries, Constables, Sheriffs, or Bailiffs, but from those who understand the law of the realm.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.391" offset="1203202">Today, more than 750 years later, the Court leaves that promise unkept.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.287" offset="1234758">Mr. Justice Marshall and I respectfully dissent.</text>
