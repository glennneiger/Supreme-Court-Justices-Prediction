            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103354">We will hear arguments first this morning in Hancock, the Attorney General of Kentucky against Train the administrator of EPA.</text>

            <label>Mr. David D. Beals</label>
            <text syncTime="16.598" offset="169705">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.430" offset="180990">This case arises on a writ of certiorari to the Sixth Circuit to review that court's interpretation of the Cleaner Act Amendments of 1970 as that Act concerns the relations of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the operator and the respondent operators of existing Federal Air Contaminants Sources located in the Commonwealth Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.506" offset="269284">With the passage of the Cleaner Act in 1970, the Congress set forth the clearly define and discernible plan for the enhancement and enforcement and protection of the air resources of the United States. Basic to this plan were minimum standards to be prescribed by the EPA administrator under Section 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.955" offset="363116">The Congress stated the means by which these standards would be put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.593" offset="389656">In Section 107, directing that the states would have implementation plans to achieve and maintain the national primary and secondary Ambient Air Quality Standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.476" offset="441170">That these plans were state plans, is entirely consistent with the rest of the scheme of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.769" offset="474397">In 101(a), one of the findings of the Congress with respect to air pollution was that it was the primary responsibility of the State to control and abate air pollution at its source.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.828" offset="526642">Indeed, Section 101(b) listed as one of the purposes of the Act to assist the states and local governments in the formulation and execution of their air pollution programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.777" offset="586410">As to what these programs should at a minimum contain, Congress was also very explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.657" offset="609921">In Section 110, they listed a number of requisites which had to be included in any one county implementation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.718" offset="650149">Among these the basic requirement of the plans was that the plan provide for the attainment of the primary standards as expeditiously as possible and in no case, more than three years following approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.708" offset="726113">Also required in 110 were provisions for emission limitations, schedules, timetables for compliance and such other measures as might be deemed necessary to meet these standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.215" offset="772193">But in addition to these emission standards, 110 also specified that the states had to incorporate into their plan, appropriate devices, methods and systems for monitoring, compiling and analyzing data and making this data available to the administrator, appropriate procedures and systems for reviewing the location and new sources, appropriate procedures to ensure that no emission in one air quality region would cause or interfere with the attainment of the standards and in the other air quality region.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.372" offset="920778">It also called for adequate personnel spending and authority on behalf of the state to carry out the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.783" offset="954423">It required that the plan have authority to require the installation and monitoring equipment to require periodic reports from air contaminant sources, to correlate this data received from these reports to the emission standards that were currently existing and required authorization to restrain any air pollutant source which was presenting an eminent and substantial danger to health.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.591" offset="1097679">The contention of the common law of the Kentucky that these requirements, all of the requirements listed in 110, all the requirements which are contained in the states implementation plan are requirements respecting the control and abatement of air pollution.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.856" offset="1694734">But it would hardly relate to any sort of preventive concept, since the time for prevention is before the attainment dates.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="2485.781" offset="10046394">The original Bill that was passed by the House directed that Federal facilities would have comply with local emissions standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.507" offset="10085369">And the House Committee report on the Bill said the same thing that would direct the Federal facilities to comply with local emission standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.939" offset="10119014">Now, if that is all that you had, there could be not much question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.271" offset="10132389">We think that clients with local emission standards means that and does not mean complying with permit standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.338" offset="10160706">The Senate Bill use different language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.523" offset="10169378">It said it should comply with the requirements in this Act in the same manner as any other person should comply but the significant thing to us is that the Senate Committee in reporting this Bill saw no difference apparently between the word 'requirements' in this Bill and a emission standards in the House Bill because it said that the purpose of this section using the words “requirements” was to acquire Federal facilities to meet the emissions standards necessary to achieve ambient air quality standards as well as those established in other sections of Title 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.263" offset="10316396">Now, when the conference committee came along and adapted the language now in the Bill to comply with their requirements to the same extent as every other person what it said is that the language it was using required that the government comply with requirements respecting control of air pollution that it said, this House Bill and the Senate Amendment declared that the Federal departments and agencies should comply with applicable standards of air quality and emission standards, standards of air quality and emission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.559" offset="10453486">Now if the conference committee believed that in using the word of the Senate Bill “requirements” rather than using the word “emission standards” of the House Bill that it would somehow changing the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.552" offset="10513463">It seems to us, most extraordinarily that it did not indicate that to the contrary what it indicated is that it view the same the two phrases as meeting the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.412" offset="10556931">And this is I think particularly brought out by the fact that the very next sentence in the conference report points out that in one respect, it was changing the bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.815" offset="10598518">What it said was the conference substitute modifies the house provision to require that the President rather than the administrator of EPA be responsible for assuring compliance by Federal Agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.916" offset="10654943">Now, it pointed out the change it was making and saying that it was to be the president rather than the administrator of EPA who is responsible for ensuring Federal compliance by Federal agencies but yet it treated the word emission standards and requirements in the two versions of the legislations as meaning the same thing and the same thing it said it meant was standards of air quality and emission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.019" offset="10759328">Moreover, it seems to us would be most extraordinary we think, that after the conference committee said that it was giving the president, responsibility for ensuring compliance with the standards of air quality emissions that it then would have turned around and expected that the president would have to comply with state permit provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.095" offset="10847726">Now we have set out at length in our brief a number of respects in which we think the word “requirements” in the statute reflects a congressional intention to cover only the substantive standards and not the procedural ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.869" offset="10910734">Many of them are rather detailed in technical and not particularly appropriate for oral presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.776" offset="10934453">But let me just refer to one particular provision, which I think dramatizes it very clearly that is in Section 110(E) 1(a) and it provides that after the state has approved the plan for compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.432" offset="10997042">If a particular emission source is unable to achieve compliance with the deadlines because of technological problems that period for compliance may be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.850" offset="11042704">Now, there the requirements with which they can extend the time for compliance because of technological problems, obviously refers to the substantive standards the problems that because of the lack of technology, they are not able to control particular emissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.354" offset="11112712">It cannot refer in any meaningful sense of the term to any technological problems with respect to seeking a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.936" offset="11139044">And if what Congress was attempting to do in that provision was to reach the permit thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.999" offset="11159315">It seemed to me, it would not have put it in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.130" offset="11171854">Now we have a final point which this Court relied on in its Train opinion last year which is that the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who is the person charged with enforcing this statute has interpreted it as not applying to Federal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.255" offset="11252311">He did it in a 1972 Ruling and a 1973 Ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.847" offset="11270701">I should mention that the 1972 Ruling which is embodied in a letter from the regional administrator of EPA in the region involved here at page 57 of the Appendix points out the importance of the Federal instrumentalities submitting their compliance schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.972" offset="11355233">It is not just the substantive standards the Federal Instrumentalities are to meet the state compliance standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="2854.889" offset="11522835">There has been a great deal of discussion here by the Commonwealth as to the importance of the desirability of requiring the Federal instrumentalities to obtain permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.482" offset="11565258">If this is the most effective way, in which one can assure compliance, that it seems to us is a matter for the Congress to consider because we think that the statute as it is written, its language, its structure, its legislative history rather clearly indicates that Congress did not intend to subject the Federal facilities to state permit requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.901" offset="11670897">If that is to be changed, we think it is for Congress to change it and rather significantly there is now pending before the Congress a rather lengthy bill which would revise the Clean Air Act in many, many particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.251" offset="11724291">And one provision of that Bill would provide that from now on if this bill is passed Federal facilities would be required to obtain permits from states if the state so required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.892" offset="11774864">That we think is the way in which if Federal facilities are to obtain permits that Congress should make its intention clear and explicit.</text>
