            <text syncTime="40.468" offset="265220">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.120" offset="291760">On April 28th, 1972, the petitioner Ralph Nader, arrived at National Airport to take an Allegheny Airlines flight to Hartford, Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.127" offset="331780">When he arrived at the boarding gate and plenty of time of the flight, he had a confirmed reservation and had a proper ticket for the flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.072" offset="359574">But the agent told him that the plane was already full and he was not going to be able to get on.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.980" offset="383189">Allegheny had overbooked this flight and it had oversold it and in the parlance of the airline Industry, Mr. Nader had been bumped.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.978" offset="415267">Just like 900 other people had been bumped that very month by Allegheny Airlines and 16,000 other people had been bumped during a period of 3-and-half years.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.240" offset="568240">But I suspect that there were a no-show program penalty,your client would like that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Reuben B. Robertson, III</label>
            <text syncTime="121.433" offset="589034">Well, one of the problem with the no-show plan, that was tried and they have never been able to work this out, is that apparently a lot of the no-shows really are not the fault of the passenger and there is apparently a minority of individual passengers who simply neglect to cancel their reservation or do not show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.222" offset="664162">A lot of the no-shows are caused by mis-connecting flights for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.154" offset="683910">Traffic jams and this is particularly so with the security apparatus at the airport now, people get hung up trying to get to the plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.781" offset="714421">So, there are lots of mitigating factors that have made the no-show penalty concept a difficult one to work out for the Industry.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="161.218" stopTime="162.976">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="161.218" offset="748172">It is enough to spoil your case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="reuben_b_robertson_iii" startTime="162.976" stopTime="334.366">
            <label>Mr. Reuben B. Robertson, III</label>
            <text syncTime="162.976" offset="755172">I do not think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.626" offset="765830">The problem here is not that there was overbooking but that when Allegheny told Mr. Nader that he had a confirmed reservation, it did not give him the most important piece of information of all which was that there was a significant risk that he might be bumped from the flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.435" offset="833017">And if he had known that in advance, he could have protected himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.877" offset="846810">He could have arrived earlier to the airport than he did to improve his chances of getting on the plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.750" offset="870320">He could have taken an earlier flight or could even have taken a train to Hartford.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.121" offset="887770">So it is not the fact that the Airlines overbooked that is involved here but the fact that Allegheny conceals this practice and the fact that -- and conceals the fact that bumping results from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.591" offset="929670">When a passenger finds out, it is simply too late for them to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.917" offset="942941">And when Mr. Nader found out about this, there was no way he could get to Hartford in time for his commitment, speaking engagement without the window and his host Hartford were embarrassed and discredited in their fund-raising efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.192" offset="1000096">The thousands of people who were coming out to hear him during the lunch hour went away with disappointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.365" offset="1024756">As a result, the petitioner filed a suit for damages against Allegheny and two claims were pressed in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.006" offset="1051296">First, there was a statutory claim under the Aviation Act, alleging discrimination in not honoring his reservation priority, and secondly, and this is a claim that is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.061" offset="1103541">There was a tort claim of fraudulent misrepresentation arising under the Common Law of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.529" offset="1137396">And after a trial on the merits, the District Court found in petitioner's favor on both of these he wanted compensatory and punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.785" offset="1182431">On Appeal, the D.C. Circuit issued a lengthy opinion which it reversed and remanded the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.707" offset="1214092">The only issue of that decision that had issue here involves its holding on the misrepresentation claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.360" offset="1240736">As to which the Appellate Court divided 2:1.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.248" offset="1256305">The majority held that the Common Law misrepresentation claim should have been referred for an initial determination by the Civil Aeronautics Board and it held that regardless of the language in the Federal Aviation Act, that preserves Common Law remedies the CAB must be given an opportunity to approve conduct by an airline that otherwise would be a tortuous misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.637" offset="1349824">And if it does so the majority held, any Common Law right of action to recover damages for an injury that is caused by that conduct would be extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.159" offset="1387963">And Judge Fay dissented on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.688" offset="1398098">He said that this result that was not called for by the Aviation Act and in fact was contrary to that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.838" offset="1422653">And that is the issue before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.819" offset="5886562">Now, we have to start with overbooking itself even though it is not directly involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.256" offset="5912371">In the first place, petitioner concedes that overbooking itself is not illegal per se and in the second place the overbooking part of the case if you will has been remanded back and it is not before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.189" offset="5964093">But the reason that we have to start with overbooking, the reason that it is relevant is that if petitioner is successful here, there will be an end to overbooking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.001" offset="6011323">He has a letter in the record indicating that is really what he is trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.569" offset="6029608">He is not trying to get damages or fraud -- misrepresentation, he is using that as a vehicle to stop overbooking and the CAB has said in fact that if notice is published, overbooking will stop.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.535" offset="7845432">Well, I respectfully disagree Your Honor because I think that what he is saying is that the -- when he called to make a reservation, they failed to give him notice that he might not get on the flight because of an overbooking situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.136" offset="7907812">Now the problem, you got to understand this overbooking, this is not designed to create over sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.810" offset="7926516">If the thing works perfectly, there is no over sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.062" offset="7939577">For example, just take this very flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.376" offset="7948772">This very flight had a history of leaving with 6, an average of 6 empty seats on every flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.754" offset="7974372">So what they were doing and was overbooking in attempt to compensate for those empty seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.721" offset="7998196">They only had one prior instance of overbooking on this particular flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.909" offset="8014914">So it does not, it -- you should not the impression that this thing is just a sloppy method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.203" offset="8036126">It is done through a computer in an attempt to make every flight leave with every seat taken, and that is why the CAB very concerned about over sales said in effect that over -- we are going to improve in overbooking so long as you have three conditions and they are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.028" offset="8115434">First of all, you have to get denied boarding compensation, has to be handed to the man if there is an over sale right on the spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.648" offset="8141869">Secondly, you have to have priority rules so that you are fair to the over if over sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.508" offset="8161305">If you have more than one that they are treated in a proper manner and finally, that you have to file with us quarterly and monthly detailed reports with the CAB of your over sales, they get monthly reports about this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.048" offset="8855535">Because you are going to have people making multiple reservations and a lot of people not showing up and instead of 6 empty seats on Allegheny Flight 864, you are going to have 15 or 30 seats if you start telling the public this.</text>
