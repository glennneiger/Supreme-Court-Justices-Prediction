            <label>Mr. Jeremy V. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="53.664" offset="317993">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.871" offset="338787">The issues in this case while significant, will not I am afraid, be stimulating to the Court as the issues case argued just prior this or in the case argued yesterday, but I will do my best.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.957" offset="415169">The company is a manufacturer in Buffalo, New York and in 1974, the Steel Workers Union was certified by the National Labor Relations Board as the exclusive bargaining agent for the company’s office employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.109" offset="507747">At the same time, the Union was also the exclusive bargaining agent for the company’s factory workers and had been for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.176" offset="559991">The factory workers have been covered by collective bargaining contracts between the steel workers and the company going back into the late 1940s and early 1950s.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.628" offset="609833">Those contracts, among other terms and conditions, contained broad No Strike Clauses, two in fact, a very broad definition of what matters to be resolved through the grievance and arbitration procedure and at the time of the instant dispute, contained provisions allowing both Union and the employer to use the grievance procedure to resolve items of policy or general contract interpretation issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.450" offset="741072">In the latter part of 1974, the Steel Workers in the midst of bargaining the first contract for the office and technical workers set up picket lines around the company’s premises in the Buffalo, New York area and conducted a strike against the Buffalo Forge Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.884" offset="822888">The office workers and the factory workers worked in the same buildings with the offices generally being in the front and the factory area being in the back, but used common entrances.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.864" offset="874819">The pickets were set up at these entrances and at all other places surrounding the company’s premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.414" offset="912958">Four days later, that is four days after the picketing was established the respondent Steel Workers directed the local union officers of the factory local unions to honor the office-worker picket lines which the steel workers had established and to instruct the employees who were members of the factory workers local unions and members of the steel workers to also respect those office-worker picket lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.848" offset="1078679">That afternoon, the company having heard of a work stoppage plan, fired of a telegram to the steel workers, protesting that the rumored work stoppage will be a violation of the No Strike Clause, contained in the factory worker contract and offered to immediately arbitrate or go to arbitration over any issue which had caused this potential work stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.954" offset="1211172">That telegram was ignored and the work stoppage commenced the very next morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.655" offset="1253908">The company attempted to obtain injunctive relief under the theory of Boys Markets from the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.298" offset="1288494">Its application for temporary restraining order and the preliminary injunction were denied, essentially on the theory of the Fifth Circuit’s decision in the Amstar case interpreting this Court’s decision in Boys Market as having no application to any breach of contract strike, save the one situation where the strike is triggered by an ongoing or live grievance between the union and employer party to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.059" offset="1439587">An appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals resulted in affirmance of the District Court’s decision on essentially the same grounds that I have just summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.468" offset="1493190">The strike, even if it were a breach of contract, had to be literally over or triggered by some ongoing live grievance between the contracting parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.719" offset="1566228">It is our position generally, stated at the outset, that the requested relief falls squarely in the pathway of this Court’s decisions in Boys Markets, in Gateway Coal, as well as those decisions while they involved damage actions, also indicate the Court’s intention and purpose of finding ways to meaningfully enforce both the No Strike Clause as well as the Arbitration Clause in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.635" offset="1709902">This is not as a matter of premise, this is not the first time this Court has considered a sympathy strike situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.901" offset="1758907">The case is build as one which is the first sympathy strike case to appear before this Court, but it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.857" offset="1794747">One week after this Court’s decision in Sinclair, majority reversed the Court of Appeals in Yellow Transit Systems versus Teamsters, a case very simply which involved a union and an employer of an ongoing collective bargaining relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.608" offset="1885758">The union advised the employers in that case that it was going the set about organizing the Company’s office workforce.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.939" offset="1935077">It is it in the reply brief as also mentioned in the respondent’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.659" offset="2001951">Yellow Transit Systems is mentioned on page 2 or page 3, excuse me of the reply brief and on several pages of the respondent’s brief, in particular page 9 of respondent’s brief.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="497.278" offset="2092439">It is Teamsters against Yellow Transit Systems that is the reason I could not find it?</text>

            <text syncTime="500.030" offset="2103410">I am sorry, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.726" offset="2118248">The significance of that old case since the Court will recall that the reversal was a one word that majority opinion citing the Court’s decision in Sinclair was in our view the concurring opinion, the special concurring opinion written by Justice Brennan and in which the other dissenters in Sinclair joined, in which the concurring Justices said that the only reason they were concurring in the result was because there was no agreement between the parties to arbitrate any dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.009" offset="2295358">There was no clause in the contract providing for any internal arbitration over any dispute between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.197" offset="2344155">So this is not the first sympathy strike case that has come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.604" offset="2361709">As you might suspect, Your Honors, we have put it in a formula, that is if Teamsters versus Yellow Transit is to Sinclair as Monongahela, the Fourth Circuit case is to Boys Market than the extension, I would say extension, it is just the redundancy, that is our position in Buffalo Forge claiming that we were entitled to an injunction, has the same relationship to Boys Market as Monongahela as to Boys Market and as we think the concurring opinion in Teamsters versus Yellow Transit has to the original Sinclair decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.580" offset="2589601">The respondents claim that only the narrow holding of this Court’s decision in Boys Markets applies and that is continuation of the requirement that the strike must be literally over a live grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.439" offset="2693046">Its position in our view is essentially that Norris-LaGuardia is more than alive and well.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.652" offset="2713944">It is the dominant theme of federal regulation of labor management relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.883" offset="2742888">We could not disagree more and we think that the decisions of this Court establish that Norris-LaGuardia does not invariably bar injunctive relief, for example, the unlawful strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.574" offset="2821569">Legislative history referred to in our petition for certiorari and in our main brief indicate that it was not the intention of the Congress to bar injunctions against unlawful strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.906" offset="2882904">Is this strike in the Buffalo Forge case unlawful?</text>
            <text syncTime="699.074" offset="2899622">It is our contention that by resorting to strike, given the contract terms, that by resorting to strike without first arbitrating the disputed right of the union to engage in conduct prohibited by the contract that it violated its duty to arbitrate which it had freely given in the contract, violated its duty to arbitrate without irrigating to itself the interpretation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, especially in this case because a dispute arose the day before the work stoppage when the union directed its local unions to respect the picket lines and the company disputed the union’s right to issue such an instruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.669" offset="3133993">It would not have been as I understand, whether the contract prohibited the strike, but whether assuming the contract prohibited the strike, the strike could go forward?</text>

            <text syncTime="770.081" offset="3183626">The issue would have been, Mr. Justice Stevens, that the Union’s directive, the Steel Workers’ directives to their local union officials and members to honor the office-workers picket lines was a violation of the No Strike Clause of that contract and that the arbitrator was empowered to determine the union’s disagreement with the company’s position, that is whether the strike, the orders and the ensuing work stoppage were in fact a violation of the no strike pledges in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.148" offset="8231946">In any event, in Boys Markets, the employer contracted out certain work which the union maintained constituted a breach of the Collective Bargaining Agreement because it was work which the union claimed under the contract belonged to employees in the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.045" offset="8303521">The Union did not file a grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.228" offset="8312194">Union did not file the grievance arbitration machinery and instead went out on strike in support of its position that that work had to be reassigned to the employees in the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.610" offset="8365797">In the face of that strike, the employer sought an injunction and this Court was confronted with the possible dilemma of on the one hand a Norris-LaGuardia seemingly absolute ban on enjoining any strikes and on the other hand the pro-arbitration policy as set forth in Section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Amendments and this Court concluded that it was possible to accommodate those two competing and conflicting policies by writing a very narrow and limited intrusion upon the Norris-LaGuardia ban and that intrusion was predicated on the assumption that it was necessary to have an injunction where the vindication of the arbitration policy was at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.596" offset="8573732">More particularly, for example in Boys Market what this meant was essentially that if the Union had succeeded in bringing to bear enough economic pressure on the employer, so that the employer would capitulate and given to the union’s demands by reassigning the work, the consequence of that action by the union would have been to undermine the entire arbitration process said this Court in Boys Market because in essence it would have taken away the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and transferred it into the industrial warfare that the whole policy and procedure of Section 301 was designed to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.904" offset="8742901">So said this Court, we will in order to vindicate Section 301, set forth certain various specific requirements and those requirements of course petitioner has referred to as being literal requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.741" offset="8806326">We submit they are both literal and they also capture the very underlying purpose and intent of Boys Market, namely that although there is no general federal anti-strike policy, and therefore, Norris-LaGuardia should prevail said this Court in Boys Market even where there is a breach of a private contract unless it can be shown that some additional compelling public consideration is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.953" offset="8927116">Now, that additional compelling public consideration was present said this Court in Boys Markets because the strike was designed to undermine and indeed was undermining arbitration and the Court determined it would vindicate arbitration by doing two things: One, compelling the parties to in effect go back to arbitration and two, enjoining the strike at that time.</text>
