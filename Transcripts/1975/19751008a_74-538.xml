            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="38.969" offset="259155">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.175" offset="272008">This case is here on writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, reversing respondent's conviction on the grounds that the stolen credit cards he was convicted of possessing, have been obtained by postal inspectors during an illegal search of respondent’s automobile and should have been suppressed as evidence at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.595" offset="357689">I will state the case at some length not because the facts are particularly complicated, but because they demonstrate so convincingly that the decision of the Court of Appeals was erroneous and should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.147" offset="407949">On August 17, 1972, Postal Inspector Frank Barbarick (ph) received the telephone call from Awad Khoury, an informant who had supplied accurate information to Barbarick on a number of prior occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.357" offset="464687">The informant told Barbarick that respondent Watson was in possession of a stole Bank of America Credit Card and planned to turn the card over to Khoury.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.074" offset="507632">Later that day, Khoury met with Barbarick and turned over the credit card such as he had described.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.720" offset="534172">The inspector ascertained from the Bank of America that the credit card had been mailed three days earlier and had never reached its intended customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.378" offset="568863">The informant told Barbarick that he and respondent had an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.237" offset="584223">Respondent would furnish the informant with additional credit cards stolen from the mail and the informant would purchase airline tickets and merchandise with the cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.223" offset="624243">Inspector Barbarick instructed the informant to set up another meeting with the respondent to obtain the additional credit cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.478" offset="653186">Although there was sufficient time to have obtained a warrant for respondent’s arrest during the time that passed between this initial contact and the actual arrest, the postal inspector made no attempt to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.640" offset="709820">After several postponements, the meeting was finally held between the informant and respondent at noon on the 23rd of August, in a restaurant in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.174" offset="756004">At the designated time, the informant met and at a nearby table there were two postal inspectors stationed.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.067" offset="791531">Inspector Barbarick had instructed the informant that if respondent were in possession of stolen credit cards, the informant should light a cigarette as a signal to the surveillance agents in the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.613" offset="833745">The agents would then activate a beeper which would inform agents positioned outside the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.879" offset="862793">At the meeting, the informant learned that respondent had the credit cards outside in his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.226" offset="884213">He lit a cigarette and the agents in turn activated their signal, Inspector Barbarick and other agents entered the restaurant and placed respondent under arrest for possession of stolen mail and specifically for possession of the card that the informant had turned over to Inspector Barbarick six days earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.289" offset="960491">The inspectors escorted respondent out of the crowded restaurant and searched him.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.755" offset="982329">But they did not find the credit cards on this person.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.867" offset="994763">Respondent was then given Miranda Warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.386" offset="1008870">The respondent who had previously been an informant for Inspector Barbarick and who knew him well said in response to the Miranda Warnings, Frank, which was Barbarick’s first name, I understand my rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.171" offset="1055994">The inspector then asked respondent where his automobile was located and respondent pointed to a car nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.799" offset="1086505">And the inspector said, can I look inside and respondent said, go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.384" offset="1108866">Then the inspector said you know if I find anything it is going to go against you and respondent said, go ahead, there is nothing in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.932" offset="1143034">The respondent then gave the inspector the keys which opened the locked car and Inspector Barbarick and another inspector searched the car and found under the floor mat an envelope containing two pieces of stolen mail each with credit cards inside them.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.365" offset="1224745">These two pieces of mail together with these two credit cards, together with the credit card supplied six days or earlier by the informant formed the basis of the indictment returned against respondent for possession stolen mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.524" offset="1281379">Prior to trial, respondent moved to suppress the stolen credit cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.383" offset="1296843">He made several arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.904" offset="1302904">First that the informant was not a reliable informant, and therefore, there was no probable cause to arrest respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.485" offset="1329235">Second, that a warrant was required for respondent’s arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.777" offset="1346372">And third, that respondent’s consent to the search of his automobile was invalid because he had not been told that he could withhold his consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.389" offset="1384824">The District Court denied the motion and respondent’s trial proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.570" offset="1405617">He was convicted by the jury on two counts, involving the credit cards found under the floor mat of his automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.304" offset="1436546">He was acquitted on a count involving the credit card turned over six days earlier to the informant, by the informant rather to the inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.863" offset="1478760">The divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.417" offset="1492971">The majority concluded that the information gathered by Inspector Barbarick from the informant was reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.589" offset="1517630">It was confirmed by physical receipt of a stolen credit card, that it did provide probable cause to arrest respondent, and therefore, it rejected that argument that respondent had made.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.825" offset="1570607">It held, however, that because the officers had not sought or obtained a warrant for respondent’s arrest during the six days between the acquisition of probable cause in the meeting at the restaurant, the arrest was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.780" offset="1622434">Proceeding from that conclusion, the majority then held that the consent respondent gave to search his automobile was defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.291" offset="1656497">It purported to adhere to the totality of all the circumstances test annunciated by this Court in Schneckloth against Bustamonte, but stated nevertheless that the consent was involuntary because respondent was in custody in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="404.750" offset="1722326">Do you think the Court of Appeals' holding amounted to a statement that a respondent like the one here who had been illegally arrested could not under any conceivable circumstances give a valid consent to a search of his car?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="419.144" stopTime="462.472">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="419.144" offset="1779900">Well, I think the Court of Appeals did not expressly put it in on those words, but every single fact that would bear on the actual voluntariness of respondent’s actions tended to point toward voluntariness and I think it must be viewed in effect upon analysis as a per se rule there would be three factors: (1) custody (2) illegal and (3) the lack of a specific Miranda type warning of a right to withhold consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.539" offset="1909467">although as I will argue later, there was effectively a communication of the right to withhold consent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.107" offset="1943740">The case thus presents the court today with two issues.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="462.472" stopTime="475.835">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="462.472" offset="1953248">Excuse me Mr. Frey, you mean to say they made the per se rule, do you think they made a per se rule both on the arrest factor and on the consent or just only consent?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="475.835" stopTime="508.981">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="475.835" offset="2006643">Well, the rule on the arrest issue would turn on certain facts I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.264" offset="2040393">In other words, it would turn on the question of whether there was an opportunity, whether in fact they had acquired probable cause, whether they had an opportunity subsequent to the acquisition of probable cause to obtain a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.594" offset="2089712">The rule then would be that an arrest is illegal if they had acquired probable cause and had passed up the opportunity to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.340" offset="2124716">So in that sense I suppose it is a per se rule.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="508.981" stopTime="516.811">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="508.981" offset="2139240">The only fact of determination left to be made is on the time, is that not so?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="516.811" stopTime="532.446">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="516.811" offset="2170587">I think it would be equivalent to the emergency doctrine for search warrants of homes, that is the government would be required to show exigent circumstances that justify the failure to get a warrant, otherwise the arrest would be unlawful.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="532.446" stopTime="539.348">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="532.446" offset="2233072">Well, what cases held that a warrant must be obtained simply because there is time to obtain it?</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="539.348" stopTime="540.131">

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="540.131" offset="2263792">Yes.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="542.199" offset="2272151">So that they have established the rule that if there is time to get a warrant, an arrest without a warrant is invalid, is that not the holding here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="551.340" stopTime="554.278">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="551.340" offset="2308618">That is correct and it is definitely a new rule.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="554.278" stopTime="557.676">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="554.278" offset="2320425">A per se rule, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="557.676" stopTime="1095.669">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="557.676" offset="2334009">Yes, it is a per se rule, although unlikely rule on -- the rule on the consent issue, you look at three relatively concrete isolated and inflexible kinds of facts and if you find those three facts then there cannot be a valid consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.598" offset="2405689">Here there is a factual inquiry into exigent circumstances which cannot be pinned down as quite as specific a narrow inquiry, but it is a per se rule ones you gotten across the factual threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.326" offset="2468592">Now, the two questions that are presented to the court today, both the question regarding the need to obtain a warrant for and arrest and the question regarding the ability of one in custody and in illegal custody to consent to a search are questions of great practical importance to everyday law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.439" offset="2549049">I believe, turning first to the arrest issue, that it would be a considerable understatement to say that decision of the Court of Appeals represents a sharp break with tradition and history.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.175" offset="2591994">The Federal rule, the rule in each of the 50 states, the common rule, the rule I dare say that each of you learn as black letter law during your first year criminal law course in law school is that a law enforcement officer may make a warrantless arrest for felony on the basis of probable cause, at least so long as the arrest does not entail an entering to a dwelling or similar place.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.083" offset="2695648">This proposition has been recognized in numerous decisions of this Court during the past 50 years from the Carroll case to last term’s decision in Gerstein against Pugh.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.220" offset="2740161">It is reflected in Section 3061 of Title XVIII of the United States Code which authorized Inspector Barbarick to arrest respondent without a warrant on the very circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.767" offset="2794391">Neither we nor respondent have been able to find a single case in the entire annals of Anglo-American jurisprudence holding otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.264" offset="2832321">The Court of Appeals relied on the Coolidge case, but I think it is quite clear that Coolidge does not support the conclusion it reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.343" offset="2864713">Coolidge was clearly and repeatedly focused upon the problem of an entry into a dwelling or similar place, a privacy invasion of that nature in connection with an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.091" offset="2911629">We have no similar ingredient in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.599" offset="2929705">Given this background then, I submit that even if it were otherwise desirable, this Court would not be free to overturn this consistent and heavyweight of precedent and to hold that this time for the first time, warrants are required as a constitutional matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.869" offset="3002744">Even if the court did consider itself free as a jurisprudential matter to adapt a radical constitutional departure embodied in the holding of the Court of Appeals, there are good reasons of policy and practice that counsel against such as then and we have made these arguments in our brief and we advance them without intending in any way to minimize the seriousness of being arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.634" offset="3105875">We recognize that an arrest is an intrusion into individual liberty of substantial dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.385" offset="3132834">We recognize that the this Court has repeatedly looked carefully at the circumstances surrounding an arrest and has required that the officers have substantial justification amounting to probable cause in order to make a lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.457" offset="3201170">The question here of course is whether a warrant should be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.094" offset="3227710">I think there is one structural difference which I would like to mention this morning between a search of a dwelling which this Court has recognized in the absence of exigent circumstances does require a warrant and an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.697" offset="3302107">If a warrantless search is made and items are seized or indeed, if nothing is seized, there is no judicial accounting that necessarily takes place as a result of that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.883" offset="3350799">It may never come to the attention of the courts, indeed this is the problem I think that underlies the whole rational of the warrant requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.598" offset="3393745">The reason that has impelled this Court to impose a warrant requirement is to ensure some degree of judicial supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.684" offset="3434078">Only upon a motion for suppression of evidence or return of property which may be made many months later by the person who was the subject of the search is their judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.907" offset="3478904">Quite the contrary is the case where an individual is arrested, the law, both federally and in the states and as a result of Gerstein against Pugh requires a reasonably prompt judicial determination of the adequacy of the grounds underlying the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.547" offset="3553510">This to us is a substantial counterweight neutralizing to some extent the desirability that otherwise might be viewed to exist for obtaining a warrant prior to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.484" offset="3609203">There are also a lot of practical problems with requiring an arrest warrant and this case I think illustrates very well some of those problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.117" offset="3647759">Even when suspicion focuses on a suspect, the decision whether or not to arrest them is often not made immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.758" offset="3682345">Instead, further investigation is undertaken, either with the goal of securing additional evidence or alternatively of demonstrating the suspect’s innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.304" offset="3724559">Here an effort was made to obtain further confirmation by catching respondent red-handed with stolen credit cards, if it was possible to do so and indeed it was successful in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.202" offset="3780148">Now, respondent seeks to explain a way our arguments that it is undesirable to force officers to seek warrants as soon as they have acquired probable cause by saying that well, the police can wait.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.326" offset="3824661">They do not have to acquire a warrant right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.116" offset="3839812">The only thing they have to do is get a warrant before making the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.339" offset="3856634">But I think that argument does not work because as in this case, once the decision is made to arrest, the need often is sudden to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.612" offset="3897803">Here in other words, the investigation was proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.044" offset="3907521">I think it is quite apparent for my recitation of the facts that no decision had been made whether or not to arrest the respondent or when to arrest him, until the signal was given in the restaurant which indicated that he was in possession of additional stolen credit cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.697" offset="3966140">At that point, he was -- the officers had probable cause to believe that he was then and there committing a new crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.374" offset="3992785">Not to say that because they have failed to get a warrant previously, they were powerless to arrest them seems to me a very undesirable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.267" offset="4028416">Indeed, even if the innovation of the Court of Appeals in constitutional law of arrest were correct as a general proposition, it was wrongly applied to this case because here there was probable cause, fresh probable cause to arrest the respondent for a fresh offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.009" offset="4107305">I would like to turn the question of the voir dire of respondent’s consent to the search of his automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.655" offset="4133950">And I hark back to some of the facts of the case as I stated earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.536" offset="4153490">The respondent knew the arresting officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.649" offset="4161954">He was on a first name basis with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.220" offset="4172194">The situation was casual even friendly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.397" offset="4184941">And the dialogue indicated a request for consent to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.815" offset="4206571">A consent followed, by a warning that if anything were found it would go against the respondent, followed by a repeated, almost a demand that the inspector search the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.767" offset="4266339">So obvious from those facts, the respondent not only willingly consented to the search, but that he believe it would benefit him because the inspector would fail to find the stolen mail that respondent had hidden under the floor mat of his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.886" offset="4322868">It is also clear I think from the facts, although the Court of Appeals says otherwise, that respondent knew he did not have to consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.423" offset="4352961">Again, under the holding of this Court in Schneckloth an actual concrete warning with respect to the right to withhold consent is not necessary and its presence or absence is simply a fact that could be taken into account, presumably that means that it is to be taken into account realistically on the facts of this case and where an arrested person is practically insisting that his car be searched, I think it is difficult to find that there was not voluntary consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1101.723" offset="4510218">Absolutely and I am turning to that next.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.559" offset="4517532">It is true that Schneckloth explicitly refrained from passing on the custodial situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.240" offset="4556298">However, six Courts of Appeals that we have been able to find the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits all have passed on that issue and indeed the Court below in this case said that consent alone just like the lack of a warning of a right to withhold consent is not a per se factor that would be automatically dispositive of the validity of the consent, but custody is a factor to be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.578" offset="4685657">It seems to me clear that if a person in custody can give a valid confession as Miranda recognizes he can, that a person in custody can give a valid consent to a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.221" offset="4744171">Of course if he has been taken away and he spent six hours in the back room of a police station, that would be a significant factor in evaluating the voluntariness of his consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.302" offset="4804566">So I think that it is not necessary to dwell at substantial length on the factor of custody because it seems to me that the overall reasoning and structure of the Schneckloth decision and the principles that underlay it apply equally to the factor of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.314" offset="4884605">It is possible to look at custody and to determine the circumstances of custody and from that to make a decision whether or not the consent that is given to a search is a voluntary consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.132" offset="4935805">And there is I think no need for per se rule and the Courts of Appeals seem to be in universal agreement on that question.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="1237.648" offset="5053879">Right, it was on the street prompt consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.065" offset="5071537">And that the -- of course the period of time that passed would be significant in the Rothman case in the Ninth Circuit which was cited by the Court of Appeals and then cited by my opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.189" offset="5108109">Several hours had passed, during which repeated requests had been made to the suspect in custody to permit the search of his bag and he had refused over and over and finally he was told that the officers would get a warrant, although in fact they have not the least basis to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.377" offset="5172788">And at that point, he said, well, what the heck, go ahead and search it, but that is quite a different case from what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.023" offset="5207374">So turning from the fact of custody alone to the question of the illegal nature of the custody and I am assuming arguendo for purposes of this argument that respondent’s custody was illegal, it is clear that the illegality is in almost all cases totally irrelevant to the kind of voluntariness analysis that was applied in Schneckloth for assessing the validity of a consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.382" offset="5312804">The voluntariness of respondent's consent could not possibly have been affected by what he did not know to wit that the Court of Appeals two years later would hold that his arrest was illegal for lack of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.409" offset="5372990">Since the legality or illegality of the arrest could not have impinged on his consciousness or indeed on the consciousness of the postal inspectors under circumstances of this case, unless the Court is going to simply throw away the voluntariness analysis, the illegality cannot play a role in that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.914" offset="5455015">So in connection with the consent I think the only colorable issue that really exists is the fruit of the poisonous tree question and that is a question that was no adverted to at all or relied upon in any way by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.955" offset="5515097">In other words, the argument is whether or not the consent was voluntary if it was the product of an illegal arrest, part of the deterrent purposes of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule might be served by treating the consent as invalid fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.463" offset="5581134">We think such an argument is untenable on the facts of this case and we think that that result is clear from this Court’s decision in Brown against Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.393" offset="5624915">In Brown, the Court asked the question whether the statements there obtained by an illegally arrested individual after he had been given Miranda Warnings, but during a period of illegal detention were obtained by exploitation of the illegality of his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.880" offset="5702865">The court rejected any “but for” rule that said simply it would be enough for the defendant to show that he might not have made the statement or here he might not have consented had he not been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.896" offset="5754901">Instead it looked at exploitation of illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.266" offset="5768380">It looked at the behavior of the officers in the case, particularly said the Court at page 13 of the slip opinion, the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.347" offset="5816654">In the present case, there was not and there could not have been any exploitation of the illegality that existed in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.042" offset="5859495">The illegality, if there was any, was not that they have no right to arrest him as such, not that there was not adequate justification for taking Mr. Watson into custody, but that they did not possess a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.033" offset="5915397">Now, of course their possession are non-possession of a warrant can have no possible bearing on whether or not a consent would be given to search of the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.085" offset="5955625">Consequently, it seems to me quite clear that they could have been in the circumstances of this case, no exploitation of an illegality for the purpose of obtaining a consent and that under Brown, I think is the pertinent criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.187" offset="6012050">So I think in this case we have the consent as an independent voluntary act, untainted by any legality that there may have been in the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.374" offset="6064817">Finally, in connection with the consent issue, I would like to point out that respondent did not testify at the suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.825" offset="6102643">He never got up and said one word about the involuntariness, one word about his state of mind in granting the consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.149" offset="6147887">There was no contradiction of the inspector’s version of the events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.906" offset="6166904">Now, unless there is to be a per se rule, I think that a defendant is going to have a very difficult time establishing voluntariness without getting on the stand and then of course, there are no self-incrimination problems because his testimony at the suppression hearing could not be used against him in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.353" offset="6236703">So we do not have Fifth Amendment justification for not taking the stand and I submit that ordinarily, unless the other evidence demonstrates plainly that the consent was involuntary that the absence of testimony by a defendant would be a very significant factor in the voluntariness inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.730" offset="6326251">So for all of these reasons, we request this Court to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and to reinstate respondent’s conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.287" offset="6368465">I will reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3431.607" offset="13829768">It would not affect whether or not he had probable cause, but the point I want to make is that even if he subjectively believed he was arresting for the old credit card, the existence of probable cause with respect to the additional stolen credit cards would support the arrest and there are several cases that hold that that I would like to call for the Court’s attention in light of the argument that has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.445" offset="13929137">In United States against Martinez, a second Circuit decision 465 F 2d 79 and Ramirez against Rodriguez, 467 F 2d 822, a Tenth Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.523" offset="13989428">There are some others, but the point is there that if the officer believes he is arresting for one offense for which he does not have probable cause, but in fact the facts known to him give him probable cause to arrest for a different offense, the arrest is lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.793" offset="14046479">Similarly if an officer is proceeding under warrant which turns out to be invalid, the Court then looks to see whether probable cause existed for the arrest and indeed that was the analytical approach taken in the Coolidge case by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.113" offset="14119727">Now, also as a practical matter, the suggestion is that in the vast majority of cases, this warrant requirement would not apply because in most cases there would be a danger of escape or something of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.081" offset="14175629">But of course there are holdings in the search and seizure area that exigent circumstances at the moment you under take the search may not be enough to support the search if you had an opportunity prior there to obtain a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.575" offset="14233621">The case that comes immediately to mind is Vale against Louisiana in which it was clear once Vale was arrested on the doorstep of his house, that there were indeed exigent circumstances for searching his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.954" offset="14287119">If the Court said that could not justify the failure to obtain a search warrant before going, so that the logic of respondent’s principle would have a substantially broad impact and it is not just a very narrow, small category of cases that would be effected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.402" offset="14352948">As for the desirability of getting the courts involved in this, it seems to me that runs contrary to the Robinson case which recognized that there were certain principles in the law of arrest that were well established and that it was undesirable to disrupt those principles and to introduce a whole new realm of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.410" offset="14432987">Finally on the false bravado point, the record shows that the search actually took 15 minutes before the envelope was found, and certainly it was not obvious to Mr. Watson that the inspectors would find the envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.361" offset="14488785">I have nothing further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.182" offset="14492024">Thank you.</text>
