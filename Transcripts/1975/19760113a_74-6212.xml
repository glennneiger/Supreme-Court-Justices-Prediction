            <text syncTime="42.143" offset="271902">Fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.559" offset="273574">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.257" offset="284336">In 1969, Gregory Norton Jr. then aged 5-years old, applied for Child Insurance Benefits with the Social Security Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.540" offset="321430">Title 2 of the Social Security Act, allows children whose fathers have become disabled, have reached a certain age or who have died and whose fathers worked and were covered by Social Security employment for a requisite number of quarters, to receive death benefits, at least death benefits in the Norton Case, upon the death.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.607" offset="429786">Gregory Norton applied for these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.645" offset="445878">He applied for the benefits after his father was killed in the Vietnam war and Gregory is illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.823" offset="474612">His mother and his father were not married.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.360" offset="484748">Now, the Act is so structured, now I will just on this briefly because it is not totally relevant to the jurisdictional argument, but the Act is so structured that most other children who were applying for Child Insurance Benefits have to, in addition to several not very controversial prerequisites, have to establish that they indeed are the son or the daughter of the wage earner i.e. he has to establish paternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.487" offset="585267">Now, Gregory Norton’s class have to establish another fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.603" offset="601672">They also have to establish in addition to paternity, that they were either living with or supported by the deceased wage earner at the time he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.206" offset="640124">Gregory Norton filed the cause of action in the Federal District Court to challenge the constitutionality on the Fifth Amendment Equal Protection concepts of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.231" offset="688189">A suit was filed in the United States District Court for Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.253" offset="700310">In that suit, there were various jurisdictional basis asserted, 28 U.S.C 1331, APA jurisdiction, mandamus jurisdiction, 1361 and also jurisdiction under the statutory review procedures, 42 U.S.C 405 (g).</text>
            <text syncTime="170.893" offset="786932">The suit was also classed, stated to be a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.742" offset="806263">The United States District Court in its initial opinion, held in its opinion that a class was to be certified, but on the merits that ruled against the Norton claim by three to nothing vote, in a Three-Judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.479" offset="865195">An appeal was then taken from that adverse decision to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.068" offset="879615">This Court, shortly after this court decided the Jimenez case, Jimenez v. Weinberger, remanded this case back to the Three-Judge Court for reconsideration in light of the Jimenez case.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.887" offset="930815">On remand, the Three-Judge Court, this time by 2 to 1 vote upheld the constitutionality of the statutory provision that Gregory Norton was attacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.546" offset="969476">An appeal was then brought again to this Court and that is where we are today.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.683" offset="990060">Incidentally, there is another issue that has now been waived by Gregory Norton and that is an issue that he indeed was, in fact in the court, and therefore, met the prerequisite of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.163" offset="1031961">That decision was decided adversely to Gregory Norton.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.096" offset="1043664">He waives the -- he has not appealed that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.070" offset="1055576">His only issue in this case, in addition to the jurisdictional issues, is whether or not the act is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.433" offset="1081071">Because if it is not, then he does not have to establish that he was either supported by or resided with his deceased wage earner father.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.028" offset="1119419">This case can only come to this Court, if it comes from a properly convened Three-Judge Court in the District of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.542" offset="1153482">We are alleging jurisdiction in this Court now, pursuant to 28 U.S.C 1253.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.477" offset="1177202">That statute requires in turn that a review can only be had from decisions properly convened Three-Judge District Court granting or denying injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.032" offset="1219416">Accordingly, we are properly here, as the Three-Judge Court in this case properly had the power to issue an injunctive relief and the kind of injunctive relief that would seek to stop enforcement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.316" offset="1280542">This we contend, it did have the power to do and this basically was the core argument on the jurisdictional issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.377" offset="1320771">We have two major routes by which this think this Court -- to either one of which this Court, could get to the final solution that there indeed is injunctive power in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.598" offset="1369672">One route is by looking at Section 205 (g) of the Social Security Act which is 42 U.S.C Section 405 (g) and that is the provision of the Act which was highlighted in this Court’s recent decision in Weinberger v. Salfi.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.365" offset="1424738">And by looking at that statute itself and getting it from the words of that statute or from how that statute should be interpreted in light of the general statutory interpretation rules should apply in this situation or secondly, if 205 (g) cannot do it by itself, we contended the APA who gives the power to -- for a Federal District Court, if not given the power explicitly by the statutory review statute to issue injunctive relief, sort of as an ancillary remedy to what is provided by the statutory review section.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="363.985" offset="1559216">But in order to get in under the APA, you have to show that the statutory remedy otherwise provided is inadequate?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="c_christopher_brown" startTime="370.277" stopTime="476.209">
            <label>Mr. C. Christopher Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="370.277" offset="1584398">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.418" offset="1588996">That s true.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.698" offset="1590145">I hope to be able to point that out today.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.650" offset="1605923">First, the general presumption which seems to run throughout the cases of this Court that were decided this century, is that barring an explicit declaration by Congress to the contrary, there is a general presumption of reviewability.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.044" offset="1663497">Now also, I think that cases can be read to establish, there is a general presumption that a District Court which is an equity court has brought equitable powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.454" offset="1701113">Now, admittedly each case that has been decided thus far deals with a specific agency and it is where they expected, the words of each statutory review, provision for each of the agency are not the same as being counted on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.129" offset="1755866">Accordingly, I admit that there is no case right on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.168" offset="1767987">But, there are many cases which seemed not to be limited in any way and accordingly would be applicable to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.462" offset="1793169">So basically, we are beginning our argument on the assumption that there is a general presumption that the court of equity, which the United States District Court is now, with the combination of law and equity, can grant all relief that is necessary to make the parties whole, unless the Congress specifically said that they cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.376" offset="1868820">205 (g) of the Social Security Act, as is pertinent to this case, merely says the following that the District Court after certain prerequisites have been met which Gregory Norton has met in this case, the District Court should have the power to affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the Secretary and we contend that there is nothing in those three words which in any way indicates a congressional intent to negate injunctive relief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.335" offset="1980624">If anything, perhaps the word “reversal” could be read to include the power to issue reverse by an injunctive relief --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="476.209" stopTime="501.542">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="476.209" offset="2008104">Well, is it not though that perhaps the more accurate question to ask is whether the injunctive authority that is as you say is generally available to the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.628" offset="2049796">Is there any way necessary to carry out where the statute – what this statute requires the District Court to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.750" offset="2078322">I mean, can it not fully accomplish what the Congress has intended that it do, by simply setting aside the decision of the Secretary?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="c_christopher_brown" startTime="501.542" stopTime="626.073">
            <label>Mr. C. Christopher Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="501.542" offset="2109460">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.942" offset="2111027">I will move on to that point right now, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.305" offset="2124506">If we look at how the Act works and how impractically the needs of the people litigating in this area, the needs of claimants who are attempting to obtain Social Security benefits, we see on two different levels that there are very many practical needs as to why a claimant actually does need injunctive relief as opposed to any other kind of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.607" offset="2201724">Now, I think that if we look at those needs and imagine what the Congress must have imagined and indeed, the Congress has not said very much on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.910" offset="2234952">We are basically not working with any explicit statutory history.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.127" offset="2251775">We look at the needs for injunctive relief that I would submit the Congress could no way have intended to not allow an equity court to issue injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.876" offset="2290854">First of all on the individual basis, now look at this on an individual basis and on the class wide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.929" offset="2311020">On individual basis, when an individual claimant receives the benefit, there is no necessary guarantee that he is going to be paid that benefit in a prompt fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.798" offset="2346547">Indeed, there may be cases when that individual may want to be able to get benefits before a final judgment is issued i.e. he may want to apply to a court for preliminary injunction or something such as that to give benefits before the District Court has finally decided the ultimate merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.065" offset="2415615">Here is an example where that could be very helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.344" offset="2428676">In this Lucas case for instance, the oldest of Lucas’ daughter, was past the age of 18, she is now past the age of 18, you cannot get these benefits if you are past 18, unless you are still on school.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.319" offset="2476532">Now, in her case, she could not still be in school unless she had the money not to have to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.683" offset="2494087">So in many individual cases, there may be have instances in which the prerequisites of a preliminary injunction have been met by an individual parting and for instance in this situation where you have someone who has strong need for the benefits it could very clearly be a situation in which they could establish the various equities and so forth to get a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.682" offset="2570051">That would be one kind of an injunctive relief, but admittedly, that would be the kind of injunctive relief you need in order to have a Three-Judge Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.206" offset="2596173">That would not enjoin the enforcement of the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="626.073" stopTime="649.328">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="626.073" offset="2607562">Will that injunction be very useful, if the case was on review?</text>
            <text syncTime="633.301" offset="2636506">It is very likely that if we decided to take the case that, that would be enough also to suggest the likelihood of a stay of the injunction until the merits were decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.775" offset="2686452">So, how would that get any money in the pocket of the recipient?</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Christopher Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="649.328" offset="2700663">Well, then the government would have to come in and fight against the preliminary injunction motion and they would balance the equities in that situation, and either win or they lose or if the decision was issued favorably to the individual claimant, the way normal cases work, that claimant gets the fruits of their victory at that point, unless the other side comes in and requests a stay, pending appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.515" offset="2813407">For instance, one another case, it was here on summary affirmance is Griffin v. Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.563" offset="2829603">In that case, the Three-Judge Court held another provision in Social Security Act unconstitutional, violating the illegitimate children’s rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.748" offset="2858338">The government came in and asked for a stay, pending appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.614" offset="2869727">They said that $50 million is going to have to be paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.903" offset="2878922">That is too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.960" offset="2883102">That is what the Supreme Court does.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.205" offset="2892088">The Three-judge Court unanimously denied their request for a stay, pending appeal and Mr. Justice Burger, you affirmed that denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.211" offset="2924167">The benefits were paid out by the Social Security Administration or at least the process was begun before this Court summarily affirmed that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.503" offset="2957290">Now, that is just one situation and each case would have to be decided on its own individual merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.155" offset="2979964">I think that it is even more.</text>

            <text syncTime="1532.645" offset="6233881">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.777" offset="6246420">The United States takes the position in this case that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.756" offset="6278289">Our contentions in this regard may be summarized by the following five points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.886" offset="6298873">First, the appellant’s individual claim for relief did not require the convening of a Three-Judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.692" offset="6330116">Second, the District Court lacked the subject matter jurisdiction over the class designated by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.560" offset="6361567">Third, although the District Court may have possessed subject matter jurisdiction over a far more narrowly defined class of claimants, a suit on behalf of that class would not be cognizable under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.757" offset="6422380">Fourth, even if such a class action were cognizable under the rules, the class would nevertheless been unable to assert a substantial claim for an injunctive relief, and therefore, under no circumstances would a Three-Judge Court have been required to hear that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.715" offset="6486119">And fifth and finally, since the Three-Judge Court was not required, this Court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.204" offset="6516108">I will now elaborate on these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.398" offset="6532931">I begin the analysis by distinguishing between the appellant's individual claim and the claim for class relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.407" offset="6560934">I will first take up the jurisdictional aspects of appellant’s individual claim for relief and then discuss the implications of his request for certification of the action as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.984" offset="6619239">The appellant’s suit on his own behalf was brought to review a decision of the Secretary denying him child’s insurance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.588" offset="6649646">As such, that suit was governed by the second sentence of Section 205 (h) of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.004" offset="6679321">That sentence provides in essence, “No decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any court except as provided by Section 205 (g) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.082" offset="6719654">In turn, Section 205 (g) requires an exhaustion of administrative remedies by restricting the District Court’s jurisdiction to the review of final decisions made by the Secretary after a hearing and within 60 days prior to the filing of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.177" offset="6787990">Now, it is conceded here that the appellant did exhaust his administrative remedies and the District Court concededly had subject matter jurisdiction over his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.330" offset="6832607">Our contention however, is that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to grant an appellant’s request for individual injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.660" offset="6865940">Section 205 (g) as it has been made clear, confers on the District Court’s power only to and I quote from the statute “Enter a judgment affirming, reversing or modifying the decision of the Secretary.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2156.818" offset="8730560">But it summarizes that our position as to the individual claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.734" offset="8746233">First, we believed that there is no injunctive authority as such because the statute does not embrace it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.030" offset="8775386">Secondly, that if the statute does, in fact, embrace such injunctive authority and nevertheless injunctive relief would always be inappropriate as to an individual claimant because an individual claimant always has an adequate remedy at law in the form of a reversal of denial of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.885" offset="8862844">An individual claimant never needs an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.045" offset="8875487">The opposing counsel suggested that he might need preliminary injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.668" offset="8893982">I would make two comments with regard to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.975" offset="8903177">First, such preliminary relief would be no more appropriate here than it was in Samson against Kennedy, excuse me, Samson against Murray, where it was held that the Back Pay Act prevents injunctive relief on behalf of the individual federal employees who are seeking to avoid dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.416" offset="9000980">And secondly, as opposing counsel has conceded, preliminary relief of that kind is not the kind of relief that would entitle the claimant to a Three-Judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.184" offset="9052075">Therefore, it is our review that if the appellant is to prevail in this case, he must establish that the class action was appropriate, that a Three-Judge Court was required, if at all, and we think not, only if a class action was appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.737" offset="9606289">Let me turn now to the question of the propriety of class relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.559" offset="9621544">We begin with the fundamental proposition that the District may entertain a class action only if it has subject matter jurisdiction over the claims of the individual members of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.541" offset="9669505">Now, appellant contends here that subject matter jurisdiction over the claims of the class existed here under the mandamus statute or the administrative procedure act and we answer, that contention, I believe in full in pages 13 through 18 of our brief in this case, not only summarize our points with regards to that aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.789" offset="9754456">We point out there that first, this Court in Salfi rejected that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.718" offset="9774204">The Court held that Section 205 (h) of the statute, third sentence of that provision, forecloses all non-Social Security Act sources of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.752" offset="9818299">Secondly, we think that the Salfi decision is plainly correct because it effectuates the clear congressional intention of restricting social security suits to cases in which the claimant has exhausted his administrative remedies as provided by Section 205 (g).</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.598" offset="9897711">And third, we point out that if the appellant’s position with respect to the mandamus statute were accepted, that would lead to results so anomalous as to be untenable because it would provide for jurisdiction only as to those persons as whose claims were the least right for adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.744" offset="9978273">Accordingly, for all these reasons, the only source, the only possible source of subject-matter jurisdiction over the class was Section 205 (g), but the jurisdiction conferred by Section 205 (g) clearly did not extend to the claims of the class designated by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.090" offset="10051624">Section 205 (g) confers jurisdiction, only over suits brought to review a final decision of the Secretary, after a hearing, made within 60 days prior to the filing of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.222" offset="10100212">The appellant in his complaint and the District Court in its opinion, defined the class far more broadly to include and I quote here from the District Court opinion, “All of those persons otherwise eligible for child’s insurance benefits who cannot qualify for such benefits solely because they cannot meet the requirement that they would be living with or supported by their father on the date of his death.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.127" offset="10199791">That class embraces many individuals who had no right to sue in their own behalf under Section 205 (g) and the District Court plainly had no subject matter jurisdiction over the claims of that class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.314" offset="10252558">Thus, our position is that here as in Salfi, the designation of a class and a complaint was plainly deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.429" offset="10285055">The complaint contained no allegations that the class members and I here quote from the Salfi opinion, “have even filed an application with the Secretary, much less that he has rendered any decision, final or otherwise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.484" offset="10333224">For the government, this is probably the most important single point in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.752" offset="10354331">The government’s primary interest is in obtaining a re-affirmance of the Salfi holding that the District Courts in social security cases may not award class relief to individuals who do not themselves have a right to bring suit under Section 205 (g).</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.980" offset="10423190">Problems faced by the social security administration in administering very broad and loosely defined classes, a relief as to such classes, I mean, in some cases, be literally insurmountable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.013" offset="10471360">There is no statutory basis for awarding benefits to such class and it should be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.170" offset="10499990">In propriety of the class designation and Salfi was the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.151" offset="10515873">We think that it should be the end of the matter here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.208" offset="10528098">The District Court lacked jurisdiction over the class that the appellant sought to represent, and therefore, was without power to consider any request on behalf of that class by the injunctive relief or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.888" offset="10570834">It follows that the Three-Judge Court was not required to be convened and this Court does not have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.404" offset="10596957">Now, with that said, as I understand the appellant’s argument here, he seems to contend that the District Court, in fact, had jurisdiction over a more narrowly defined class of claimants and that the proper remedy, although he does not expressly so state, maybe to vacate the decision below and remand it for recertification of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.351" offset="10684728">I would to take some time to explore the ramifications of that suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.998" offset="10707298">It is true that it is a purely technical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.147" offset="10719941">Section 205 (g) does appear to leave some room for possible jointer of a very narrow class of plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.778" offset="10750452">It permits the District Courts to review the decisions of the Secretary, final decisions to the Secretary, rendered after hearing within 60 days of the filing of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.688" offset="10790054">Thus appellant’s redefined class would presumably be those applicants for child’s insurance benefits whose applications were denied on the same basis, the same grounds as the appellant’s request within 60 days prior to the filing of the appellant's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.069" offset="10855569">I would make two points with regard to such a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.385" offset="10868839">First, it is very unlikely that the certification of such a class would be permissible under rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.390" offset="10908859">This is so for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.389" offset="10916904">First, Rule 23 (a) (1) requires the class to be so numerous as to make jointer of individual plaintiffs impracticable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.413" offset="10956924">This requirement is not likely to be met by appellant’s class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.558" offset="10973538">Indeed, the appellant may be the only member of this class and if there are any other members, they are very likely to be few in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.665" offset="11010005">Second, Rule 23 (a) (3) requires that the individual plaintiff’s claim be typical of those with the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.265" offset="11044382">That is not the case here and it is not likely ever to be the case or very likely to be the case in the social security context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.343" offset="11076669">Most suits are for review, and this is true of appellant’s suit here, may or will turn upon the substantiality of the evidence on which the Secretary’s factual findings were based.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.352" offset="11120764">The appellant, for example, contested the Secretary’s finding that his father had not been living with or supporting him at the time of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.602" offset="11153678">Similar factual claims might be made by every disappointed claimant that the appellant seeks to represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.799" offset="11186488">He has abandoned it here, but that does not bear upon the question of whether his class was properly certifiable under Rule 23 (a) (3) --</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.354" offset="12680692">The class that we are requesting in this case is the same class that was found in -- well, I will call it Jimenez II to be a fair and probably defined class, consists of people who would only be contesting this one constitutional basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.022" offset="12771389">As Mr. Justice Stevens’ suggestion, what we would call Jimenez II, the class could be tolled by the filing of the initial complaint so that there would be a broad number of people in the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.823" offset="12806602">I personally have five clients who I think would be in the class right now.</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.198" offset="12856131">The District Court incidentally, did not have the benefit of this Court's Salfi opinion when it first encountered this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.754" offset="12882358">It think that it is only fair that the District Court, if we went on the merits, they got another chance to comply with Salfi and was not able to do so and Salfi was a surprise in many ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.899" offset="12918929">I think that this Court’s decision as to retroactivity and so forth are such that the District Court deserves a second chance to define and use the correct words in its class definition.</text>
