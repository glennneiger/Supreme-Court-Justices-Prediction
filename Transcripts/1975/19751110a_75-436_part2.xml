            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2.826" offset="11285">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.391" offset="25496">Before the recess, I had to confess to Justice Brennan my ignorance on one point, but is now been relieved Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.875" offset="63425">An analysis of the relationship between possible spending ceilings and past experience based, of course, on 72 rather than 74 because 74 had not happened, it was submitted to the congressional committees chiefly by common cause and it was essentially the same kind of analysis that I made.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.341" offset="161332">If you care for the references, you will find it in the hearings on H-7612, 93rd Congress, First Session which was in October and November 1973, and similarly on hearings on S-1103 at the same Congress and the same session.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.913" offset="263628">At that time, I may say, and then I would like to go on, the common cause representatives were arguing that care must be taken not to set the ceilings too low and the quotations that my friend has referred to, complaining that if the ceiling was too low, it would discriminate against challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.020" offset="352026">It was during a time when much lower ceilings were being discussed than appear in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.416" offset="381597">Now, I would like, during the moments remaining to me, to address myself to Section 608 (e) of the statute which has been mentioned several times this morning, that is the Section which deals with the so called independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.643" offset="454531">If an expenditure, a spending of money in the loose sense, is requested by a candidate or his committee or is otherwise made with his authority, then it is a contribution and counts against this overall ceilings.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.545" offset="518165">If the spending is done without any kind of authority from the candidate than it falls under Section 608 (e) and if it exceeds $1,000.00, it would be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.951" offset="571768">To put the discussion of that Section in context, may I first recall portions that I will have to leave to my brief, having stated as we did, the applicable constitutional principle this morning, then of course a complete exposition would call first three showings I did seek to show that adequate opportunities were to remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.198" offset="672705">Second, that the purposes of this legislation where indeed compelling, the purposes as we see them are first, to protect the honor and integrity of government operations in both the legislative and executive branches against the corrosive influence of large contributions, the pressure to raise large money and the resulting sense of indebtedness which of course does not affect every contribution, but there appear to have been too many of that character.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.718" offset="822857">Its concern with the public’s confidence in its government against the appearance of things when government favors, follow such large contributions and its concern with giving the small donor an equal voice with the large donor, not in speaking, but in opportunity to reach that candidate, the large donor money.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.553" offset="914181">Now, we say that Section 608 (e), the limit on independent expenditures is essential to the effectuation of those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.051" offset="960157">Very briefly, if there were no such provision in the statute, then instead of making a contribution of 5, 10 or $50,000.00, someone would just spend it, take over all a candidate’s advertising in Lawrence, Massachusetts or take over the broadcasting of film clips of his previous speeches or his television spot and surely in this aspect of 608 (e), it is essentially like a contribution, it is money that a person who spends it is putting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.481" offset="1101845">He is not putting out his own words or his own ideas. He is not engaged in personal activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.310" offset="1409149">Now, I am not making anything turn on that except by assertion that in the case where the individual has no personal participation, it is just like a contribution, then I say --</text>

            <text syncTime="388.331" offset="1553241">Indeed, my essential proposition is that an intelligible line cannot be drawn and that the reason Congress included 608 (e) as it did, was that it decided that the most sensible line was between personal participation in campaigning or in speaking, in doing things yourselves in personal services and spending money and it drew the line there because there was no other very satisfactory way of doing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.641" offset="2030550">First, I would say that in fact individuals do not, just a matter of observation, spend large sums of money, broadcasting their own speeches, putting their own writings in newspapers and second, the reason I emphasize my agreement with the proposition that the line can hardly be drawn between personal involvement in a paid advertisement that no real personal involvement in the paid advertisement, the reason I stress that is that they chose the importance of Section 608 (e) to the whole plan, that this would be as the Court below recognize an exceedingly serious loophole.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.827" offset="2287282">I point out that there is no plaintiff here who alleges that he or she desires to spend money publicizing his or her own speech and that this most extreme application of 608 (e) might well be treated as hypothetical, not properly before the Court and the argument of overbreadth could and I think should be rejected on the ground that through most of its application, Section 608 (e) is like the restriction on contributions, and that therefore, the doctrine of overbreadth does not apply and the particular cases can be dealt with if and when they ever arise.</text>

            <text syncTime="923.499" offset="3693923">Let me just briefly clear up one part point of confusion, found on one of our appendix page 39.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.376" offset="3729450">It alleged that Steward Mott desires to make independent expenditures on behalf of a candidate in excess of $1,000.00 and the other candidates who are plaintiffs, appellants here make allegations that they wish to have people make such expenditures on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.899" offset="3823595">Let me also address the question of the meaning of Section 610 in the segregated funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.228" offset="3868839">I must confess that we see vagueness there as else where and we are not able to endorse the Attorney General’s flat position that Unions and Corporations may spend unlimited amounts from segregated funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.194" offset="3952744">I do not think in any sense that even if it is read to mean that they must spend through six-month political committees, the statute still gives them relatively far more power than they had previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.562" offset="4022230">They are permitted, first under Pipe Fitters, the Unions and the Corporations clearly control the dispersal of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.190" offset="4056712">That is the explicit language of Mr. Justice Brennan’s decision, I believe it was, is that we hold, at page 384, we hold that such a fund must be separate from the sponsoring Union only in the sense that there must be strict segregation of its moneys from Union dues and assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.291" offset="4125153">And I take it that continues now, otherwise it would violate, if the Union or Corporation did not control the funds, it violate the probation on earmarking, so that they do control the funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1091.638" offset="4366524">There is three reasons why Unions and Corporations have great power under statute relative to other groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.483" offset="4397871">The first is that they can engage in unlimited spending to raise money for the segregated funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.825" offset="4419291">As far as we can tell from a statute they are permitted to spend as much as they want from their treasuries to raise money from a members, employees and stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.895" offset="4459520">Second they can spend unlimited funds to communicate with employee, members and stockholders and this alleged or is believed of great value because communications with those people necessarily reach large numbers of other voters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.190" offset="4528692">You say that Unions and Corporations have great power, but that by itself does not demonstrate that the statute is unconstitutional?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph K. Winter, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1139.635" offset="4558472">I think it does and it fits in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.477" offset="4565891">One, I think it is facial discrimination and a regulation of content.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.661" offset="4582609">Here we have almost exactly the situation faced by the Court in Mosley where there is a general probation on a certain kind of a speech with an exception made for labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.994" offset="4631928">Secondly, Justice Rehnquist, I think it shows beyond any question that there is no rational relationship between the ends that are used to justify the statute and the means employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.270" offset="4672993">This record, this appendix is thick with contributions by business and Union interests which the statute is alleged to diminish, whose influence the statute was supposed to stop and indeed the allegation is made over and over again, that the prime source of corruption or improper obligation comes from organized economic interest groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.797" offset="4767138">I think if we show that in fact under the statute and I think we shown, convincingly, that under the statute that those groups have more power relative -- relatively more power because of the limitation placed on other groups and the freedom left to them, I think we have shown its unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.881" offset="4843520">The third way in which they are made relatively more powerful is that the six-month political committee provision is really tailored to their use for purposes I have explained before and allows them to spend five times as much as other kinds of committees and individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.225" offset="4912797">There is nothing anywhere that I know off in the legislative history of the statute, suggesting in anyway that any justification for those provisions and that have to do with the asserted justifications for the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.439" offset="4973714">Now, reference has been made to the legislative history of the limits, I think when the Court addresses the legislative history or finds it, it is quite simple, they kept going down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.693" offset="5030766">From the original proposals, they got lower and lower and indeed we are in some disagreement with Mr. Cox’s description of the situation and I believe it was November, 1973 when common clause testified before Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.218" offset="5100774">I am reading from Mr. Gardner’s testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.229" offset="5112895">The bill passed by the Senate would allow candidates for the House to spend $90,000.00 in primary races and another $90,000.00 in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.833" offset="5151242">Some have advocated expenditure limits substantially lower than those contained in that Bill, 35, 000; 42,500; 50, 000 are among the figures which have been mentioned as preferable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.241" offset="5192934">Common clause considers that any substantial reduction of the figures in S-372 which was 90,000 in both elections, would virtually guarantee a permanent re-election of incumbent members of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.550" offset="5238178">Now, of course they did reduce the limits after that and in fact it would not adjust for inflation, the limits of the senate bill at that time were a $100,800.00 for each election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.793" offset="5279138">So there was a various substantial reduction after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.875" offset="5295438">The legislative history in the Senate, repeatedly, floor managers and the like in the Senate stated that the House could write their ticket to the Senate or not review what the House was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.887" offset="5371507">Now, I think it is clear in our brief what our objections to their statistical figures and in particular the comparison with the overall combined limit in that the statute in no way permits candidates to aggregate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.165" offset="5432633">You have to spend to influence a particular election and comparison -- comparing previous spending with an overall combine limit, comparing that with previous spending by candidates who had one serious race, simply does not make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.920" offset="5499611">I might also say, suppose it does not for a challengers, suppose it is as even handed, no one really denies that it is not going to affect the outcome of elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.820" offset="5543184">No one really plans that is not going to have an impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.224" offset="5552797">Indeed the whole reason was to reduce the amount of political speech in which people were engaging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.231" offset="5576829">That seems to me clearly the party will affect the outcome of elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.699" offset="5590727">It does not matter who is affected, it is still a First Amendment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.985" offset="5603892">The public will suffer because of this expose to less and less information, less and less the debate, the less participatory activities by volunteers and the like. Virtually, all the evils that have been suggested in this Court, in no real sense call for limitations on candidate expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.400" offset="5697515">The ones we have now because it costs so much to raise large contributions, really induce candidates to try and raise contributions in as high amount as they possibly can because they save that much on fund raising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.933" offset="5743700">Also, there is no reason certainly to limit campaigns, the amount campaigns can spend whether or not they are raising in a large contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.310" offset="5773166">This statute limits -- would have put limits on the campaign of a candidate like Ramsey Clark who has announced, who did announce that he would not spend over -- would not receive contributions over a $100.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.475" offset="5833874">Now, I have not heard anything today which would call for limits on expenditures, extraordinary spending provisions for state and national party committees, distinctions between kinds of committees which permit greater freedom to some than to others and indeed, I would think that if Congress was serious about what it was claiming it was doing or if it had sought and considered a far simpler law, it might have had a better solution, not just the better one but one more constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.244" offset="5972950">A law that restricted total contributions of individuals, to candidates or committees to say something like a total of $35,000.00 in an election year and adequate disclosure provisions for timely notice of large contributions, would prevent corruption, bring about a quality at least as much as the FECA and yet would not have the same stringent impact on challengers, to incumbents or other candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.308" offset="6077231">We do not say it is a constitutional, but of all the major constitutional issues in this Court, all but one, disappear with a law of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.165" offset="6112653">Nothing demonstrated in Congress or in the record here calls for either the complexities or the intrusiveness of the FECA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.917" offset="6139611">We filed this Amicus attack is for the extend of our challenge, but this complex network of intricate distinction is just wholly unrelated to the purposes of the statute and itself is a signal that more loopholes more, more inequalities are being created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.408" offset="6205544">I think that 608 (e) demonstrates the intrusiveness of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.257" offset="6233025">The idea that a law putting almost a flat ban on the purchase of political advertising by individuals, can be called a loophole-closing provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.893" offset="6275553">It is not only contrary to the major trust Court’s decisions for years, but demonstrates just how intrusive this statute is on the free political debate in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.694" offset="7726707">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.440" offset="7745724">Appellant’s position is; first, that any mechanism for direct federal funding of political parties and candidates is unconstitutional and second that the particular mechanism Congress has chosen, embraces a number of unconstitutional discriminations among particular candidates and parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.907" offset="7843527">With the Court’s indulgence, I will reverse the order of our briefs and discuss the second question first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.053" offset="7872157">I begin with Chapter 95 which provides for general election federal subsidies for some, but not all presidential candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.900" offset="7911549">The basic device of course is the distinction between major parties, which one more than 25% of the vote in the prior election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.529" offset="7946031">Minor parties which won between 5% and 25% and so called new parties which are they really are new or else are old won less than 5% at the prior election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.879" offset="7999425">Major party candidates are wholly relieved of the need to seek private contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.284" offset="8021055">They are furnished their entire expenditure limit $20 million at the outset of the campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.546" offset="8050103">Minor parties, if there are any which they would not be in 1976, receive a prorata share, dependent on the ratio of their prior vote to the average vote of the major parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.782" offset="8103079">New parties receive nothing, but if they win over 5% of the vote in the in the current election, they purportedly can receive post election funding, though we shall see that, that alleged entitlement is almost completely illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.416" offset="8161593">Independent candidates not identified with the party, receive nothing at any stage, no matter what their vote is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.333" offset="8201300">A most serious problem with this scheme is the treatment of new parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.079" offset="8220212">We think the 5% threshold first, although this is not the most serious objection, is too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.757" offset="8246962">It is much more onerous than the nominally similar threshold sustained for ballot access in Jeness versus Fortson because that scheme allowed petition signed by persons who at the prior election have voted for other parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.407" offset="8305580">Since this is clearly a prior vote qualification it requires that the member of the 5% not have voted for anyone else and not to stay at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.661" offset="8346540">The Jeness court relied heavily on the open aspects of the 5% that anyone could sign the petition even if he just voted in a primary two weeks before that for another party and in Jeness you upheld that 5% figure with strong intimations that were not for those open features not present here, 5% would be too high.</text>

            <text syncTime="2227.562" offset="8910158">The most egregious discrimination in Chapter 95 is that no way is provided for new parties to qualify by petition at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.110" offset="8944431">They are excluded entirely on the basis of prior vote performance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2275.655" offset="9102524">Indeed every one of the ballot access cases involved a petition alternative route to get on the ballot, instead of being limited or excluded on the basis of prior vote statistics.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.265" offset="9277022">Appellees have failed to suggest any reason whatever, like qualification for federal funds by a petition could not and should not have been incorporated in Chapter 95.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.563" offset="9322162">Such a readily available mechanism while solving all constitutional problems, would have provided a new party with some means to qualify.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.235" offset="9428846">Obviously, funds provided after the election is over are off no use whatever to a party in trying to win the election or to make the substantial impact on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.942" offset="9467716">Moreover, if that were enough, this theoretical entitlement to post election funding is rendered almost completely illusory by the provision that it can be used only to repay loans, which is what the statutes says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.106" offset="9528424">The result will be that only a tiny fraction of a new party’s expenditures, if any, will be reimbursable, even though the party otherwise qualifies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.533" offset="11190126">If a party of that sort makes a substantial impact in one election, then the usual consequence is that it goes on to higher things or else the other party is adjusted and it is absorbed back into one of the major parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.835" offset="11243311">But artificial preservation of third parties whose time has passed is an inevitable result of basing federal subsidies on prior election performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.765" offset="11279047">I must say something about Chapter 96, the matching grant provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.241" offset="11304960">The subsidy amount that candidates can receive under matching grounds is made wholly dependent on the private contributions that candidate has raised, that is it is a wealth criterion, similar to one you struck down in Bullock versus Carter and Lubin versus Panish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.917" offset="11375595">Surely what should matter is the number of contributors to or supporters of a candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.124" offset="11400464">Instead a single contributor can command the matching firms checked off by 250 of his fellow citizens on their tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.935" offset="11439647">The entire scheme rewards the candidate who gets into the race earliest, who can command the largest number of $250 contributors and who is supported by a special interests, which can easily help him meet the 20-state requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.001" offset="11499938">A candidate who comes in at the later stage, perhaps in response to some new development or some newly perceived political issue is heavily disadvantaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.655" offset="11542570">The provision is in fact working exactly in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.751" offset="11558975">That is demonstrated by the figures on page 52 of our reply brief, showing what the presidential candidates have raised to date and what they have on hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.860" offset="11599412">It is apparent from those figures that the great bulk of available federal funds is likely to go to only two of the twelve present candidates, Governor Wallace and Senator Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.249" offset="11648940">Most of the others even though have raised substantial private funds, have dissipated almost all of them before the campaign for votes even begins.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.132" offset="11752490">Most of these candidates will be so crippled for funds that whatever federal matching grounds they receive will not prevent them from being driven out of the race at very early stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.926" offset="11799615">This legislation has made money more important in campaigning than it was before, not less important as it allegedly was supposed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.489" offset="11837858">Those problems are compounded by the fact that the mechanism for dispersing the matching grounds is so fraught with uncertainty and so dependent on diaphanous prophesies that have to made long before they can be made, that the results maybe unfair or random in the extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.195" offset="11908702">We set out some of these problems at pages 70 through 73 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.592" offset="11930331">The day after that brief was filed, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, testifying before the Federal Election Commission, confirmed everyone of those concerns we had expressed and added some new ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.359" offset="11977352">We have lodged this testimony with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.573" offset="11990204">It is now clear after his testimony that funds maybe inadequate to pay all the candidates who qualify and that what funds are made available will depend on guesses as to what third parties may enter the ultimate general action campaign and what their election day performance might be, this in December or January and there is a distinct possibility that all the available funds will be exhausted by the first two candidates who qualify, Wallace and Jackson, thus discriminating against those who qualify thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.765" offset="12119040">Finally, the difficult decisions that must be made by a partisan political appointee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.857" offset="12143386">President Ford, the Secretary of the Treasury is going to decide how much money President Ford and Mr. Reagan get for the New Hampshire primary, that is a curious litigate for forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.064" offset="12192183">There are other discriminations that I have not even been able to touch on like the exclusion of appellant McCarthy solely on the ground that he is an independent rather than affiliated with a political party from any subsidies at any stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.755" offset="12254981">We think that some problems of this nature, whether the same ones or other ones will be present in any kind of Federal subsidy scheme that is formulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.616" offset="12294374">Any such scheme will establish some parties by favoring them over others, just as this scheme establishes the two existing major parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.878" offset="12335438">As Mr. Justice Douglas wrote in Abington School District versus Schempp, the most effective way to establish any institution is to finance it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.395" offset="12381518">Such political establishments, we think, cannot be squared with freedom of speech of association or with the general welfare or indeed with the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 which contemplate free elections in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.005" offset="12439928">Most of these objections would not apply to a genuine check off scheme, whereby each citizen would designate party or a candidate to receive the sum he checked off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.126" offset="12480470">There is nothing impractical about a scheme like that as we have shown in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.124" offset="12500428">If there is anyone for federal involvement in the campaign funding mechanism at all, such a method would plainly be less intrusive mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="3150.730" offset="12602828">Since Mr. Clagett has not invested much of his oral argument in his arguments as to the power of the Federal Government under the general welfare clause to provide for public financing of election campaigns and since he has not devoted much time to his argument that any such plan violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment which he moves by implication over into the free speech Section of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.871" offset="12735425">I shall concentrate, as he did, on the alleged discriminatory effects of this particular proposed public financing plan against the smaller parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.310" offset="12801149">I would like to first stress that the appellants show little proof of injury to them to support their claim that these provisions should be voided before they have had a chance to work in a single election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.833" offset="12867291">Of the twelve plaintiffs in this action, only four assert any interest in the public financing of presidential campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.294" offset="12905117">One is Eugene McCarthy whose claim is wholly academic as to discrimination because he has testified on deposition in this case, that he would have not accepted public financing even if he was eligible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3283.799" offset="13135099">The same is true of course of his party, his committee for a constitutional presidency which is a second plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.802" offset="13171148">The same is true of the Libertarian Party which testified on deposition that it would not accept public financing if offered and in the case of the fourth plaintiff, the Conservative Party of New York has never nominated a presidential candidate who was not also a candidate of the major party and thus entitled to the full allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.609" offset="13270413">And no other political party or any present aspirant for their 76 nominations is before you in this case, although the Socialist Workers Party has filed an amicus brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3473.026" offset="13892023">There are candidates like Governor Wallace in 1968 who got I believe something like 12 ½% to 13 ½ % of the total vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.255" offset="13929012">Indeed there are in the 36 elections, since 1832, defining small parties as parties coming on the scene for the first time or too small parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.256" offset="13980944">There are ten examples in that table I referred you to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3515.543" offset="14062132">The appellant’s focus on the 5% floor based on votes in the preceding election as a condition of pre-election financing and based on votes in the current election as a condition of post election financing as their principal claim of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.875" offset="14159412">And I would like to deal with that first from the standpoint of the floor itself and second as from the standpoint of the alleged discrimination between pre-election and post-election financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.079" offset="14216255">These provisions are attacked as showing a studied congressional disregard for the third parties, but to the contrary as the Court of Appeals found, that Congress took great care neither to favor nor to disfavor the smaller parties and it fixed on the 5% floor and the other objectively measurable features of this plan in a careful effort that it was found in belief that it was following the guidance of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.044" offset="14352091">The original public financing measures, you may recall was enacted in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.535" offset="14374139">It set a floor of 7% based entirely on results in the preceding election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.763" offset="14399007">Nothing whatever was provided based on results in the current election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.553" offset="14418129">That law was suspended by Congress the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.499" offset="14433907">In the next year, in 1968, you decided Williams against Rhodes and in 1971, you decided Jeness against Fortson and it was based on the guidelines provided by those two opinions that Congress in 1971, just a few months later enacted the fore runner of Chapter 95.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.168" offset="14532650">And, the 5% figure was taken directly as I said from Jeness, based on the holding that before providing access to the credit ballot, a state can reasonably require a showing of a significant modicum of support and that 5% was a reasonable flow for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.024" offset="14616033">And if you look at the report of the Senate Rules Committee, proposing that legislation, you will see it refers specifically to Jeness and to Williams against Rhodes that it specifically recognizes the constitutional right of a minor party to grow into a major political force and that it correctly, we believe said quoting Jeness, that it’s Bill did not freeze the political status quo.</text>

            <text syncTime="3846.698" offset="15386749">Appellants have argued that the 5% figure upheld in Jeness was less restrictive because it was a figure for a petition that could include voters who had voted for other candidates in the preceding election or who had signed other petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.572" offset="15462191">But the 5% in this floor may well be a less onerous requirement because it is 5% of a much smaller universe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.931" offset="15507644">It is 5% of the 60% or 70% of the electorate at votes which is something in the national scale of the order of 4 million people, rather than 5% of those registered as eligible to vote which must be well over 5 million because the number of eligible, when I say -- I will correct myself, not eligible to vote, registered to vote, because of the number of eligible voters in 1976 is estimated to be something of the order of 150 million people of whom or probably well over 100 million will actually be registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.343" offset="15677336">Appellants have not proven as the Court said in Jeness that one 5% goal as any significantly harder to reach than the other and it would seem to us that this one satisfies not only the test of Jeness, but also the test of Storer against Brown which also was 5% of the votes cast in the preceding election, although it was on petition basis, but the Court had trouble with that level in Storer against Brown not because it was 5% of the voters in the preceding election, but because excluded from that universe or any people who had voted in the primaries, something that does not happen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.633" offset="15874508">We would also say that even if Congress was constitutionally wrong in setting a 5% floor of votes as a condition for public financing that would not require the chapter to be invalidated in its entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.523" offset="15938038">When a statue discriminates unconstitutionally because of under inclusion, the Court need not declare that statue a nullity, but can extend the coverage of the statute to those who are grieved by the exclusion if that would better effectuate the legislative purpose and of course you did that last term in Weinberger against Wiesenfield in which you found it was unconstitutional to bar Social Security coverage for widowers while giving it to widows.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.392" offset="16061544">You did not declare it unconstitutional to pay widows, instead you took care of it on an under inclusion basis by saying that widowers also had to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.490" offset="16105953">Applying the same theory here, we say it would consist, that certainly be more consistent with the congressional intent rather than to strike down the entire public financing scheme to extend public financing on a proportional basis to parties or to candidates who garnered less than 5% of the votes in the preceding election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.064" offset="16212219">Next, the attack is on any floor based on results in the preceding election because it bars the candidates of parties falling below that floor as well as candidates of no parties or of new parties from receiving any public financing before the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.042" offset="16292153">They have not suggested anymore workable method of proving before an election and then a significant modicum of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.672" offset="16334681">The latest idea that Mr. Clagett has put forth signatures of 5% of the eligible voters on a petition, as in the case of Jeness, we would say is highly impractical and certainly whether or not Congress could have chosen that method.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.604" offset="16406361">One, it is entitled to have rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.365" offset="16421407">5% of the registered voters in Georgia was 88,000 voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.890" offset="16447530">5% of the registered voters in the United States as I indicated earlier is probably well over 5 million voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.781" offset="16479086">For a candidate to compile into the FEC election Commission have to verify some 5 million signatures, voters in 40 to 50 states raises enough questions about cost and feasibility and Jeness according to the stipulation in that case at page 87 on file of the Court, the cost to Georgia of verifying the 88,000 signatures was approximately a dollar for signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.142" offset="16604473">That cost was something like 75 to $80,000.00 for each of the two petitions that the Court has reasoned that Georgia had recently cleared in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.964" offset="16651807">Moreover, as the Court of Appeals found, the appellants have failed to show that the inability of those who fail the 5% test to obtain pre-election financing, disadvantages them in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4179.743" offset="16718890">Of course, pre-election money would be better than post election money, but even before the advent of major party financing -- of public financing I am sorry, the major party candidates were able to raise pre-election money to a vastly greater extent than the smaller party candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.127" offset="16808438">And Chapter 95 is not going to change that differential to the detriment of the smaller candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.286" offset="16837068">In 1972, the Republican candidate raise nearly $60 million privately, most of it before the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.836" offset="16867265">The Democratic candidate nearly $39 million privately, most of it before the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.695" offset="16894746">Even if you applied retroactively the rule of the new statute against contributions in excess of $1,000.00 and eliminated all of those excesses from the 1972 figures, each candidate raised well over $24 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.684" offset="16966635">All of the minor party, presidential candidates combined, raise approximately $1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.188" offset="17000699">1% of the 100 million that the major party candidates raised, if you ignore the $1,00.00 ceiling and 2% of what they raised if you apply the $1,00.00 ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.358" offset="17057332">So we would say to you that in 1976, at least if you look at the 1972 figures, the small party candidates and any no party candidates certainly are not going to be worse off vis-a-vis the major party candidates in terms of pre-election funding because of Chapter 95.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.803" offset="17135177">In fact, if you take into account, the ceilings on contributions and the ceilings on expenditures, it looks as if they would very likely be better off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.006" offset="17180003">And at the very least as the Court of Appeals agreed, they have not proven any real danger that they are going to be worse off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.568" offset="17222217">Next, I would like to come to Mr. Clagett’s point about the constitutionally required alternative means for pre-election financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.467" offset="17261819">Leaving aside the distinction between pre-election and post election financing, of course, an alternative means is provided in the statute because a party which does achieve the 5% level in the current election will receive post election money and I will get to Mr. Clagett’s ,point about the lone distinction in just a moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4498.879" offset="17995442">First, just as the Court in Jeness found that this was one of the alternative means there, an individual aspirant for the presidency, instead of competing for the nomination of a minor party or going it alone, could as plaintiff McCartney did in 1968, compete for the nomination of a major party and if he succeeds, he would have of course get the full entitlement of the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.569" offset="18098260">If he prefers the nomination of the minor non qualifying party, Chapter 95 permits its candidate as well as those who are entitled to some public financing, but less than the full allotment to continue to raise private contributions, while it requires those who qualify and except the full 20 million not to raise any private contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.974" offset="18199824">So that any small party or no party candidate will demonstrate sufficient strength, will be free to raise pre-election funds commensurate with that strength and as was noted a few moments ago, George Wallace did precisely that in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.304" offset="18269205">He raised almost $7 million which was 12 ½ % of what all presidential candidates raised at a time when he accounted for 13 ½% of the total presidential vote and certainly a lot of that strength was visible before the election and that is why he was able to raise the money.</text>

            <text syncTime="4738.472" offset="18953822">The answer to that as the Court of Appeals indicated is there is no definition of party in this portion of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="4777.818" offset="19111184">The voucher plan has a number of difficulties of which the most significant is the danger of block trading of vouchers, vouchers would be like money people could buy them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.863" offset="19159353">They would also be very high administrative cost in dealing with vouchers worth only $1 or $2 that cost in collecting those, might very well turn out to be more than what they would be worth in the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.526" offset="19218077">So far as the check off for a candidate of your choice is concerned, since the check offs are keyed to the four tax dates, it is not even clear on the last of those dates April 15, 1976 who the candidates are really going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.863" offset="19295399">Moreover, Congress wanted and I think, again this was a legitimate congressional purpose to have equal allotments of funds to any party that got over 25% in order as much as possible to balance things out for a two or three party race in the next election and a candidate of your choice check off provision could not be accommodated to that sort of a system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.417" offset="19409607">Lastly there is to matching suggestion which is not advocated by appellants because they object to matching on other grounds, but it is suggested by the Attorney General and matching, we submit suitable as it maybe for the primary period is wholly unsuitable for the regular election for the very same reason I have mentioned earlier, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, for legitimate interest of either the Federal Government of the State Government in trying to develop some kind of a majority choice at federal election.</text>

            <text syncTime="5568.283" offset="22273045">The Commission passed the rule which would to some slight modest extent had mitigated incumbent advantages, and therefore, benefited the appellants and Congress used the legislative veto on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5618.850" offset="22475337">It is made in legislative agency by several things, but essentially by two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.202" offset="22496758">First, the appointment powers, second, the legislative veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="5627.715" offset="22510759">In this particular instance it was the legislative veto that was the more conspicuous element of legislative control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.322" offset="22537195">This is not the only thing the Commission has done that hurts appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5637.681" offset="22550674">The advisory opinion, subjecting lawyers and accountant’s fees to the expenditure limits which came down about ten days ago I believe and which we have lodged with the Court, was as the two dissenting Commissioners said terribly hostile to the interest of new comers and challengers to the political scene, who have greater burdens in trying to figure out what this legislation means and to comply with it than incumbents do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.015" offset="22671987">This advisory opinion expressly injured challengers directly in that sense. Senator McCarthy, the Commission has tried to audit him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.342" offset="22717336">They have threatened him with the use of their civil enforcement power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.855" offset="22731337">They backed off a bit after this litigations terminated query whether they will continue backing off on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.193" offset="22756728">Certainly he believes that he is directly injured by attempts to audit him to find out the identity of his contributors down as low as $100.00 and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.811" offset="22811167">The disclosure regulations which there is just a notice so far and they have not been formerly adopted yet, the great burdensomeness of those of those regulations, what a number of observers have called the almost incredible complexity and the new conditions, the new requirements that the Commission is planning on top of the statutory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.166" offset="22892565">For example keeping photostats of every check which there is nothing about in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.163" offset="22912627">These similarly impact directly on appellant's to the extent that they have to file reports which they almost all of them do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.221" offset="22940839">They have filed them and they injure appellants certainly insofar as they are challengers and new comers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.609" offset="22978351">It emerges clearly from the statutory scheme that the law is to be administered and enforced primarily by the Commission itself through a whole spectrum of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.693" offset="23018684">Statements of general policy, both interpretative and substantive rule making, advisory opinions, entertaining complaints, conducting investigations and audits, holding hearings on complaints and undertaking conciliation procedures, that battery of powers and the overwhelming majority of cases should be sufficient to compel the compliance with the Commission's view of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.412" offset="23117636">Resort to a civil enforcement proceeding or they are brought by the Commission itself or by the Attorney General at its direction should rarely be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.118" offset="23156402">The bulk of these powers have already been exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.551" offset="23166119">The Commission has made rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="5799.928" offset="23199660">It has also investigated complaints, and conducted audits and it has we are informed, procured compliance with its views, through conciliations proceedings in at least 50 cases so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.265" offset="23248980">Those proceedings are secret, so they are not announced to the public, but were told there have been at least 50 of it that have been brought to conclusion so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.733" offset="23282834">The Commission is even exercised the power of which the Commission’s counsel tells you, the Commission does possess, that is the power to issue rules governing both the meaning and the administration of the expenditure and contribution limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="6868.501" offset="27473920">There is no question that the power -- that the federal power -- congressional power over elections is very broad, but it is a legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6877.183" offset="27508715">It is to be exercised by a law and there is all the difference in the world between saying that the Congress can legislate broadly on the subject on one hand and saying that it can retain to itself the enforcement within the administration power.</text>

            <text syncTime="6959.161" offset="27836604">He would like to point out that it is Section 9038 (b) (3) which deals with matter of unexpanded primary matching funds and it does require that they be returned.</text>

            <text syncTime="6986.792" offset="27947154">And we do think as Justice Rehnquist’s questions have highlighted that there is a question of standing with respect to this part of the case which does lie at the threshold and does have to be addressed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7004.332" offset="28017267">By and large appellants accept the view that if this Commission had been appointed, all of its members by the President, that it would be able to exercise the powers that have been accorded it.</text>

            <text syncTime="7030.893" offset="28123533">He did Your Honor, but I think at least the fundamental objection to this Commission’s legitimacy is they put it into it having particular powers and I shall come to this veto, legislative veto point also.</text>
            <text syncTime="7044.510" offset="28177972">I think their fundamental concern is the claim that this violates the President’s constitutional prerogatives to appoint officers of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7055.612" offset="28222380">And our point as to that is that it is hard to see how appellants have standing to act here as the President’s champion because this is a question which goes solely to the allocation of the appointed power within the federal establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7073.998" offset="28295941">There is no question here, that all of these commissioners meet the statutory qualifications and when Mr. Clagett says that Commission is engaging in various forms of regulation it does not seem to us that supports an attack upon the legitimacy of the Commission because the allocation of the appointive power is between the President and the Congress is not designed for the protection of the public at large or taxpayers or of citizens and of course there is remedy here.</text>

            <text syncTime="7332.829" offset="29331226">The first proposition is that Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2, the Section of the constitution dealing with the appointment power is not preclusive of congressional authority to make appointments to offices where it appears that the function of those officers is substantially related to a constitutional responsibility of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7367.336" offset="29469257">The second proposition we hope to develop is that the Congress has unique and pervasive responsibilities which are not confined solely to passage of legislation in relation to the federal electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="7389.277" offset="29557029">And that leads us to the third proposition, that the powers which have been accorded to this Commission that an examination of them shows that they are substantially related or incidental to those constitutional responsibilities of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7411.430" offset="29645636">It is true of course that Article 2 does provide for appointment of officers of the United States by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="7420.313" offset="29681162">It then does go on, however, in the but clause with which Your Honors are familiar to state that Congress made by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the President alone in the Courts of law or in the heads of departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="7440.480" offset="29761829">And we think it is fairly implicit in that Section, at least when it is read in the light of constitutional history and practice and the number of decisions of this Court that though Congress is not expressly granted the same power --</text>
