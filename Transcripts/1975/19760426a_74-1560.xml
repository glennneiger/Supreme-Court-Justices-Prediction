            <text syncTime="29.356" offset="221967">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.491" offset="246522">The case of Rodolfo Sifuentes in which I am court appointed counsel involved the question of whether the border patrol can stop a vehicle at a permanent checkpoint many miles from the border for the purposes of interrogating its occupant and visually searching the interior of the vehicle without cause or suspicion of any kind and also without a warrant of any nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.402" offset="378179">Now the Martinez-Fuerte case involves the same question except in that case the checkpoint was operating under some nature of a warrant, a warrant of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.078" offset="444844">However, the government may intend that they have a right to operate these checkpoints to make these stops and inflict these intrusions upon the people passing without a warrant and the fact that they did have a warrant or did not have a warrant is not controlling and that is their initial argument anyway.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ballard Bennett</label>

            <text syncTime="126.290" offset="609729">My checkpoint was approximately 70 miles from the border and as I recall and the checkpoint that I have in my case is near Sarita, Texas and you probably do not know where Sarita, Texas is but it is in the Ranch country of South of Houston between Houston and Brownsville.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.150" offset="697187">The San Clemente checkpoint is about 65 five miles from the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.358" offset="717980">In between both the checkpoint and the border in both of those areas there large metropolitan establishment of course they have got San Diego and California and then the Lower Rio Grande Valley which what they call this are.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.842" offset="787988">We have a strain of towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.165" offset="801258">I believe we have got about 320,000 people that live in this area between the border itself and the checkpoint.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ballard Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="186.903" offset="852145">Your Honor, I would guess Brownville to be about 80,000 people.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="190.951" offset="868341">And that is south of the checkpoint here in your case?</text>

          <turn speaker="ballard_bennett" startTime="192.615" stopTime="277.588">
            <label>Mr. Ballard Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="192.615" offset="875028">Yes sir, it certainly is.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.953" offset="884432">The Highway 77 on which the checkpoint is located originates in Brownville.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.569" offset="906898">It goes from Brownsville through San Benito, through Harlingen, through Raymondville.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.446" offset="930408">Now, the rest of the other valley cities are off back to the west and the roads constantly feed into this Highway 77.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.240" offset="969487">Now when it gets to Raymondville, a few miles outside then it hits the Ranch country and the valley is not really a valley, it is an alluvial belt and they have a very great deal of agriculture, it is highly intense cultivation of raw crops.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.563" offset="1062796">But when you get in to this country where they have the checkpoint located, it is in the Ranch country.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.566" offset="1086829">The King Ranch is on both sides, but it is not right there where the checkpoint is but the King Ranch is broken up into various divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.484" offset="1126535">And, there is one -- several divisions to the north and there is at least one or two to the south. And, it is in a remote area.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.468" offset="1162480">Now, the valley is like a three-neck bottle and I am speaking of course of the Rio Grande Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.714" offset="1191423">There are only three ways to get out of there by automobile going north.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="277.588" offset="1214934">When you speak of the Valley Mr. Bennett, how far up the Rio Grande does it go?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ballard_bennett" startTime="283.037" stopTime="316.215">
            <label>Mr. Ballard Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="283.037" offset="1236772">Well, the area that I am talking about, this area where they have a lot of farming and a lot of people about 320,000 or so, it consist generally of four counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.481" offset="1302496">Three counties starting down at the mouth of the Rio Grande and going up northwest, the river runs in a northwest direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.721" offset="1335410">There would be three counties running along there and then one county sits on top of Cameron County, which is right at the coast.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="316.215" stopTime="317.967">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="316.215" offset="1369474">To the north of those.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ballard_bennett" startTime="317.967" stopTime="435.417">
            <label>Mr. Ballard Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="317.967" offset="1376475">North of there.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.964" offset="1380445">Now Highway 77 runs through Cameron County, it runs through Kennedy County, excuse me; one is at Willacy County which is the next county up.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.695" offset="1419316">And then, it goes on up into Kennedy County and this checkpoint is about 8/10 of the way up into Kennedy County.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.978" offset="1448468">Kennedy County is a huge county it has got about 1500 square miles in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.196" offset="1469366">So, there is really no connection between this checkpoint and the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.468" offset="1506460">The traffic coming by there comes out of the valley and there is no assurance or whatsoever that any of these cars have recently come across the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.074" offset="1572916">We maintain that there is no substantial extension between that stop by roving patrol and it stop at a checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.744" offset="1619518">We feel that the reasoning of the Brignoni-Ponce case should be controlling and should be extended to the checkpoint stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.658" offset="1671241">It is our contention that these intrusions can be characterized and it is sort of a three-pronged attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.963" offset="1708439">First there would be the stop itself, now, at Sarita, every car coming down that road except people containing the local inhabitants are stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.045" offset="1760788">Now, whether you call that taking a man to custody, a short of traditional arrest, or whether you call it a seizure or however you characterize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.444" offset="1806346">The fact remains that once you come within the site of that checkpoint then you were in the custody of the border patrol agent on duty.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="435.417" offset="1846261">You are stopped and then what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="436.907" offset="1852217">Then each car stopped except those whose occupants are recognized as local residents.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.244" offset="1881578">The first thing that happens is the agent approaches close enough to the car to be able to see down in that car.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.531" offset="1950646">Now, this interrogation is open ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.884" offset="1964125">It can be simply “are you all United States citizens?”</text>
            <text syncTime="468.743" offset="1979590">“Yes, we are all United States citizens” or there is no regulations, it is completely in the discretions of the border patrol officer and he can ask you why, you say you are United States citizen, “where were you born?”</text>
            <text syncTime="483.044" offset="2036746">“Well, I was born in so and so.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.382" offset="5938081">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.949" offset="5952396">These consolidated cases involve four separate prosecutions in addition to the one involving Mr. Sifuentes involving a stop at the Sarita checkpoint in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.761" offset="5995655">There were three separate cases growing out of three stops at the San Clemente checkpoint which is the same checkpoint that was involved in last year’s Ortiz decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.712" offset="6035466">Like the Sarita checkpoint the San Clemente checkpoint is 60 or more miles from the -- air miles from the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.622" offset="6063051">The San Clemente checkpoint as you will probably recall as on interstate five between San Diego and Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.405" offset="6086143">Each of them is operated essentially around the clock except where weather or manpower prohibits or in the case of San Clemente if the traffic gets too heavy to be controlled protectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.031" offset="6140687">And, in each of the cases here each of the four cases, illegal aliens were discovered riding in the passenger compartment of the vehicles that were stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.950" offset="6176423">In one of the cases involved from the San Clemente checkpoint, the officers after discovering the illegal aliens in the passenger compartment searched the trunk of the automobile and found additional aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.372" offset="6230026">The broad issue in all four of these cases is whether border patrol officers may lawfully stop north bound vehicles at a fix checkpoint in the border area for the limited purpose of inquiring about the citizenship and immigration status of the visible occupants in the absence of an articulated reasonable suspicion that the cars carrying aliens who maybe illegally in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.005" offset="6324589">The Texas case and the California case is different two respects, first with respect to operating procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.280" offset="6353742">The Sarita checkpoint as Mr. Bennett mentioned is customarily operated by stopping for this limited inquiry almost everyone who passes with the exception of local residents or other persons who the officer recognizes, and those persons are simply waived through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.579" offset="6422914">At San Clemente by contrast a very small proportion of these passing vehicles were actually stopped for inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.116" offset="6461053">The figures at the time of the hearing and the Parker (ph) case which you remember was a consolidated proceeding in the Southern District of California concerning all the checkpoints there, estimated that roughly 3% of the vehicles then were being stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.402" offset="6534196">The current figures including the figures under the warrant that I will mention in a moment during the period that is involved here San Clemente indicated the percentage was even smaller perhaps one-half of one percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.273" offset="6581634">At San Clemente unlike the other checkpoints in the border patrol’s network, the point officer that is the officer who stands observing traffic as it approaches does not ordinarily question the occupants of the vehicle because of the heavy traffic when a vehicle is to be stopped for inquiry as referred off the highway to a secondary area where other officers make the inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.789" offset="6683721">Sarita, like most of the checkpoints aside from San Clemente as operated differently, the officers on the point generally makes the stop, and ask any questions that he wants to ask right in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.566" offset="6738787">And the only time a person is referred over to side of the highway is if the suspicious circumstances warrant further inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.810" offset="6771805">The other difference aside from operating procedure is that the stops at San Clemente were authorized by a warrant issued by a federal magistrate upon showing of area type probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.306" offset="6817781">There is no warrant for the stops at the Sarita checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.719" offset="6835440">In our view, these differences between the two checkpoints should not produce different results but they do account for somewhat different arguments addressed to the two checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.654" offset="6883192">The analytical framework for these cases, we think is drawn from this Court’s decision last time in Brignoni-ponce which also involved border patrol stops for inquiry but which involves stops on roving patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.123" offset="6937108">I think it is fair to say that all the parties agree that a checkpoint stop and an inquiry procedure is although a seizure under the Forth Amendment something like a street encounter involving a brief detention, shorter traditional arrest and that is therefore to be tested under the general reasonableness requirement of the Forth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.407" offset="7370218">This is what left and it is we think, at once the single most important aspect of the traffic checking program and also but far the least intrusive aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.219" offset="7425494">In our view the Court’s analysis leads to a different result in this case because as I just indicated I think the stops involved in a checkpoint stopping and inquiry procedure is substantially less intrusive and substantially more essential to the effective control of illegal immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.135" offset="7501144">As, we read the decision in Brignoni-Ponce, the decision turned essentially on two controlling considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.692" offset="7531342">First the court perceive that the roving patrol authority sought, it would permit border patrol officers to engage in unlimited stops anywhere within a one hundred mile zone anywhere within a zone 100 miles from the Mexican border which itself is 2,000 miles long; day or night on city streets, dessert roads, and busy highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.588" offset="7626950">Every motorist anywhere within the zone would be potentially a subject to limitless interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.943" offset="7656312">Second, the court can put it in the nature of the illegal alien traffic was such that it tends to generate articulable grounds for identifying violators and that the requirement of reasonable suspicion for roving patrol stops will allow the government an adequate opportunity to carry out its objective of protecting the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.726" offset="7739485">The Court in short and so stated, was not convinced that the legitimate needs of law enforcement required the degree of interference with lawful traffic that we believe would be the occasion by the authority that is sought in Brignoni-Ponce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.813" offset="7791835">Well, neither of these considerations is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.824" offset="7803851">The authority sought for checkpoint officers would give them no roving mandate to move about this zone of one hundred miles from the border to stop any car that they happen to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.187" offset="7853275">Strategically, each of the checkpoints is located at -- first of all it is a fixed location, it is not ordinarily mobile some of them do move from one to another location but essentially the same road and not -- there is no roving aspect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.221" offset="7913461">The officer has no discretion on its own to decide where cars to be stopped or (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.447" offset="7938329">There is no authority to pursue a car except one that goes through a checkpoint without stopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.758" offset="7959645">There is no interference here with city traffic, there is very little interference with community traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.948" offset="7980334">Each of this checkpoints is placed strategically almost by a self-limiting process in a place where the least amount of interference with local traffic would be required in order to check what the border patrol considers to be an essential route to ensure that no -- to try to ensure that none of the passing cars contain aliens who do not belonging the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="2092.900" offset="8476138">In short on this question of the scope of the discretion given the officers to initiate encounters, the degree of the potential interference with lawful traffic that would be occasioned by permitting these stops at checkpoints is substantially reduced over that, that the court thought would be involved in roving patrol situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.597" offset="8574986">It is true that the officer would retain discretion at the checkpoint particularly at checkpoints where the traffic is heavy as at San Clemente to select certain cars for the inquiry but there is no discretion as there was in Ortiz to select cars for search randomly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.228" offset="8645516">Of course a car could be searched if probable cause developed but there is no authority claimed here to make that kind of invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.444" offset="8674356">There is in effect no substantial invasion of privacy which is what the Court referred to in Ortiz is being involved in a search of a vehicle’s trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.996" offset="8720540">Brignoni recognized that the intrusion occasioned by a stop and inquiry is minimal, it is modest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.668" offset="8747289">What was significant in Brignoni was the extent of the potential interference of the lawful traffic and not the nature of the intrusion which is not trivial, it is certainly very limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.419" offset="8794205">Moreover, I should mention although I do not know if this is necessarily controlling but it adds to the nature of the kind of interference that is involved that I think most people would feel somewhat less frightened or less concerned about stopping at a regular checkpoint where their floodlights have slipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.019" offset="8868602">It is on a -- usually on a fairly large highway, there are other people traveling through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.395" offset="8886156">There is no one is being pulled over to the side of the road by a flashing red light from behind with the siren.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.814" offset="8911861">And, to a certain extent I think that minimizes the -- it might otherwise be viewed to some peoples as the offensive aspect of the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.512" offset="8942581">But even more important in our view is not the intrusiveness which we think -- I think it is incontestable as relatively slight but the controlling consideration in our view is that the checkpoint officer unlike a roving patrol officer simply is seldom in a position because of the nature of the operation to observe a vehicle for a long enough period or close enough before a stop to see suspicious signs suggesting illegal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.920" offset="9052295">A roving patrol officer can follow a vehicle for as long as he believed is necessary or to determine whether to make a stop on the basis of articulated suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.659" offset="9099211">But a checkpoint officer has only a brief second or two look at an oncoming car and the decision simply cannot, in most instances, be made that there something is suspicious about the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.267" offset="9137663">And I should mention, I think it is quite significant that our California respondents concede this in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.537" offset="9158770">They say that in a second or two available to an officer it is not likely that he will be able to find anything about a car that would rise the a level of reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.584" offset="9206940">Now, at most of these checkpoints, as I have mentioned, the stops are made on everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.037" offset="9228674">At San Clemente there is a very strong effort to avoid interference with the many thousand of cars that pass through the checkpoint and the effort is made there to select out those who seem to be somehow well worthy of -- excuse me -- of further inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2369.871" offset="9584044">I do not think -- the record shows in the Baca case that that is not a controlling consideration in any case but I think it would the front common sense to say that – if they are looking for illegal Mexican aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.877" offset="9628034">They should ignore the facial features of the occupants of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.814" offset="9647783">But the effort is made to separate out the ones, in their experience, lead them to think maybe there is something wrong with that car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.110" offset="9681010">Sometimes it is articulable sometimes may not be, I suspected the most instances if they were force to articulate, they can articulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.705" offset="9707342">But first of all I am not sure that would rise to the level of reasonable suspicion, certainly it would not rise the level of reasonable suspicion as the Ninth Circuit has interpreted that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.041" offset="9740778">And there is a sense, I suppose, there is a certain amount of sixth sense that the officers claim to be exercising that they can just tell but they can just tell but they can not tell why they referred all this, it is part of we are wanted further inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.837" offset="9791874">And, I think it also should be said that although that randomness is placed less a part of these checkpoints just because of the volume traffic and there is a sense that there ought to be some risk to any even in the most well disguised operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.418" offset="9850284">There ought to be some risk of apprehension and detection there and to a certain extent I suppose there is a certain amount of randomness that goes into the stops and particularly if the traffic is light then they stop a higher proportion of the cars and even though they might not believe that the particular car they are stopping is suspicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.479" offset="9926457">Now at the other checkpoints as I have said the practice has been stopped virtually all the cars that come by are baring a little bit with the traffic and as I have said that anybody is recognizable as a local resident or someone who eventually travels the area is obviously not going to be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.551" offset="10002734">The point is that because of the nature of the checkpoint operation is just not, this is not a situation like it was in Brignoni, this is -- if a reasonable suspicion requirement is imposed on checkpoint stops, it means that the government will not have an adequate ability to enforce the law at this checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.544" offset="10078698">They will not be able to carry out the responsibilities and protect the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.718" offset="10095417">And I think then the lightly consequence of a reasonable suspicion requirement would be that the checkpoints will have to be closed out because they simply could not be operated in any effective way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.279" offset="10133660">Now, one of the amicus brief suggest that the border patrol has not tried to using spotter vehicles on either side or spotters of some sort to alert checkpoint officer if something suspicious maybe coming up but I really wonder if that is less intrusive, I mean if you can picture a line of border patrol vehicles waiting a mile down the road from the checkpoint and falling into place behind each approaching vehicle and looking at it and seeing whether suspicious then alerting the officer to stop it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.253" offset="10253614">It is seems to me that is much more intrusive than a brief stop with a question or two about the citizenship of the occupants than the risk to have a car riding along side of you for a mile, I think that would offend most people a lot more than a stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.673" offset="10303247">And, what is the magic of a stop, I do not know what it is, the ninth circuit has held itself but in opinion that I believe Judge Hufstedler (ph) that was on the panel that diverting a car slowing it down to a short for – to a slow speed is not a constitutional violation of any sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="2966.757" offset="11971636">Well, second reason why we think warrants would be unnecessary in the context of a checkpoint stops is that the stationary nature and regularized procedure of the operation makes it in a sense unnecessary to have repeated renewals of warrants for one particular checkpoint, which is the procedure that was followed for sometime at San Clemente and many other checkpoints in the Ninth Circuit after the Ninth Circuit rule that we cannot operate them without warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.025" offset="12084694">Unlike a roving patrol which in case I assume would be essentially unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.649" offset="12107159">A checkpoint does not change substantially from day to day even from year to year and in our view judicial scrutiny can most appropriately awake on occasion an adversary criminal proceeding where the reasonableness of its operation can be determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.051" offset="12164733">And once determined one way or the other, there is an opportunity for appeal by the either side and that is the ultimate resolution of that checkpoint would stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.164" offset="12201200">I mean that would be the end of anything you know that checkpoint was reasonable without concluding other people from challenging it or you would know that it was unreasonable in which case the government would have no choice but to close it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.621" offset="12247071">But it is a single spot it is not a unique special situation requiring the advance approval of a judge because each time it becomes the judge for approval, and the judge says (Inaudible) this last week, no reason to go through this all again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.357" offset="12306003">I think that minimizes at least the need for a warrant of the kind that Mr. Justice Powell suggested in the concurring opinion on Almeida-Sanchez.</text>

            <text syncTime="3083.532" offset="12438705">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.421" offset="12462215">Moreover the warrant procedure in the context of the checkpoints we think has substantial problems of workability, and again in this very central aspect of our case I think the California respondents -- although they are not -- well the California respondents in effect concede that the beyond workable or at least it would be very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.577" offset="12546852">They say there is a price to be paid but I think it enters into the question whether indeed it should be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.467" offset="12570467">First of all there is a problem of coordination, all of these checkpoints are -- almost all of these checkpoints are correlated with others that are nearby as I was responding to Mr. Justice Marshall before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.640" offset="12607143">A checkpoint does not stand on its own it is coordinated with other checkpoints in the area so that there is no easy way for a personal intent on violating the immigration laws of avoiding detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.920" offset="12652282">It does not always work but that is the aim and if one magistrate says the checkpoint A is okay but the other Magistrate says checkpoint B is no good well that is just like having no checkpoint at all because everybody is going to up where checkpoint B is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.728" offset="12707453">The second thing is the need for flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.829" offset="12719887">The checkpoints we have here do not face this problem because these are permanent checkpoint in a sense they are operated roughly around the clock all of year and there is no question about their operation except where weather is bad or manpower is short.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.993" offset="12776521">But there are other checkpoints that can not be operated all the time or there is no need to operate them all the time and experience has shown that border patrol agents, the supervisory officials need just have that flexibility to establish a checkpoint that perhaps has not been used regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.673" offset="12855306">But the effect of the warrant requirement because you have to know well in advance whether you are going to use it, maybe to limit the use of checkpoints only the major ones which would in a long run serve very little purpose because the secondary routes would then become flooded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.658" offset="12915178">And third, I think I mentioned just a second ago in this context, there is no established procedure for appellant review over a denial of a warrant and the government would have little recourse if a magistrate or judge refused to grant a warrant and that happened to us during the period of the warrant procedure in the ninth circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.755" offset="12987590">We had several warrants denied and we were unable to do anything about the checkpoint have to be shut down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.920" offset="13016220">Of course if the ruling would occur in an adversary proceeding there will be no question about review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.644" offset="13051120">Well, if we are wrong about the need for a warrant and we need one that would affect only the Texas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.121" offset="13085079">We can only operate these checkpoints with warrants the Texas case is looser but the San Clemente stops were authorized in advanced by a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.967" offset="13120396">Precisely I think of the sort that was envisioned by Mr. Justice Powell’s concurring opinion on Almeida Sanchez.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.984" offset="13144534">We think it was superfluous, but there was a prior judicial approval of the very operation that led to the stops and inquiries and subsequent arrest in these cases in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.192" offset="13189360">And, we think this represents an additional basis for concluding the stops here was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.723" offset="13215482">The Court of Appeals on the Ninth Circuit in this case and our California respondents would give the warrant no weight because in their view it is unlawfully broad, but their argument has that kind of catch-22 flavor about it because they argue on the one hand that you need reasonable suspicion to make a stop and if you do not have reasonable suspicion then it sis essential that you have a warrant?</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.091" offset="13300955">But then they say, in order to get a warrant you have to have probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.210" offset="13317464">What this is really saying I think is as the Court stated in Wyman against James, a warrant is just out of place here but if we have lost that point the warrant is in place here, this is the only kind of warrant that can be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.805" offset="13371799">It requires an analysis and a weighing of the basic agency decision to conduct the checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.737" offset="13395518">Now, Mr. Justice Powell’s suggestion in this concurring opinion on Almeida-Sanchez was for a warrant that would authorize roving patrol searches over a precisely the kind of area that was involved in Brignoni-Ponce although a magistrate would in advance limit the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.226" offset="13465526">And the four dissenting justices although disagreeing as to the need for the warrant agreed that would be consistent with Fourth Amendment requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.916" offset="13496246">This warrant is substantially more limited authorizing only stops and not searches and limited only to a specific location and not to any roving extended aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.063" offset="13548805">It is true that the focus of a warrant of this sort is necessarily less precise than it would be the case for more conventional crime but the special problems of enforcement in this respect is they are detailed to Mr. Justice Powell’s concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.712" offset="13607423">We think justifies an unconventional solution and in this context I think we can, one can say that a warrant is sufficiently precise if it identifies the place where the operation is to take place, remembering it all times here that we are talking about stops and brief inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.647" offset="13679208">That it identifies the purpose and the scope of the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.514" offset="13694672">And then, it is narrowly as it is feasible it limits the class of vehicles to be subjected to it in this case, the class of northbound vehicles in interstate state five which is not a very narrow class, but it is as narrow as it is feasible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3754.190" offset="15121376">First, I think a brief statement as to what happens at the checkpoint again is in order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3763.648" offset="15159201">I think if one looks at the photograph provided by the government in the reply brief to Ortiz you can see what the on coming traffic faces at the San Clemente checkpoint that is two armed law enforcement officers standing in the middle of the highway in front of stop sign which says clearly stop and overhead there are two additional signs saying stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.730" offset="15251466">This is what is called the primary stop, what the Baca Court said was the fleeting stop and it is this where the officer without any guideline regulation or rule makes a decision whether or not he is going to let that individual whom he stopped and cease momentarily pass on his passage northward or to be referred to the secondary area for the interrogation as to the right of the individuals to be in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4394.098" offset="17680958">For one thing in the Baca hearing, and as you will see in our brief there are only 30 people, 30 border patrol man on a typical day shift covering the entire California Mexican border.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.476" offset="17722441">30 people for about a 125 to a 140 miles of border.</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.952" offset="17736338">That is an impossible situation they have not got enough man to respond to their sensor alerts on the border.</text>

            <text syncTime="4429.416" offset="17822228">And of course the major deterrent even as the border patrol officials can see the major deterrent is going to be the pass legislation to cut off the magnet for the illegal alien entering this country, and that is employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.531" offset="17866741">In this Court cannot legislate that legislation, it has to come from Congress, and if they are concerned about the problem enough to solve it, I do not think that we should dilute the protections of the Fourth Amendment to solve a law enforcement problem which congress has control over but has not deemed fit at this point at least to try to solve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.339" offset="17941974">And, I think unless they go to that alternative we should not take the lowest constitutional role to solve the problem as Justice, Judge Oaks has said in the Second Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="4488.633" offset="18059107">The other ones are one line opinion saying it appears reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.720" offset="18075407">The stop is not reasonable without a factual predicate giving the officers a reasonable suspicion to believe that illegal activity as a flit and that is the language directly out of Terry versus Ohio where reasonable was defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.094" offset="18132981">The only way that we can take the factual predicate away is if we are in a purely administrative atmosphere such as Cameron this Court held in Almeida-Sanchez that the administrative analogy does not apply and it does not apply here either where in the same situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4583.092" offset="18436942">That of course came about with border patrol powers in full flower, it is an ineffective deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.195" offset="18473304">They can get through -- San Clemente for example is only open 70% of the time and 95% of the alien traversing through that checkpoint get through.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.821" offset="18507890">It is, San Clemente is in effective deterrent as are all border patrol checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.532" offset="18534744">And the other point, the irony of this case is the Brignoni-Ponce involved the same area the San Clemente checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.565" offset="18562852">In that case, rather than standing in the middle of the highway the officer of course proceeded in a car perpendicular to the roadway saw Mr. Brignoni, and thought he was a Mexican looking individual pulled out and stopped him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.845" offset="18615933">The only difference in this case is that the officer who is standing in the middle of the road and I cannot believe that that difference is of constitutional significance when people’s right through at stake and especially when the discretion which is unbridled at this point for a point officer to decide to take people off the road is so subject to possible abuse because we are dealing with sensitive factors such as the racial appearance of an individual and in Southern California we have a substantial Mexican American population who are validly residing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.610" offset="18751038">For the government to say well the point officer only stops or lets through the local inhabitant, it is unrealistic to believe that a point officer is going to know the 1.5 million residents who are in southern -- south of the San Clemente checkpoint.</text>

            <text syncTime="4701.744" offset="18911534">No but that is certainly something for a Congress to act upon if they want to solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.246" offset="18929507">If the government considers it as a problem as I said before it seems to me that they should be acting upon it rather than the government attorneys coming to the courts to ask for a dilution of traditional Fourth Amendment protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.250" offset="18977572">And if I might say something about the warrants as my time is just about out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4722.365" offset="18994081">This is a warrant perhaps not against the entire American nation but it is a warrant against the entire population of Southern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.601" offset="19023025">The warrant was unlimited, it was perpetual, it did not even attempt to meet Justice Powell’s four factors in Almeida-Sanchez for the functional equivalent of probable cause, because it could not, 99.9 % of the vehicles, not the people but vehicles going to the San Clemente checkpoint contains no aliens at all, no illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.032" offset="19104736">And of course the figure would be higher for the number of people traversing that checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.833" offset="19123858">That in no way could be deemed the functional equivalent or probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4760.002" offset="19144547">Second, there is no nexus to the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.430" offset="19154264">There is, if we are talking about the equation for functional equivalency which was not even attempted to be met in this warrant, there is no nexus to the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.888" offset="19188119">66 miles from the border, and as we point out in our brief, we attached a little appendix here to show where the border is at the bottom and some 66 miles north of the border up near the San Clemente area is the checkpoint along I5 the major route north for Southern Californians and it is above some 19 major communities including San Diego and ocean side.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.559" offset="19302849">So, this warrant as the court below indicated does not even approach to Justice Powell’s criteria, the magistrate merely concluded there was cause to believe that massive immigration violation were taking place without even citing a particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.561" offset="19370767">He just said, there was probable cause to believe that violations of Title VII were taking place, and we say, consider a warrant which indicated that there was probable cause to believe that Title 18 violations were taking place in an area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.571" offset="19430849">It is much too wide it is not the type of warrant that is near for a location, near the border to be form as a stop gap for areas where there is no border patrol port of entry where people can be checked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.538" offset="19490721">In our brief we do include the alternative because the government pitches its case on the need -- we point out that there are numerous alternatives the border patrol has about ten other programs other than traffic checking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.724" offset="19543489">They include farm and ranch checking, airport terminal checking, industrial checking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.737" offset="19563551">I might -- we point out in our brief that in 20 dyas in Los Angeles the border patrol captured 12,000 illegal aliens in 20 days, 70 agents in a 20-day working period captured 12,000 in Los Angeles area just walking along the street and asking for their identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.646" offset="19635126">That is a much more efficient way of doing things than stopping the ingress of the entire Southern California population into the Los Angeles area and points northward.</text>

            <text syncTime="4919.573" offset="19782875">If someone is walking along the street and they simply asked a question, as long there is no seizure according to I think it was Justice White in Terry versus Ohio there is probably no problem, we are just asking the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="4948.181" offset="19897291">I will make it brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.854" offset="19900008">It is quite misleading to say that 99.9% of the vehicles are contained no aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.434" offset="19922264">99.8% of them are not referred over for -- about 99% of them are not referred over for secondary inspection, of those that are the figures under the warrant at issue here show that 21% were in fact found with illegal aliens in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.647" offset="19987152">Mr. Chief Justice on the status of the legislation what used to be H.R. 982, and the House has now been made up into a clean bill called H.R. 8713 which was reported to the House by the Judiciary Committee on September 24, 1975 in its report number 94-506.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.373" offset="20074088">The Senate has been one of the stumbling blocks in this legislation in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.470" offset="20094463">Senator Eastland, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has recently introduced own version of the bill, it is S3074 which, at Section 12 and 13, make it unlawful to knowingly employ illegal aliens, although the bill, as submitted by Senator Eastland, does not have criminal penalties it has a civil penalties structure.</text>
