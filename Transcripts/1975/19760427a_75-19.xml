            <text syncTime="51.614" offset="311232">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.243" offset="325756">This case presents the question whether police can make a warrantless arrest of a person who, they have probable cause to believe, has committed one crime only moments before and is still committing another crime, when that arrest requires a brief entry into the vestibule of a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.725" offset="391689">We submit that the answer to this question is that a warrant need not be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.238" offset="413737">Three independent arguments support our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.006" offset="428888">Two of these arguments assume, arguendo, that a warrant ordinarily must be obtained to make an arrest inside a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.173" offset="465459">We argue first that a warrant need not be obtained when a crime is in progress and the entry can halt that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.970" offset="500672">Second, we argue that a warrant need not be obtained --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="102.691" offset="515614">Do you mean when it is in progress, or when it is in progress and that fact is known or observed by the officer?</text>

            <text syncTime="110.942" offset="548633">And when the officers have probable cause to believe that it is in progress.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="114.901" stopTime="120.013">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="114.901" offset="564411">Just to be abstract without observation or without objective fact --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="120.013" stopTime="151.447">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="120.013" offset="584891">Unless it was known beforehand, if it just simply turned out that it was in progress, the after the fact justification would not be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.816" offset="616029">Second argument is that an entry should be permissible when it occurs within a few hours after a crime and during a time during which it might be supposed evidence might be disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.978" offset="676738">We submit that the case can be decided upon either of those two grounds without reaching the general issue of when a warrant must be obtained to enter a house to make an arrest.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="151.447" stopTime="158.069">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="151.447" offset="710592">Let me state that second ground, you say when it is supposed evidence might be destroyed, is that not always true?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="158.069" stopTime="185.250">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="158.069" offset="737133">Our general argument in that regard is that during several hours after a crime, it should be reasonable to enter a house to make an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.944" offset="768584">And that the general justification for that is that evidence might be destroyed during those first few critical hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.436" offset="794602">Whether or not there is reason to believe that it will be destroyed in a particular case as we submit immaterial that the justification of reasonableness extends to those cases as a class and it is not dependent upon the facts of a particular case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="185.250" stopTime="202.856">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="185.250" offset="845802">Is it dependent upon there being some likelihood that -- well, supposing you have a case in which the crime involves no other evidence other than just knowledge or reasonable cause to believe that a person say, committed a murder, but there is no evidence, you do not expect to find, does the evidence have any bearing and I understand –- I am quite following you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="202.856" stopTime="265.018">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="202.856" offset="916228">Well, it would be difficult to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.327" offset="926155">There is often evidence that a murder has been committed and that evidence might dissipate.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.572" offset="943082">In the case of Cupp against Murphy of course there were fingernail scrapings under the fingernails, type of evidence that might dissipate.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.582" offset="975161">But our justification runs to crimes as a whole based upon the fact that they are often used evidence of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.292" offset="1014031">The problem with figuring out whether there is evidence in a particular case is, we submit, the best argument against requiring the officers to figure out whether there is or is not?</text>
            <text syncTime="236.535" offset="1050916">It is such a problematic inquiry and it depends so much upon the facts of a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.763" offset="1075889">It will be very difficult to require officers or indeed to require courts to make that kind of determination before or after the fact in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.645" offset="1127402">The third argument is that it is always reasonable to enter a home to make an arrest with or without a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.443" offset="1202635">Our position is that that still should be so, but it is of course not necessary to reach that question here because of the two independent grounds that I have begun to set out and also because this arrest took place during the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.279" offset="1249969">Our primary support for that is historicalness, Mr. Justice Holmes wrote, “Page of history is worth a volume of logic.”</text>
            <text syncTime="293.550" offset="1279017">But I do not intend to discuss that point further unless the Court has further questions about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.263" offset="1365848">A Philadelphia Narcotics Squad officer arranged to purchase heroin from Patricia McCafferty.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.958" offset="1388627">Patricia McCafferty told him that she would go down to Mom Santana’s for the dope.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.726" offset="1411719">The officer recorded the serial numbers of $110 in $10 and $20 bills and gave the bills to McCafferty.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.972" offset="1444738">McCafferty visited Santana’s house, spent a few moments inside, and returned to the officers’ car with heroin, but without the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.135" offset="1481309">The officer gave a hand signal to other officers, and McCafferty told him that Mom Santana has the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.504" offset="1510880">The other officers then drove in there van, the short distance to Santana’s house, intending to arrest her for her part in the crime and to recover the purchase money.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.345" offset="1554243">When the group of officers drove up in there van in front of Santana’s house, they saw her standing in the threshold of her doorway with a brown paper bag in her hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.142" offset="1593427">One of the officers recognized the person in the doorway as Santana.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.524" offset="1614952">The officers left the van and ran up to the walkway to the front door of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.408" offset="1634491">There were approximately 15 feet between the curb and the doorway of the house, so it took about a moment to reach the threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.943" offset="1668555">Meanwhile, Santana had turned and retreated into the interior of her residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.898" offset="1688408">One of the officers overtook her in the vestibule, as she was leaving the vestibule for the living room of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.960" offset="1720695">Respondent Alejandro was in the living room.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.538" offset="1735010">When the officers overtook Santana they jostled her, and white packets, white packets filled with white powder, fell out the bag to the ground in the vestibule.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.743" offset="1775761">Santana ran from the living room, attempted to pick up the packets and attempted to flee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.761" offset="4619869">I would like to expand upon my answers to two of Mr. Justice Stewart’s questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.399" offset="4642439">You inquired, Mr. Justice Stewart about the nature the indictment in this case, and the indictment is indeed, as I indicated, for the possession of the heroin that was in the bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.306" offset="4686011">United States Attorney informed me that that indictment was returned, because Patricia McCafferty whose testimony would have been perhaps necessary for proof of the sale to McCafferty had indicated that she was unwilling to testify against Santana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.598" offset="4739196">And therefore the decision was made to indict her for the possession with intent to distribute the heroin of the bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.132" offset="4765319">Second question had to do with whether our position was that you could make a warrantless arrest entry at night?</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.272" offset="4793949">And I indicated that that our position was that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.119" offset="4805338">I should expand by saying that we believe that historically no warrant has been required and none should be required, but the reasonableness of requirement of the Fourth Amendment applies in full force, and it could -- and usually would be unreasonable to make a night time entry if a daytime entry would do as well to make an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.510" offset="4886841">So that we do not want to leave the impression that night time entries are a preferable or indeed unquestioned way of making such arrests, they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.279" offset="4925920">They are often unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.198" offset="4945564">This case does not involve an entry to search for a suspect who may or may not be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.558" offset="4967089">Does not involve a delayed arrest for a crime committed long ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.615" offset="4983285">The officers had seen Santana in the doorway with their own eyes and they knew she had committed a crime there moments before and probably was still committing a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.827" offset="5064160">And they returned that block and a half in a very brief time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.640" offset="5079415">This immediate arrest did not only put a halt to an ongoing crime but it preserved the evidence of that crime and of the crime that had just been committed in the sale to McCafferty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.365" offset="5118285">It prevented any possibility of flight, it produced maximum surprise, and by that token, maximum safety to the officers, because if the officers had been compelled to desist and defect the house arrest, their personal safety could have been in some danger, if they had later attempted to make the arrest once respondents knew they were there and attempting to arrest them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.177" offset="5197489">In many ways, this case is similar to Scher against United States, which we discussed in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.849" offset="5220163">Officers had possessed probable cause to believe that Scher was committing the crime of distributing distilled spirits and that he had some such spirits in his car.</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.165" offset="5281498">It observed that the passage of the car into the garage did not destroy the officers’ right to follow and to arrest Mr. Scher, and so it is here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1383.684" offset="5639585">The search would go no further than the permissible scope of search under Chimel against California, which included the person of the person arrested and the area within his reach at the time of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.265" offset="5689845">We do not believe, however, that the right to make the arrest of Santana depended necessarily upon the fact that she was committing the crime of possession of heroin with intent to distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.421" offset="5734462">And we submit that it is reasonable for officers to enter the house within a few hours after a crime and hear the crime of the sale to McCafferty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.463" offset="5766645">Whether or not this justification is called fresh pursuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.105" offset="5781273">It is based on an entirely practical understanding that the first few hours after a crime are critical, both to capture the suspect and to recover the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.777" offset="5819934">It is a justification based on exigencies that pertain to many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.688" offset="5839578">The decisions of the courts below by requiring officers to delay and invest one or more hours in obtaining a warrant, would disable them from acting during this most critical time immediately after a crime had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.215" offset="5893704">Once these first few hours have passed, the need for haste is diminished, but at least during the first few hours it is reasonable for officers to act promptly to make the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1637.422" offset="6654494">The issue before the Court today is in reality whether 200 years after the Declaration of Independence, Americans can be secured in the knowledge that the police may not broach the sanctity of their homes, seize them or there loved ones, carry them away without a judicial finding of probable cause for their arrest, accepting the argument that in certain cases, exigent circumstances would require an arrest without a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.578" offset="6847174">But your own knowledge what shows -- the record shows that she had just engaged in a sale of narcotic?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis H. Eisman</label>
            <text syncTime="1690.883" offset="6868385">Well, what the record shows in the District Court, and why the District Court I believe held this way was that the police set in motion the fact of the discovery of the arrest by their own action and immediately going to the house and taking the options of her immediately rushing up -- in plain clothes with guns drawn and rushing the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.372" offset="6958351">When the Court felt below that it would have been just as easy and more constitutionally proper for them to have gone immediately to the place where, in Philadelphia, where the Justices of the Peace sit on a 24 hour basis which is only a half an hour away, gotten a warrant and return and not rush the house with guns drawn and children sitting on a steps in plain clothes in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.878" offset="7064303">So I think the argument that once the police ran up to the house with their guns drawn that the defendant would have known that they were coming to arrest them would have destroyed evidence, begs the issue that the District Court found was that they should not have acted in that fashion. They said they had the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.278" offset="7129923">were no exigent circumstances absent what the police themselves created here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.101" offset="7153224">The exigent circumstances, as pointed out by the Government in this case, are all circumstances which were created by the Government’s action and could have been negated by merely getting a warrant and returning to the house and making the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.159" offset="7365443">But in this case the record clearly shows that she was inside the doorway, and a matter fact, one of the police officers testified even in the vestibule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.648" offset="7395432">And I think one of the reasons this case is here today is to decide the issue different from Watson, not a person out in a public place, but whether a person inside the home, has the security that we submit the Fourth Amendment gives additional rise to the security of the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.363" offset="7470246">In this case, there were absolutely, according to the findings of the District Court, no exigent circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.843" offset="7552166">It would have taken them 45 minutes to get the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.553" offset="7563033">Here the District Court found that under the facts of this case, they have ample time to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.715" offset="7583722">Thirdly, there was no information that the defendant was in anyway aware that the police was on -- were -- was on her trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.138" offset="7617368">And finally, there is no evidence whatsoever, and the record as it is stood when the police rushed the house that there would be an effort to dispose off the money, which is the only real evidence that the police were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.353" offset="7674210">In this case, that they were going in to seize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.404" offset="7686436">The court below asked a specific question, on Page 37 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.650" offset="7715379">Now, the minute you left, what was your purpose of going to the house?</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.097" offset="7729172">What did you intend to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.856" offset="7736277">Answer - I immediately intended to recover the marked money that was used in the transaction and arrest of defendant Dominguez Santana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.741" offset="7767729">Nothing in the record, in this case, that they had a reason to believe that there are additional narcotics present in the house or that this defendant in fact possess them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.113" offset="7805241">As a matter of fact, the record in this case interestingly reveals, no direct information that it was this defendant who made the sale, the evidence presented in this case was that the police officer saw McCafferty go into the house with Alejandro and come out of the house shortly after.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.141" offset="7877338">The Police had never seen Mrs. Santana at all that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.293" offset="7898027">And when asked about the transaction the only thing that McCafferty said was Mom has the money, not that Mom sold the dope, but that Mom had the money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1981.430" offset="8030521">But in this record, and I am not arguing with the finding of the District Court of a probable cause here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.112" offset="8057270">What I am saying is the record here is even a little unclear as to what knowledge the police had when they charged the house with their guns drawn, in plain clothes with children sitting on the step saying, police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.525" offset="8122889">Here in addition to the issues raised by the Government on their appeal -- there was the another issue that I do not think the Court really felt it necessary to get to, but that was that the circumstances of this arrest, the failure to say, we are here to arrest you, and merely running up with guns drawn into somebody’s home without stating the purpose for that entry, was in fact improper also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.999" offset="8232813">The sanctity of a person’s home is not only, I believe, guaranteed by the Constitution, but it is a tradition that goes back hundreds of years in England and/or Anglo-Saxon heritage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.368" offset="8290282">It is a problem not only that existed at the time of our revolution and, according to many writers, was one of the fundamental reasons why in 1776 there was a Declaration of Independence, but in fact, exist today outside of our country in England, the history of the Fourth Amendment which I do not intend to dwell on at any great length.</text>

            <text syncTime="2078.543" offset="8419014">In England there was no requirement for a warrant to make an arrest and I submit that is the reason why our Constitution was written or Fourth Amendment was written to the Constitution was to distinguish between what was going on in England and the colonies in those days, and what was hoped for to be different in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.112" offset="8505218">Because in England today, according to at least the press in London, that is before the House of Parliament, a bill that gives the Internal or Inland Revenues Service, as it is called in England, the right to go into somebody’s home and search for any papers necessary to prove tax evasion, take away anything necessary, and break doors, if necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.921" offset="8652548">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.347" offset="8654220">It is a warrant that is obtained from a Justice of the Peace, which according to the reports I have read, has absolutely no knowledge of what the Inland Revenue Service might be interested in, but the point I am making is this is a general warrant, the type of warrant that was used in England and in the colonies before the Declaration of Independence, which lead to the eventual finding that a Fourth Amendment to the Constitution was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.702" offset="8767592">If the Fourth Amendment does not protect us from intrusions into our home, and protect us from the police determination as to whether or not they are going to arrest us by putting between the police and the citizen a judicial disinterested determination, then what does the Fourth Amendment stand for?</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.020" offset="8872917">It has to stand for the fact that in America, citizens before they could be taken out of their house, whether be day or night -- and I do not think -- although it is a little more horrendous to be dragged from your home without a warrant at night than it is to be dragged from your home or have your sons or daughters dragged from your home in the day time without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.541" offset="8954942">At least if we know that before the police came to our house, absent exigent circumstances, that a Judge had found probable cause, then I believe we will be finding what our forefathers in the Bill of Rights wanted to offer for our country that we would be different from the systems in other countries, and that we would have the protections of a judicial determination of probable course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.089" offset="9069149">In this case, there was absolutely no exigent circumstances found by the Trial Court, and no reason to go into the home and drag out Mrs. Santana in the fashion it was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.321" offset="9118050">This was a row house with people sitting, children sitting on the step and the facts are that plain clothes policemen jumped out of a van, ran up with guns drawn, ran into the house, and grabbed the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.032" offset="9184924">It is a frightening aspect or specter to think of, even though when we consider that the crime involved is a crime that we consider serious.</text>

            <text syncTime="2316.419" offset="9370498">Where there is evidence that the person can destroy the evidence, or might destroy the evidence, or might flee, that that is a common sense and logical exception to the warrant requirement, but here in this case, and I believe, and the reason why this case is before this Court today is the determination of absent those exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.458" offset="9462658">Do we as American citizens have the protection of a judicial determination before we are seized?</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.734" offset="9495781">Normally, before this time most of the cases requiring warrants were just for the seizure of property, and I am the first to admit that property rights are extremely important in our society, but rights to physical arrest, I believe, are a little more important, and the seizure of a person is it goes even deeper than the seizure of a property, and people should at least be have the same rights to protection of a judicial determination before the seizure of their person that they have in the seizure of their property.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="2392.365" offset="9674249">Counsel for respondent has indicated that a problem in this case is the failure of the officers to announce that they were officers and to state their purpose and to demand entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.169" offset="9717508">I will deal with that just quite briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.779" offset="9727957">It is not clear that the Constitution requires any announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.059" offset="9749064">Ker against California presented that question directly, and four Justices believe that it did; four Justices that it did not, and Justice Harlan expressed no view on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.270" offset="9789920">Assuming the Constitution requires some sort of announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.170" offset="9805489">The pertinent analogue would be 18 U.S.C. 3109, which requires an announcement prior to the breaking of the door of a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.323" offset="9842060">Our reply brief devotes substantial space to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.989" offset="9856793">We have argued that walking in through an open door, in the view of someone who knows that the officers are coming, is not such a breaking that an announcement is required by Section 3109.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.064" offset="9905067">And in addition, there was no chance here that any of the harms that that rule was intended to prevent could come about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.296" offset="9949998">The rule was designed to prevent the exertion of force by officers, the breaking of doors when that kind of breaking could be avoided by consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.026" offset="9980927">It was also designed to avoid unnecessary opportunities for violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.026" offset="10000885">The householder in England had the right to protect himself against those who would break down his door and enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.363" offset="10030246">And the rule of announcement, by letting him know that the police were coming, would prevent that sort of violence, but this case does not present either of those two rationales and we submit should not be cover by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.302" offset="10074027">Thank you very much.</text>
