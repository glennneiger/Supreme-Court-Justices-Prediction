            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="34.054" offset="239510">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.225" offset="248183">We are here upon a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.038" offset="263438">The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s grant of summary judgment against the United States and did so on the basis of the District Court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law without any opinion of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.439" offset="309100">The District Court granted summary judgment to respondent, both upon his suit for a refund of taxes collected under assey and also upon the Government’s counterclaim for the unpaid balance of the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.634" offset="365838">Now, the facts underlying this suit are very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.847" offset="378691">The Los Angeles Police Department prepared an affidavit, somewhat lengthy design to show a probable cause for a search and obtained from a Municipal Court Judge a warrant directing a search for a bookmaking paraphernalia and in the search that ensued, respondent and one Morris Levine were arrested and certain property, including a $4,940.00 in cash were seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.482" offset="473254">Shortly after that occurred, the Los Angeles Police officer notified a revenue agent of the Internal Revenue Service of the arrest and of the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.410" offset="512960">There is a Federal tax of course on wages and since respondent and Levine had filed no tax returns for the period in question, the Internal Revenue Service checked the wagering records and calculated the number of days, the surveillance of respondent Levine suggested that the -- indicated that the wagering activity had gone on, that indicated a period of 77 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.668" offset="610031">Working with that information, the Service made an assessment against respondent Levine of about $89,000.00 plus interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.098" offset="639706">And pursuant to that assessment, the Internal Revenue Service levied upon the cash seized by the Los Angeles Police in partial satisfaction of respondent’s tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.681" offset="682024">The State prosecution for respondent Levine for illegal gambling found that when the same Municipal Court Judge who had issued the warrant granted a motion to quash it on the ground that the supporting affidavit was inadequate to show the reliability of the information passed on by the informants, although it was adequate to show -- indicate the reliability of the informants themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.782" offset="778469">Two years later, respondent began this tax refund suit and as I have said, the Government counterclaimed for the unpaid balance of the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.002" offset="815353">Now, the cases hold that a taxpayer claiming a refund or opposing a collection suit has the burden of proving his real tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.185" offset="852029">Respondent presented no evidence upon that issue, whatever. He relied exclusively upon a motion to suppress the tax assessment on the ground that the information upon which the assessment was based had been illegally obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.525" offset="925381">The District Court accepted that theory and suppressed the assessment and the Ninth Circuit affirmed as I say per curiam and without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.654" offset="961953">I think the legal theory underlying these decisions below is an extraordinary one or rather it must be an extraordinary one because it is not articulated in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals beyond the statement that the Government’s assessment grew out of knowledge that was ultimately held to have been obtained by a search warrant that did not meet Fourth Amendment standards, a warrant obtained by the Los Angeles Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.422" offset="1061009">How that fact connects with this tax litigation is nowhere explained and I will attempt to show that there is no adequate connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.231" offset="1100193">What has happened here is that the Court below without analysis or argument had fashioned a sweeping extension of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.668" offset="1133943">When I say without argument, I mean without argument by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.476" offset="1149198">This extension amounts to a new rule that not only may evidence be excluded from judicial proceedings, but that the Government maybe required to forgo its civil rights, if it knew of its civil rights, only because some other Government obtained information under a warrant subsequently held to be inadequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.314" offset="1524526">I suppose in the case of an informant speaking directly to Internal Revenue Service and the Internal Revenue Service would verify the information in some other way before they could collect the taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.026" offset="1575412">They might make an assessment on the basis of that information which could be hearsay even as a Grand Jury’s indictment could be based on hearsay and if the assessment were resulted in the collection, I think that is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.880" offset="1690873">I think one might, Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.574" offset="1701636">There is a suggestion in respondent’s brief here, that if this evidence, if this assessment is not suppressed, Internal Revenue agents will be free to break into homes and offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.925" offset="1746984">I find that suggestion mildly humorous because I do not think the Internal Revenue Services have such intention or perhaps indeed capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.738" offset="1778227">But I will suggest in the course of this argument that it would be unwise to extend the exclusionary rule to civil litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.784" offset="1822426">But the basis for that suggestion essentially is that in the world as we know it and as the Court observe it, illegal searches and seizures primarily occur in connection with criminal investigation and there just is not much evidence of or any perhaps evidence of illegal search and seizure in civil matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.899" offset="1894942">Should that become common by the Internal Revenue Service or any other agency of Government, then I suppose the time would have come to consider the extension of the exclusionary rule to that class of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.701" offset="1954083">But as the matter stand now, we have nothing like that and it would be a different case as you suggest.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.095" offset="2019703">Well, the only thing in the record on that Mr. Justice Blackmun, is the statement by the police officer here that when it was a large bookmaking operation, he generally passed the -- notified the Internal Revenue Service, for the smaller one he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.189" offset="2084069">He said that was not a Departmental Policy and he supposed that some other officers would not notify the IRS, but he would.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.248" offset="2112281">As a nationwide matter, I frankly do not know the frequency with which it occurs.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.417" offset="2136940">Mr. Solicitor General, suppose the Federal tax people were told or otherwise knew that the information that was being presented to it had been obtained by patently illegal search and seizure, I know you suggest that as a general rule he should avoid the exclusionary rule, but what about in the individual case where the officer knows, (Voice Overlap)?</text>

            <text syncTime="550.835" offset="2306632">All that can be done is to deter the police for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.166" offset="2320007">If there were a common pattern and practice by which police in any city or police generally conducted unconstitutional raids for the purpose of handing the information over to the IRS, then I think we would have a different kind of case altogether and we would have to consider at that point the fashioning of an exclusionary rule when the Internal Revenue Service attempted to benefit by that kind of a practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.967" offset="6331161">Before commencing with my argument, I would like to clear up one thing which I believe is in doubt right now and that is, the Solicitor referred to this case as being decided on a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.231" offset="6388212">The record is very clear that the plaintiff had made a motion for summary judgment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.192" offset="6412036">That motion was denied in April of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.531" offset="6429381">In February of 1973, this case came to trial in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.030" offset="6455399">All parties had an opportunity to present any evidence that they desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.629" offset="6473789">Accordingly, although the case was tried on stipulated facts and exhibits which were submitted by stipulation, all parties were represented, all parties were in the position to submit any additional evidence that the parties had.</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.525" offset="6569398">It would affect the basic proposition because the Government has chosen to rely solely on its certificate of assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.287" offset="6620493">It has not sought to introduce any other additional evidence, any untainted evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.440" offset="6653094">It is not thought to put anyone on the stand who could attest to the fact that perhaps the plaintiff was a bookmaker, that perhaps the plaintiff was engaged in bookmaking activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.803" offset="6702518">It relies solely upon a certificate of assessment, which in turn is based solely upon evidence obtained in violation of the taxpayer’s Fourth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.510" offset="6757375">And I think it is significant because as a former Government Counsel, I know that had I tried that case, I might have put a lot more evidence into the record and try to put evidence into the record, but here we have a naked certificate of assessment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1697.205" offset="6892167">The Government’s position appears to be that number one; the Exclusionary Rule should not be applied in a civil case and primarily that the rule should not be applied because it will not constitute a deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.724" offset="6962175">Additionally, as mentioned in the Government’s brief, the Government contends that not withstanding the fact that the Exclusionary Rule maybe applied, the Federal tax assessment retains its presumption of validity and as such the taxpayer has a further burden in order to rebut this presumption of validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.267" offset="7064366">With all due respect to the Solicitor General, I believe that deterrence argument is really here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.874" offset="7098847">Our record establishes that the Los Angeles Police officer who had arrested the taxpayer had contacted the Internal Revenue Service as a matter of his policy, as a matter of police procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3141.561" offset="12669512">The next question is, if it is illegally obtained, should it be excluded because of the deterrent effect and the final question is we exclude it in criminal cases, should we exclude it in civil cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.681" offset="12742028">I think that what we have here is a situation where no matter what the views of the various Justices are, if the evidence is illegally obtained in the first place, it is got to be excluded, assuming a deterrent effect can be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.000" offset="12823321">And I think that the area of reform, so to speak, and I am now getting exactly back to your question, is on whether or not, the evidence was initially illegally obtained in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.647" offset="12881940">It was clearly illegally obtained under Aguilar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.359" offset="12896777">It was clearly illegally obtained under Spinelli, but I cannot control the eight members of this Court as to whether it is clearly illegally obtained today.</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.778" offset="13314423">The Government thought that a summary judgment had been entered here because on pages 10A and 11A of our petition for certiorari, we have reproduced the District Court’s order which enters judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.865" offset="13366772">The Government had not thought that there was a trial because that the records shows only a discussion of the legal point and we thought that the respondent had had not have an opportunity to put in his evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.461" offset="13413166">Now, the District Court does refer to this on page 9A of our petition for certiorari as a trial and if respondent were correct about -- is correct about this and if we should prevail here, then the proper disposition would be to remand for the entry of a judgment for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.473" offset="13485159">But I think the situation is ambiguous and should the Government prevail, I think the remand should be for a disposition by the trial court.</text>
