            <text syncTime="13.490" offset="127581">The situation in these cases maybe briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.084" offset="149942">In each case, a taxpayer obtained from his accountant, the accountant’s work papers that have been used in the preparation of the taxpayer’s tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.085" offset="189961">Taxpayer then delivered the papers to his attorney where they were subpoenaed by Internal Revenue Service agents who were investigation the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.241" offset="230608">The issue is whether the papers were immune from the subpoena by reason of the Fifth Amendment’s privilege against compelled self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.152" offset="266239">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that they were not immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.072" offset="281912">We agree with that court and affirm that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.054" offset="297795">In the other case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held to the contrary and hence we reverse the judgment in 74-611.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.605" offset="340008">Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall have each filed opinions concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.271" offset="362683">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
