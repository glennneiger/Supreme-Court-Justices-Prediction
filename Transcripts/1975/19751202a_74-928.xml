            <label>Mr. John P. Rupp</label>
            <text syncTime="42.115" offset="271799">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.076" offset="283606">The government petitioned for writ of certiorari in this case after the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit it held en banc with seven judges dissenting that respondent for prosecution had been barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.036" offset="343479">The procedural context in which respondent's double jeopardy claim arose is set forth in some detail in our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.959" offset="371168">In order to provide a basis for discussion of the legal principles that we believe control this case, however, and because the government’s factual statement does not accord precisely with that relied upon by respondent, I should like to begin this morning by reviewing some of the events that preceded determination of respondent's first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.552" offset="445565">Respondent was charged in two counts of a three-count indictment with having conspired to distribute and with having distributed a control substance, LSD.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.710" offset="486107">At the time of his arrest, he retained Jeffrey Meldon to represent him and so far as appears in the record, Mr. Meldon continued to represent respondent without assistance until approximately five days before the trial began.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.753" offset="538352">This representation included the filing of several pre-trial motions and investigation into the charges and the complaint, rather the indictment and of the circumstances of respondent’s arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.848" offset="582656">At the time of trial, however, respondent appeared with three retained attorneys, Mr. Meldon, Morris Wagner, and my brother Professor Baldwin.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.094" offset="619645">After the jury had been selected and sworn in this case, they were excuse from the courtrooms so that the court could hear evidence and argument on respondent’s motion to suppress the LSD.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.437" offset="669069">In support of that motion, Mr. Wagner called the government’s principal witness, Steve Cox, the agent who had purchased the LSD. As Mr. Wagner’s questioning of Cox proceeded it became apparent that the motion to suppress was without a factual basis and that indeed the theory being relied upon by Wagner in support of the motion and support of his request for hearing on the motion would not have justified, would not have warranted the suppression of the LSD.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.561" offset="777529">The Court, therefore, became understandably annoyed with Mr. Wagner, particularly when he persisted on asking questions of Cox that bore no conceivable relation to the motion to suppress under any theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.705" offset="822146">The Court not surprisingly, ultimately denied the motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.475" offset="841163">Since the government’s case rests principally upon the testimony of Steve Cox, the anticipated testament of Steve Cox, Mr. Wagner's strategy was to attack Mr. Cox’s credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.819" offset="890587">His aim was to convince the Court that Mr. Cox’s testimony would not be worthy of belief because Mr. Cox had been involved in some way in an extortion attempt that allegedly directed at respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.917" offset="938966">The principal problem with this defense was that there was not a scintilla of evidence linking Mr. Cox with the alleged extortion, the fact that neither prevented Mr. Wagner from proceeding with that line of defense in his opening statement.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="223.630" offset="997794">Mr. Rupp, was the opening statement made before any testimony was presented or at the closing of prosecution's case?</text>

            <text syncTime="229.654" offset="1021931">Yes, it was made before any testimony was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.354" offset="1036768">The government, the assistant general attorney responsible for the case made an opening statement of just a couple of minutes on behalf of the government and Mr. Wagner’s opening statement proceeded immediately from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.460" offset="1093193">We have discussed the substance of Mr. Wagner’s opening statement at pages 4 through 7 of our main brief and that statement as whole appears in the appendix on pages 19 through 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.998" offset="1143348">I do not think that any particularly useful purpose would be served by my reviewing here the substance of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.815" offset="1170620">Even a cursory reading of it reveals we submit that the trial court’s judgment that Mr. Wagner was bent upon a conscious course of baiting the court in hope of declaring a mistrial was not only a reasonable judgment, but very probably an accurate one as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.149" offset="1227880">After Mr. Wagner had been excluded from the courtroom, the court was informed for the --</text>

            <text syncTime="317.442" offset="1373121">It is certainly not inconceivable to me, however, that misconduct engaged in by an attorney could reach a point at which it would be appropriate to exclude the man or the woman from the courtroom.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.610" offset="1597774">What I said was that during the motion to suppress, he had annoyed the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.092" offset="1619717">I think there were good grounds for the court having admonished him at that point to proceed more properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.715" offset="1642182">During his opening statement, however, he was rendering a trial, a chaotic at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.847" offset="1662662">He was refusing to comply with the court’s very clear instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.754" offset="1678336">He persisted in proceeding with the line of defense which he knew was without any factual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.627" offset="1709787">It was more than mere annoyance at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.460" offset="1717101">There was a cumulative series of events that occurred in this case and they occurred rather quickly I would concede, but they seem to me to support the judgment of the court that Wagner was attempting to trigger a mistrial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.242" offset="1768301">Now, I do not believe that the court has to agree with me on that point in order to find that respondent’s retrial was not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.914" offset="1798917">I think, however, that it is a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.107" offset="1815740">After Wagner had been excluded from the courtroom as I said, the court was informed for the first time that respondent was not prepared to permit his two remaining attorneys to proceed on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.832" offset="1858685">The court was informed of this decision the second time at a conference in chambers the morning following Wagner’s exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.232" offset="1884285">At the same conference, Mr. Meldon for the first time and now the Court as had been suggested by my brother Professor Baldwin, stated the declaration of a mistrial might be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.040" offset="1923469">The session in chambers was suspended to permit the parties more fully to consider that as well as other available options and when reconvened, Mr. Meldon did in fact moved for a mistrial on respondent’s behalf explaining to the court in a statement which appears on page 41 of the appendix, “That Your Honor, I have conferred with the defendant and he wishes to move for a mistrial at this time and after full consideration of the situation and an explanation of the alternatives before him, he feels that he would move for a mistrial and that this would be in his best interest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="485.196" offset="2044050">The Court then asked the government to respond to that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.594" offset="2057634">The government responded, “Your Honor, we have discussed this at some length and we think that for the reasons you have already set forth in the record a mistrial might be appropriate in this case and the government would not oppose a mistrial.”</text>

            <text syncTime="511.139" offset="2147913">At the session in chambers, the morning following Mr. Wagner’s exclusion, the court not only has saved the various options that were available, including a continuance, but also explained rather fully his reasons for having excluded Mr. Wagner.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.305" offset="2212488">Now the Court of Appeals, the majority of the Court of Appeals in considering the possibility of a continuance concluded that a continuance would not have been proper in this case because of the defendant’s, respondent in this court’s position that he would not permit either Mr. Meldon or Professor Baldwin to represent him a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.886" offset="2294825">So he would have been in a position then of having to get entirely new counsel and sufficient time would have to have been afforded to permit him to get up to speed on the case.</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Rupp</label>
            <text syncTime="640.976" offset="2667227">That is correct and I do not know what the life of this jury was, although perhaps should have a further point here and that is that the court was concerned about publicity that had attended this case, publicity in the press and at the time that he ultimately declared a mistrial, he referred specifically to the publicity as posing in his view a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.148" offset="2767851">When this case was called for trial and abnormal number of press people appeared and that increased the judge's apprehensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.642" offset="2801914">So that permitting the jury to go free, that is not sequestering them, in this case would have posed more serious problems than even in the normal case and that is apart from the problem of the life of jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.128" offset="2887805">Prior to a second trial, respondent moved for the dismissal of all charges against him on grounds of double jeopardy and alternatively to have Mr. Wagner reinstated, both motions were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.528" offset="2929392">The Fifth Circuit appeal to his ensuing conviction at a trial in which he proceeded pro se and the government’s petition to this Court followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.876" offset="2966799">Although this Court has repeatedly refused to fashion fixed and inflexible rules to govern the consideration of double jeopardy claims, the decided cases do provide some guidelines that are responsive to and reflective of the policies subsumed by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.170" offset="3023955">One of the most fundamental of this guidelines was that referred to by Mr. Justice Harlan in United States versus Jorn and that is where circumstances developed not attributable to prosecutorial or judicial overreaching, a motion by a defendant for a mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove any barrier to the prosecution, even if the defendant’s motion is necessitated by prosecutorial or judicial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.274" offset="3108383">If the events that respondent’s first trial leaves some questions without a satisfactory answer, they do what they are sufficient to establish it seems to me, both the appropriateness generally of attaching significance to a defendant’s motion to have his trial ended with a mistrial and the correctness of holding here that any barrier to respondents for prosecution was removed by his decision to move for a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.998" offset="3219351">The history of the Double Jeopardy Clause and the instances of its application in previously decided cases show that the policies, that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to further conceived of the clause as a buffer between the state and individual defendants and to protect the individual against harassment and abuse of the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.079" offset="3315586">The clause embodies are commitment to repose following an acquittal, preventing successive trials following a valid conviction as well as multiple punishments for the same offense and maximizing the chances fairly of resolving criminal charges in a single proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.168" offset="3372011">But this Court has also recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause cannot be used to frustrate legitimate suicidal interest in punishing those and bringing to the Bar of Justice those who are charged with crime and at the interest of society and of criminal defendants are in some circumstances best served by permitting defendants to move for a mistrial and permitting courts to grant such motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.814" offset="3466574">In United States versus Perez, this Court held that a second trial would not offend the Double Jeopardy Clause, if the jurors at the first trial have been unable to agree upon a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.987" offset="3511296">And in United States versus Ball, and United States versus Tateo, that a second trial was permissible if the first trial, if the conviction rendered at the first trial as was reversed on direct appeal or in a collateral proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.874" offset="3574825">Permitting a defendant to move to terminate his trial and giving discretion to a court to grant such a motion in the face of perceived prejudice is consistent with these rules and simply acknowledges the unfairness, the inefficiency requiring defendants to go forth in the face of perceived prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.079" offset="3647655">There are limits of course and the limits have been stated in cases such as Gori versus the United States, Downum, Jorn and so on where the defendant moves for a mistrial, retrial is not permitted if the precipitating event is attributable to judicial or prosecutorial over reaching, that is action by the Court or the prosecutor designed to avoid an acquittal by the jury then empaneled.</text>

            <text syncTime="997.122" offset="4091841">Well, that is still the rule in cases that are tried to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.585" offset="4113679">The British Rule of course is that jeopardy does not attach until the end of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.751" offset="4150355">The rule in the United States has been since Downum, since Gori that in trials before a jury, jeopardy attaches at the moment the jury is empaneled and sworn, although this Court has also said that that is the beginning, not the end of the analysis and I think that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.711" offset="4234156">The wisdom of permitting a defendant to move for a mistrial in the face of perceived prejudice and not requiring him to go to an ultimate verdict would appear to me to be almost beyond dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.772" offset="4282430">As Mr. Justice Harlan noted in the United States versus Tateo what would be high price indeed for society to pay where every accused granted immunity from punishment because of any defects sufficient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.742" offset="4338228">It is significant I think as well that from the standpoint of a defendant, it is doubtful as Mr. Justice Harlan noted that Appellate Courts would be as zealous as they are now in protecting against convictions rendered in part on the basis of prejudicial errors if they knew that reversing the conviction would put a defendant beyond the reach of further prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.289" offset="4456510">If retrial were barred following the declaration of a mistrial, but permitted following the defendant’s successful appeal, I think that what we must expect is that trial courts would deny such motion in a vast majority of cases and perhaps for very much the same reasons as Mr. Justice Harlan in this Court felt that the result reached in detail was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.363" offset="4580749">The majority of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals expressly declined to hold in this case that the Court’s actions in excluding Mr. Wagner was a product of judicial overreaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.046" offset="4623485">That is action by the Court designed to avoid an acquittal and respondent is never contended in this Court or prior to this time that the court was guilty of overreaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.847" offset="4666744">Although we have not urged that this Court to hold that the exclusion of Wagner was not error, neither is it at all important to the position we have taken in this Court, that is that respondent’s re-persecution was not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, even if error, the court’s exclusion of Wagner was not unlike the multitude of other errors that occurred during criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.866" offset="4754724">In fact, I should like to note in this regard that during the conference in chambers, the morning following Mr. Wagner’s exclusion, Mr. Meldon and my brother Professor Baldwin stated that in their judgment, the exclusion of Wagner had been proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.115" offset="4815746">Mr. Meldon stated after spending considerable time looking into the law, it is my opinion, I believe the opinion of Professor Baldwin that the action of the court yesterday was well within the discretion of the Court and would not be reversed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.100" offset="4863707">Professor Baldwin subsequently informed the court after a full night’s research, it is my conclusion that the Court’s action was proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1550.847" offset="6306711">In a number of cases, this Court has attempted to come to grips with the theory for Double Jeopardy Cases of this sort and Mr. Justice Holmes at one point suggested a continuing jeopardy theory, other courts have found that a waiver theory would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.618" offset="6381735">I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter, appropriately decided that those were rather arid exercises and what the court should abide in cases of this sort is looking at that policies that are subsumed by the Double Jeopardy Clause, the circumstances that existed at the point the mistrial was both declared by the Court sua sponte or pursuant to a defense motion and then decide whether the Double Jeopardy Clause was properly invoked.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.529" offset="6489464">Well, does that analysis suggest that much significance ought not be attached to the mere fact that the defendant made the motion, if the focus is to be on the policies covered by the Double Jeopardy Clause?</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.983" offset="6563234">It seems to me, however, that since one of the policies of the Double Jeopardy Clause is to maximize the opportunity that a criminal proceeding would be brought to judgment in a single proceeding and defendants do have an interest which we acknowledge in having a cost determined by a particular tribunal, the fact that the defendant would move for a mistrial is an indication and I think rather an impeachable one that he regards his opportunity to proceed as respondent did here is over weighed by other considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.078" offset="6707639">In this case, it was over weighed by considerations such as the fact that Mr. Wagner had proceeded to inform the jury of a line of defense that he simply could not prove and no evidence along those lines would have been admissible at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.238" offset="6760301">The Court had been required to excuse the jury three times in the course of only a few moments, Mr. Wagner had been admonished, the decision by respondent in this case to try again on another day seems to me to have been a legitimate and reasonable decision under the circumstances and clearly not coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.191" offset="6836057">Now, I would also like to mention that even if one concedes that the choice that respondent had to make in this case was a hard choice, it was a case that was presented to him in no small part because of the misconduct of his own attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.944" offset="6915051">This is not a case in which the defendant sat idly by while events passed him by without him being able to affect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.690" offset="6942114">Here it was defense's misconduct that brought this trial to the impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.910" offset="6954966">In that regard, I would like to bring to the Court’s attention a recent opinion written by Judge Friendly in which he discusses a situation not unlike the situation with which we have been presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.442" offset="7009092">I have given a copy of this opinion, United States versus Gentile and Laponzina and I will provide copies to the Court through the clerks since it is not yet reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.058" offset="7055590">In Gentile as in this case, there was substantial indications that defense attorneys were attempting to use the Double Jeopardy Clause as a sword, if you permit me to use that, engaging in rather sharp practices in hope of a triggering mistrial while at the same time having the Double Jeopardy Clause available to appeal to when the re-prosecution occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.248" offset="7160288">For the reason stated by Judge Friendly, for the reason stated in our main brief, we think that ought not to be permitted to occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.793" offset="8146463">The government in this case stresses two points, two major points that I would like in the time that I have to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.025" offset="8187423">First, that the defendant with his second retained counsel, moving for mistrial or at least the Hobson’s choice as the Court below noted, in moving for mistrial waived his right to plead double jeopardy in the Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.398" offset="8272896">And second, aside from that and barring whether the case involved a waiver or not assume arguendo it did not involved the waiver, the doctrine of manifest necessity or the ends of public justice prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.177" offset="8348024">The two major cases that the defendant would cite in support of his proposition, aside from the case that I was given yesterday afternoon which I will discuss later, are Tateo and Illinois against Somerville which I would like to discuss in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.186" offset="8424092">In response to his first point, the government argues that the mistrial was a direct result of the defendant’s motion and when a motion by a defendant is made for a mistrial that assumes to waive any double jeopardy claim that a defendant might otherwise have, regardless of the fact that there might be prosecutorial or judicial error.</text>
