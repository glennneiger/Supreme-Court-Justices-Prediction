            <text syncTime="856.338" offset="3529996">We would ask the clerk to modify the exclusionary rule to very least to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.279" offset="3561761">The magistrate perhaps was the person who was wrong if anyone was wrong and issued a search warrant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.387" offset="3606169">I do not believe that we can blame or that the purposes of the exclusionary rule would be served if the purposes are to deter unlawful action of the police or they have tried to do what is right, they have gone to a lawyer magistrate and asked for a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.584" offset="3703031">I don’t see how can there can be any possibility of deterrents to future cases, because it is the type of procedure we operate under, it is preemptory type writ, there is no way of having an immediate hearing to see if the writ is any good.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.068" offset="3760918">The police certainly would not be in a position every time they get a search warrant to question its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.714" offset="3803550">We encourage the use of search warrants and I believe the imposition of the exclusionary rule would go more to discourage the use of search warrants than to encourage it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1513.664" offset="6159273">Now, I cannot conceive right off where second issue would need to be but there could be a possibility I suppose where the petitioner is claiming that the Fourth Amendment resulted in being unjustly convicted because he was innocent and he had a valid opportunity to contest it, and yet it was under a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.200" offset="6261464">And if we did not adopt the first issue then he would still be able to bring it up under the invalid search warrant, in those cases only however.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.993" offset="6960605">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.536" offset="6974816">In the assignment of duties between counsel, in our case my colleague J. Patrick Green from Omaha, Nebraska was to have presented the oral argument and he has been incapacitated yesterday by severe attack of influenza.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.039" offset="7032807">I propose to deal with three points in the argument for the Court and be able to respond to questions from you, and in this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.460" offset="7070528">First, we think it of primary importance to deal with the question added to the grant of the petition for certiorari on 30th June, last year to whip whether the constitutional validity of the search and seizure performed by the Omaha police under the circumstances of this case is judicially cognizable under the 28 U.S.C 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.635" offset="7163211">Almost in identical language on that same day, June 30 in Powell versus Stone, the court again added that question to the grant of certiorari and asked the parties involved, both to brief and to argue those questions, and so I propose to deal with that question first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.196" offset="7229457">Secondly, I would like to deal with the need for Federal Review at lower court level federal constitutional questions, and by lower court level, I mean both the United States District Courts and the Circuit Courts of Appeal; with questions presented by state prisoners under 28 U.S.C 2254, in seeking petitions for habeas -- writs of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.876" offset="7332171">Thirdly, I would like to present arguments regarding the standards that should be used by either state or federal courts to determine a constitutional validity of the search in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.378" offset="7382221">Addressing myself to the first question, and transmitting any discussion of the facts which I think were brought out to some extent by counsel for the petitioner, I could deal with those in questions if the court so desires.</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.716" offset="7539478">But absent those two evidentiary hearings in March and July of 1974, before Judge Urbam granted the writ of habeas corpus, I think the Court would have had, had it come on direct review in an inadequate record before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.918" offset="7696318">This was raised of course in the concurring opinion in Schneckloth versus Bustamonte and there, when the Court -- when Justice Powell writing the concurring opinion, cites in footnote 16, Professor Amsterdam on certain finality interests that are to be -- that were to be concerned with in attempting to limit the Federal Collateral Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.106" offset="7801121">Justice Powell, realizes of course that Professor Amsterdam was talking about Federal Collateral Review for federal prisoners and not state prisoners --</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.837" offset="7843962">Right, and Professor Amsterdam was very careful I think to make the point that he did not think that those considerations need apply to state prisoners in seeking federal collateral review of their claims, based upon Federal Constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.970" offset="7908536">The next year in 1965, Professor Amsterdam wrote a considerably longer and exhaustive article, criminal prosecutions affecting federally guaranteed civil rights, discussing removal there and habeas corpus petitions to avoid state court actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.710" offset="7979485">And I understand him to argue from that law review article the need there is, especially in state court proceedings, for some sort of federal monitoring at Federal District Court and Circuit Court level of the application of Federal Constitutional standard's defect situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="4718.312" offset="18977872">That is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4722.637" offset="18995217">And another point that I think Mr. Cunningham brought up which highlights the bad part of having a habeas -- federal habeas corpus sitting years later is that when the evidentiary hearing was held before Judge Urbam some four years after the fact and the evidence is not clear at that time in the officer’s mind, they have had hundreds of cases probably since the time and one Lieutenant Perry testified at that evidentiary hearing four years later that he -- that Dwaine Peek had told them before they went to the Rice premises that the bomb was constructed there at the Rice premises and that Dwaine, his brother, had told him this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.043" offset="19168879">Judge Urbam, and he -- then Judge Urbam is doing the questioning and he said, well how do you know that?</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.679" offset="19191345">And he said, I was present when Officer Foxel (ph) interrogated Dwaine Peek and Judge Urbam then looked on the, a sheet they have at the police station that shows who was present at the interrogation, and Lieutenant Perry’s name did not appear on there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.435" offset="19258427">So Judge Urbam arrived at the conclusion that Lieutenant Perry was perjuring himself, and I think he put a lot of weight on this and this is just one of the bad things that happened by hiring before you litter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.467" offset="19302522">I say that Lieutenant Perry might have learned about in a number of ways and forgot how he learned about it, and it did not necessarily perjure himself.</text>
