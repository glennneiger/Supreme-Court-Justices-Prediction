            <label>Mr. Baum</label>
            <text syncTime="28.012" offset="215374">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.230" offset="228226">This case arises on certiorari to the District of Columbia Circuit and presents once again the problem which this Court has dealt with in its preceding two terms namely, injunctions against the assessment and collection of taxes and the prohibition against such injunctions which is contained in Section 7421 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.834" offset="330626">This Court dealt with it two years ago in Bob Jones University and Americans United.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.543" offset="357480">It dealt with it several years earlier in Williams Packing, and briefly again last term in American Friends Service Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.774" offset="390394">The Court of Appeals, on the very same day on which this Court announced its opinions in Bob Jones University and Americans United, reversed a decision of the District Court for the District of Columbia, dismissing this complaint for injunction and held that the case should be remanded for a hearing at which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue would be required to make a factual submission as to the basis for the tax assessment here involved and in which the respondent taxpayer would be permitted discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.873" offset="542845">The commission has sought rehearing on the basis of this Court’s opinions in Bob Jones University and Americans United, but the Court of Appeals refused to modify its decision and accordingly, we sought and obtained certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.423" offset="601046">The controversy arises in the following circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.151" offset="619959">Mr. Shapiro is a citizen of Israel who came to the United States in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.458" offset="649111">At some time in that year or shortly thereafter, he was indicted in Israel for security fraud and the government of Israel requested the government of the United States to permit his extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.208" offset="708148">The question of his extradition was litigated in the District Court for the Southern District of New York and in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.836" offset="742630">Both courts held that Mr. Shapiro was extraditable and ordered his surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.334" offset="768648">He then filed a petition for certiorari with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.559" offset="785575">While that petition was pending, Mr. Shapiro negotiated an agreement with the State of Israel under which he would withdraw his petition and would surrender for extradition, if the State of Israel would allow him to remain here until his then unborn child was born and we would allow him to remain on bail until his trial in Israel.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.979" offset="887243">The petition for certiorari in this Court from that extradition was then withdrawn and Mr. Shapiro was scheduled to surrender for extradition on December 9th 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.773" offset="938443">On December 6 of that year, three days earlier, the commissioner, upon learning from the Immigration and Naturalization Service that this extradition was to take place, and pursuing an investigation which had begun in September ’73, issued a jeopardy assessment against Mr. Shapiro for income taxes amounting to approximately $7,000.00 for the year 1970 and $85,000.00 for the year 1971 and levied on some bank accounts maintained by Mr. Shapiro which represented some, but not all of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.993" offset="1103328">This of course was a recognition of the fact that had Mr. Shapiro been allowed to depart, the bank accounts would have also departed and there would have been no funds available to the United States to collect taxes which it believed to be due.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.574" offset="1157559">At this point, I think it is appropriate to point out the procedure for these assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.783" offset="1178457">Normally, in income tax cases, the commissioner, if he determines a deficiency is due from a taxpayer, must under the code issue a statutory notice of deficiency, which provides that within 90 days thereafter, the tax payer may file a petition for review in the tax court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.452" offset="1277095">This is the procedure described in Section 6212 and 6213 of the Internal Revenue Code which appear in the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.087" offset="1315652">If he does not follow that procedure, that statute expressly provides that he may be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.195" offset="1340102">But, Section 6213 contains an express exception, namely for a jeopardy assessment under Section 6861.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.889" offset="1378868">That section provides that if the commissioner believes that the assessment or collection of a deficiency may be in jeopardy, he shall, not withstanding the provisions of Section 6213, immediately assess such deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.391" offset="1448876">If he does this before a notice of deficiency has been issued, the statute further provides that he must issue a notice of deficiency within 60 days of that assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.379" offset="1496837">Thus, in jeopardy assessments, the procedure is essentially reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.387" offset="1512824">The assessment comes first and the notice of deficiency comes second.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.641" offset="1625882">Section 6861 also provides that Notice and Demand for Payment shall be made by the commissioner in a case of a jeopardy assessment, without waiting the ten days which we have found to exist in other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.632" offset="1685859">The taxpayer has raised a point in brief and he raised it below that Mr. Shapiro never did receive notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.823" offset="1718564">This is contradicted, however, by an affidavit of the revenue service center official who is responsible for the mailing of the notice and a copy of that affidavit is printed at pages and 10A and 11A of respondent’s brief.</text>

            <label>Mr. Baum</label>
            <text syncTime="501.592" offset="2109670">There are numerous decisions, Mr. Justice Marshall, which hold that in a case of internal revenue notices, there is no statutory requirement that they would be received.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.780" offset="2146450">It is efficient if there is proof that they have been sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.232" offset="2160243">This has happened in a number of times in a tax court because of the statutory notices and we submit that we have established in a usual fashion and under the fashion required by the federal rules that it was mailed in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.032" offset="2215413">Indeed, a copy of the notice appears in the taxpayer’s brief at the following pages, 12A and 13A.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.413" offset="2252925">And the taxpayer however says, “The form says, taxpayer’s copy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="543.290" offset="2276435">It says taxpayer’s copy because he has failed to take into account the computerization of the revenue service, The revenue service file copy is a piece of magnetic tape, and the only way the service can reproduce a document is to push the appropriate button if that would be the device on the machine and it will print out on the form which has printed on a taxpayer’s copy because they do not make copies for themselves, they have the permanent magnetic tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.879" offset="2410809">In accordance with the prescribed procedure, the commissioner issued a statutory notice of deficiency to this taxpayer within 15 days, not 60, but within 15 days on December 21, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.146" offset="2475906">And shortly thereafter, on January 3, 1974, Mr. Shapiro filed his petition in the tax court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.841" offset="2510701">That petition is still pending and is awaiting trial and that is a factor which distinguishes this case from your prior decisions where there was no tax court petition pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.762" offset="2558349">In a meantime however, he filed this action for an injunction on December 13th in a District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to have the levies removed and also seeking to have his extraditions stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.388" offset="2612892">The latter part has been disposed off in the Court of Appeals and is no longer before this Court, that is the extradition and it was after that that he departed and returned to Israel.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.772" offset="2658345">After hearings before the District Court in December 1973 and after a copy of the notice of deficiency was filed with court, it dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction on the authority of your decision in Williams Packing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.047" offset="2719472">But the Court of Appeals reversed and held that that dismissal was incorrect because the court should have held a hearing at which the commissioner would be required to come forward with a factual submission to determine whether there was a rational basis for the assessment.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.266" offset="2876416">Now, the Court of Appeals did not indicate exactly what procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.944" offset="2895119">In fact, in conclusion of its opinion appearing on 16A of our petition for certiorari, it says that the District Court is not required to explore the matter and precisely the same manner as in Lucia and Pizzarello, each case is different and should be considered on its particular facts, which frankly I must admit, leaves us very little guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.327" offset="2992608">On the second point, it is exactly what happened in a District Court while we were considering and filing a petition for certiorari in this proceeding that illuminates it because the District Court has imposed a much more onerous burden on us than possibly even the Court of Appeals contemplated, I do not know.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.665" offset="7526003">Shapiro, the opinions says that after extradition, Shapiro will be incarcerated, an incarceration that will cause irreparable injury for which he has no remedy at law and so, the Court of Appeals then decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.291" offset="7692455">However, we think that if we were back in the District Court today, we could demonstrate irreparable injury from the fact that I think Mr. Justice White pointed out, which is that all of these man’s assets in the United States are presently being held by the internal revenue service which means that he is not able to pay counsel to litigate the tax claim that he suffers the same kind of irreparable injury that the Court of Appeals have held, for example, in the Village case which we cite an hour brief and the Sherman case, Third Circuit, the Fifth Circuit have both held that jeopardy assessments which essentially forfeit a man’s entire assets, deprive him of the possibility of living during that period of time, do constitute irreparable injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.414" offset="8292958">Now, if subsequent developments in the course of litigation are such that the further proceedings warrant, either an amendment to the complaint to allege a different form of irreparable injury, we think we are entitled to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.560" offset="8341545">We certainly think we are entitled to a remand and that is what is before the Court at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.681" offset="8358055">The government is asking for an affirmance, essentially a recessive reversal of the Court of Appeals and an affirmance of the dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.290" offset="8384491">We say that we are entitled to further proceedings in the District Court on various issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.092" offset="8407688">And I think that what the government overlooks is that there are three different issues in this case, which should be available to us in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.987" offset="8439243">One is the procedural issue, which I think I almost understood Mr. Baum to concede is an appropriate issue if raised by the pleadings and if properly presented to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.160" offset="8491906">Now, we said in a complaint, and it is very clear on the complaint, that there was no notice or demand before the seizure of these assets on December 6, that appears at paragraph 18 which is page 11 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.913" offset="8543002">Now, Mr. Baum says -- affidavit subsequently submitted to the District Courts says that this notice was set out and in fact, he says, “There is a copy of that that appears in our brief in pages 12A to 13A.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.048" offset="8595456">We pointed out in that hearing in the District Court that that affidavit was the taxpayer’s copy to which Mr. Baum responds as the trial counsel date in the District Court, well, that was just simply produced from the computer records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.921" offset="8655015">Well, the interesting thing which I do not think comes out quite clearly on the photo stat in the brief, is that the copy has a jagged edge, at least the copy that we received, which certainly makes it look as if it was torn off from some other copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.909" offset="8710917">These forms is I have seen them, as the taxpayer have several copies that you can tear off the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.677" offset="8737980">The taxpayer tears off the top, keeps it, sends back the second copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.410" offset="8752922">It looks to me if we would have a hearing that we might very well develop that the Internal Revenue Service has in its records the physical copy that should have been sent to Mr. Shapiro and never was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.828" offset="8802659">Now, if in fact that is true, then there was no proper jeopardy assessment under Section 6861 and the introductory language to the Anti-injunction Act which says, “Accept for Section 6213A, there may not be an injunction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.492" offset="8865248">It would apply because the exception would apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="2237.534" offset="9053434">We are not interested in coming here and taking the court’s time to get a rule that says well, if the government files what it filed in that subsequent hearing, the case is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.207" offset="9092096">We think that that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.809" offset="9098574">In fact, I think that what the facts develop really is that the basis for the Government’s claim that the taxpayer was unnoticed was a notice of deficiency served on him at 12:20 pm on the date that the complaint was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.997" offset="9155312">The judge said, “I will be reconvene court at 3:00 pm on Friday afternoon, December 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.672" offset="9177986">At 12:20 pm, we received as counsel, copies of this notice of deficiency which for the first time said, “This man is, in the government’s view, a dealer in narcotics.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.804" offset="9226574">The government rather extraordinarily says, “In light of that with Mr. Shapiro being in New York, being of the Orthodox Jewish faith, unable to come to Washington to appear at a hearing in response to that,” his counsel came into court saying that Mr. Shapiro was called on the phone and denies this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.240" offset="9296269">The government says in its brief, “The only thing that the respondent did was have one of his counsel tell the District Court the respondent had advised another of his counsel that the commissioner’s determination of income from narcotics dealings was false.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.293" offset="9360530">Well, that is all that he could do in the two hours and forty minutes that he had before the District Judge turned around and said that the case is dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.683" offset="9386025">Thereafter, Mr. Shapiro filed a verified petition in the tax court in which he denied being a narcotics dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.710" offset="9414133">Thereafter, at the hearing which Mr. Baum refers to, he filed an extended petition in the District Court which said, “I am not a narcotics dealer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.386" offset="9444853">Indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.508" offset="9449346">I think Mr. Chief Justice, you asked, “What would happen if the taxpayer came back with an affidavit or a document that established where he had received the funds.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.150" offset="9491874">That is exactly what Mr. Shapiro did in the hearing in the District Court, the record of which has been lodged with this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.591" offset="9525624">We filed an affidavit from a resident of Switzerland who had described in detail that she had held cash from Mr. Shapiro while he was in Switzerland and that she sent it over to the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.086" offset="11195684">In Enochs, this Court said, page 7 of 370 U.S., to require more than good faith on the part of the government would unduly interfere with the objective of protecting the collector from suing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.692" offset="11250123">So implicit in that was that good faith was an element of what the Collector of Internal Revenue had to establish.</text>

            <text syncTime="3143.221" offset="12676200">We think our case, and the same thing was true in Pizzarello, both of which involved admitted gamblers whose assets or who was the subject of a seizure as to which the proceeds of their gambling for a definite period of time was known for one day or for three days and the government made a projection from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.284" offset="12756448">In this case, we think it follows a fortiori from Lucia and Pizzarello because in this case, Mr. Shapiro denied under oath that he had ever been engaged in the illegal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.649" offset="12801901">One does not even reach the question of projection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.378" offset="12812873">In fact, if one looks at what the government relied in the later hearing before the District Court, they did rely on a projection precisely like that that was involved in Lucia and Pizzarello and which the Courts of Appeals in those cases held would be inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.818" offset="12874626">In this case, the government is asking a projection to be applied to the kind of conduct which I would think this Court could almost take judicial notice would not be as regular and repeated as it would be in the case of one who is writing a book making establishment who has regular daily customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.380" offset="12960830">At most, what the affidavit which appears in our brief and which was filed by the government in that hearing shows was that on several isolated occasions, they believed that the money that Mr. Shapiro received were proceeds of hashish sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.718" offset="13018195">So, we have here the denial of the illegal activity, and in addition to that, the projection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.797" offset="13046512">We submit that both those things together certainly warranted the Court of Appeals and saying that we were entitled to a day in court in which what the government used as a basis for its claim would come forward in court, what our client said in response to that would come forward in the court and the court would then make a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.681" offset="13134074">It is true that the Court of Appeals left vague what the contours of that finding would be and the judge has given -- the Trial Judge has given substantial discretion to proceed under such standards as he might think appropriate to this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.757" offset="13198336">But we do not think that that on anyway undermines the bottom line of the Court of Appeals’ decision which is really that, a complaint of this kind which alleges procedural deficiencies, alleges bad faith on the part of the government, raising constitutional questions and alleges that the basis for the jeopardy assessment which is arbitrary, excessive and beyond the constitutional power, therefore, the Internal Revenue Service warrants a full hearing in the District Court.</text>
