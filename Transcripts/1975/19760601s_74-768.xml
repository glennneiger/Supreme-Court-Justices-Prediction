            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="17.877" offset="145129">The first of these cases that is Brown petitioner against the General Services Administration and other is number 74-768 comes to us by way of writ of certiorari granted to review a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.872" offset="225064">The principal question presented by this case is whether section Section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, provides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in Federal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.909" offset="293191">The petitioner, Clarence Brown, is a Negro who has been employed by the General Services Administration since 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.719" offset="328509">At the time this litigation began he was classified in grade GS-7.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.510" offset="351601">In December of 1970 Brown was referred along with two white colleagues for promotion to grade GS -9.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.167" offset="382321">All three were rated highly qualified and the promotion was given to one of the white candidate for the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.081" offset="409906">Brown filed a complaint with the GSA Equal Employment Opportunity Office alleging that racial discrimination had biased the selection process.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.872" offset="449090">That complaint was withdrawn when Brown was told that other GS-9 positions would soon be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.917" offset="477302">Another GS-9 position did become vacant in June of 1971, for which the Brown along with two others was recommended as "highly qualified."</text>
            <text syncTime="110.126" offset="514082">Again, a white applicant was chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.581" offset="527980">Brown filed a second administrative complaint with the GSA Equal Employment Opportunity Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.219" offset="550445">And after several administrative steps, the GSA rendered its final decision in March of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.999" offset="581583">The agency's Director of Civil Rights informed Brown by letter by of his conclusion that considerations of race had not entered the promotional process.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.074" offset="617945">The Director's letter told Brown that, if he chose, he might carry the administrative process further by lodging an appeal with the Board of Appeals and Review of the Civil Service Commission, and that, alternatively, he could file suit within 30 days in a Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.914" offset="693282">42 days later, Brown did filed a suit in a Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.885" offset="713136">His complaint alleged jurisdiction under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with particular reference to Section 717, and also under two or three other jurisdictional claims one being Title 28, United States Code 1331, The General Federal Question jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.543" offset="807803">Another the Declaratory Judgment Act adds to another Title 42 of the United States Code Section 1981 arriving from the Civil Rights legislation of more than a century ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.383" offset="867154">The respondents, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that Brown had not filed his complaint within 30 days of final agency action as required by Section 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.495" offset="943536">And the District Court granted the defendants motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.373" offset="959105">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the judgment of dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.218" offset="978435">It held, first, that the Section 717 remedy for federal employment discrimination was retroactively available to any employee, such as the petitioner, whose administrative complaint was pending at the time Section 717 became effective on March 24 of 1972, and the respondents do not question that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.278" offset="1082716">The Appellate Court held, second, that section 717 does provides the exclusive judicial remedy for federal employment discrimination, and that the complaint had not been timely filed under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.436" offset="1139349">Finally, the court ruled that, even if 717 did not preempt other remedies, then the petitioner's complaint was still properly dismissed because of his failure to exhaust available administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.395" offset="1195147">We granted certiorari to consider the important issues of federal law presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.720" offset="1228479">For the reasons discussed in the Courts written opinion filed with the clerk today, we agree that Section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended in 1972 provides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims and  discrimination in federal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.157" offset="1306220">Since Brown failed to file a timely complaint under Section 717(c), the District Court properly dismissed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.121" offset="1342060">And the Court of Appeals properly affirmed that judgment of dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.100" offset="1362017">Accordingly the judgment of the Court of Appeals is today affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.969" offset="1381452">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion which he has been joined by Mr. Justice Brennan Mr. Justice Marshall took no part in consideration or decision of this case.</text>
