            <text syncTime="16.180" offset="168047">Case comes to this Court on the writ of certiorari of Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.754" offset="190304">The case involves petitioners conviction for violations of the male fraud statute 18 U.S.C. 1341.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.463" offset="221128">The indictment charge that the petitioner Mr. Goldberg and Edwin S. Newman and three other quote defendants had violated the statute in connection with the issue on sub single premium annuity policies to various individual annuities who in term pledged those annuities as collateral for existing or for new loans with various lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.822" offset="326558">The annuities were issued from a life insurance company located in Phoenix, Arizona known as Financial Security Life Insurance Company, sometimes referred to in the brief that as FSL.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.642" offset="373892">The indictment charge that the defendant and his codefendants made false statements to the lenders who considered making loans or who made loans in the policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.821" offset="414643">All of the defendants with the exception of petitioner and Newman pleaded guilty to one of more counts prior to petitioner's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.197" offset="456126">Petitioner went, his case went to trial by itself and he was found guilty of 14 counts of the indictment and sentenced to two years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.577" offset="493637">On each of the count said the sentence to run concurrently and fine $1,000 per count.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.341" offset="520700">Following petitioners conviction, Newman whose case was severed about a week before petitioner's case was scheduled for trial and the indictment against Newman was dismissed and he was permitted to plead guilty to two misdemeanors.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.211" offset="580155">The issue on which the writ was granted was whether the Jencks Act contains an attorney's work product exception and whether the government attorneys notes of conversation would keep government witnesses to whom the prosecutors have read back their notes from time to time, whether witness would correct the prosecutors notes from time to time, if not compellable under the terms of the Jencks Act are compellable under the greedy doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.783" offset="682450">Subsequent to this Court's granting of the petition, United States conceded for the first time that certain of the notes contain in a packet of notes which was personalized in the Court of Appeal on August 12, 1974 at the time of argument, oral argument that certain of these notes were in fact not the notes of the prosecutors as has been represented all the way of the line but in fact were the handwritten notes of the witness Newman.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.542" offset="1173448">Well, are you assuming Mr. Smaltz that anything impeaching within the language of the Jencks Act necessarily is embraced within Brady?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.866" offset="1210751">Brady talked about exculpatory evidence as I recall, and they did not say that anything impeaching to a witness for the government was necessarily exculpatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.647" offset="1521921">I believe that a number of lower courts one of them being Johnson versus Johnson have indicated that the Jencks Act embodies the constitutional provisions of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment as an issue that we doubt with some rank in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.508" offset="1597363">Secondly, second reason why this Court can consider the issue of Newmanâ€™s no handwritten notes, is that the document plain error enables the court to consider it and since it was the government's failure to disclose this material both to the trial court and to the Ninth Circuit, petitioner cannot be charged with the responsibility for not knowing of these matters, because he was not furnished the fact that these notes until August of 1975 when solicitor generals office for the first time provided him with --</text>

            <text syncTime="2025.352" offset="8204775">In each case the request was for prosecutors notes and in each case well at least in the third case, this is in the record, in the written motion filed by Mr. Smaltz, he specifically said we are talking about notes that were generated prior to the time that Mr. Newman took the stand in the government's case in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.465" offset="8285128">There was no Jencks request when Newman took the stand as a rebuttal witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.551" offset="8437474">The question was never asked what happened there, did the prosecutors take notes, did you write notes, there was no request for Jencks material.</text>

            <text syncTime="2138.086" offset="8655649">That is what he said in his brief in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.755" offset="8666307">The time of oral arguments in the Court of Appeals, as I understand Mr. Smaltz had filed the brief that the court had some question about whether it would accept because it was too long for a reply brief and some sort of an arrangement was struck where by he would waive oral arguments if the court would let him file his brief, the government was then asked would it waive oral argument too, not wanting to interfere with the court's plan to save some time, the government said sure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3929.227" offset="15820201">Judge Kopal orders the government on May 15 before the trial begins to produce every document which he had in his possessions or as it deems possession they are out to produce copies of them for you referring to me because I have made this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.602" offset="15877775">For the defendant, that is every document that is to be used in presentation of the government's case, all Jencks Act's statements who witnesses who will or may be called will be delivered to the defendant by tomorrow.</text>

            <text syncTime="3966.633" offset="15969830">I believe that it was the intent of Judge Kopal (ph) to have the government turnover to the defense all Jencks Act statements, but Judge Kopal had no way of knowing as the defendant had no way of knowing of the fact that Newman was writing these statements and there was no way for that fact to come to attention of anybody unless the prosecutor fulfilled its duty and called that fact to the attention of the court, which it did not do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3993.601" offset="16077768">Why did you moved three times during the trial for Jencks Acts statements if judge Kopal already entered an order prior to trial request -- requiring the government to turn them over?</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald Smaltz</label>
            <text syncTime="4004.071" offset="16119564">Well, I moved three times because I believe that Mr. Lebowitz had taken notes which constituted Jencks Act statements and I believe that the prosecutor did not feel that that complied or that attorney's notes were required as Jencks Acts statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.212" offset="16188214">During the cross -- during the direct examination of newsman, even sitting away at counsel table, I could observe that the prosecutor was reading from a document that was handwritten out and rather detailed and I was not creating my neck to see that because there was a huge book that the prosecutor had on his desk and that is what prompted me initially in my cross-examination to ask those questions about attorney's notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.314" offset="16292599">Further, I would like to invite the court's attention to page 5 and 6 of our reply briefs because the second reason that I asked about attorney's notes was that newsman, while he was committed to having made a complete statement to the government by the terms of that plea agreement, only made a partial statement and I knew that somewhere along he had to fulfill that requirement to the government and I felt it was odd that a reporter was not present and in pages 5 and 6 of our reply brief, we attempt to analyze why that agreement in and off itself makes the attorney's notes compellable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.975" offset="16443169">I would like to say one more thing and that is that the government argues, the legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended to shield prosecutor's trial notes from production.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.215" offset="16496145">Our review of the legislative history of Congress in enacting Jencks Act which was cited in the government's brief discloses no such concern for attorney's notes, but does disclose a concern for the witness, in questioning a witness about a statement he never saw or whose language he never adopted or approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.787" offset="16606486">Now, the congressional intent with respect to the meaning of adoption or approval, we agree is not precisely set forth in legislative history, but nonetheless the thrust of the provision was to ensure that unless the defendant had in some way been informed that the statements attributed to him and has indicated his approval of their accuracy the summaries should not be turned over to the defense, but in the context of this case for the reasons that we set forth at pages 6 and 7 of our reply brief, Newman was committed to giving an accurate statement and the prosecutors were committed to receiving an accurate statement for the reasons we have expressed in our brief and here at oral argument, we respectfully submit that petitioner's conviction should be reversed in a new trial order.</text>
