            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="44.365" offset="280780">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.023" offset="295408">These consolidated cases present a factual variation on this Court?s decision three terms ago in Couch against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.915" offset="346922">Couch involved enforcement of an Internal Revenue summons, seeking to secure a taxpayer?s records in the possession of her accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.542" offset="405436">Here, by contrast, we are concerned in both cases with the accountant?s own records, reflecting his work product in preparing tax returns for the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.897" offset="470847">In each of these cases, the records were in the accountant?s possession when the Internal Revenue Service special agents first indicated to the taxpayers that they wish to investigate their tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.227" offset="540228">In each instance they have been accountant?s possession for at least several years, and in one case dating back to 1959 and it was in both cases, only after the initial investigative contact between the agents and the taxpayers, that the taxpayers hired the attorneys who now have possession of the records, and the accountants were requested to deliver the records to the taxpayers who then handed them over to their attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.140" offset="695813">In one instance, within about five minutes and in the other instance in twelve days.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.945" offset="739072">The Internal Revenue summonses were issued shortly thereafter to the accountants and the attorneys requesting the records and the testimony of the accountants about the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.673" offset="801975">There are slight differences in the records involved in the summonses in the two cases, but in both instances, they are records from the accountant?s files, working for the taxpayer in helping to prepare his income tax returns and compiling other financial information for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.807" offset="894553">Upon refusal of the accountants and the attorneys to comply with the summons, these enforcement proceedings were brought, and in each case, the Fifth Amendment privileged against self-incrimination was asserted on behalf of the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.935" offset="967069">In the Third Circuit case, Fisher, the taxpayers intervened to assert the privileges for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.221" offset="996221">In the Fifth Circuit case, Kasmir, the taxpayer?s attorneys sought to assert it on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.212" offset="1044182">Both District Courts found that the records were still owned by the accountants and rejected the claim of Fifth Amendment privilege on the merits, and ordered enforcement of the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.362" offset="1116803">The District Court in the Fisher case summarized it findings on page A7 of the appendix to the petition as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.030" offset="1183467">The facts in the instant case as presented before this Court, demonstrate that the papers were and are the property of the accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.550" offset="1217531">They only left his possession after the taxpayer learned of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.830" offset="1238638">The transfer of the papers seems to indicate that this was an attempt to thwart to Government?s investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.363" offset="1268731">And much the same could of be said of actual situation in Kasmir, where the time span was even shorter between the call of the special agent and the transfer of the papers to the taxpayer and then on to the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.910" offset="1354935">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit sitting en banc affirmed the enforcement order with one Judge dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.483" offset="1393283">A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the enforcement order in that case, again, with one Judge dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.833" offset="1446677">Our starting point in analyzing the problem here is that these materials sought in the summonses would not be subject to a claim of the privilege against self-incrimination while in the accountant?s possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.887" offset="1526820">This follows a fortiori from the holding in Couch, which held that even papers belonging to the taxpayer would not be subject to a claim of the privilege while in the non-transitory possession of the accountant, and it also follows from this Court?s opinion in California ers and other cases, holding that there is no privilege against self-incrimination with respect to third party records as production is sought from third persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.003" offset="1687317">And so the question becomes whether they are transferred to the taxpayer in these circumstances, created a right to resist their production on the ground of the privilege against self-incrimination, where that right otherwise would not have existed and there is a further question, which I think is a less substantial one, of whether the subsequent transfer to the attorney affected the right in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.734" offset="1834229">In the only other post Couch case dealing with this question, the transfer was handled the other way and that is in the Beattie case, which we have reproduced with the convenience of the court and the appendix to our reply brief in the Kasmir case.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.495" offset="1925240">That is a Second Circuit decision, dealing with an almost identical factual situation, except that there they decided to have the records transferred from the accountant through the attorney to the taxpayer and the taxpayer now has the them in his possession, rather than the other way around, but basically the same issues are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.941" offset="2047075">Now, we believe that the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Beattie were correct in rejecting the claim of privilege here, based on really two lines of cases supporting their view.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.567" offset="2141534">The first are the cases dealing with what are essentially third party records, in the possession of the claimant of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.277" offset="2188450">Those cases have in the past involved largely organizational records, such as corporate records, labor union records, partnership records in the most recent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.358" offset="2248740">The line of authority starts with Wilson against the United States and goes through Wheeler, Grant, White and finally Bellis, a recent decision of the Court, and we have developed those cases in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.409" offset="2328989">In essence, they hold that the privilege against self-incrimination being an intimate and personal right, maybe applied only to one?s own personal papers.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="570.353" offset="2384682">You are talking now simply about a subpoena to produce a non-testimony in connection with --</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="576.192" offset="2408087">That is correct, in resisting a subpoena to produce the papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.680" offset="2426060">Those cases hold that an individual in custody of the papers can invoke the privilege only with respect to his own personal papers, not with respect to other papers whose essential characters, the expression that has been used in the case is ?non-personal,? even though they are rightfully in his possession and in several of these cases even though he has a claim of title to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.389" offset="2548835">In fact, the Grant case involved a claim of exclusive title by the sole shareholder of a dissolved corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.590" offset="2593661">The Bellis case also involved a claim of co-ownership of the records, but because the records were not the personal papers of the individual claimant, it was held that the principle of the Boyd case does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.908" offset="2666909">It seems to us that the result reached by the Third Circuit and the Second Circuit here follows a fortiori from these cases, since here there could not even be a claim of ownership asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.280" offset="2724378">In both instances, the District Court found that the papers were still owned by the accountant and the Court of Appeals did not disturb those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.319" offset="2768577">There was some evidence to the contrary in one of the cases, but it was properly rejected.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="691.789" offset="2870455">That the accountant does have a superior proprietary claim if he should choose to assert it.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.770" offset="2898354">In the absence of express contract specifying otherwise the accountant?s records and work papers belong to the accountant rather than to his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.366" offset="2980796">But we do not think the criterion in these case really rests on whether the possession is rightful, whether the accountant has acquiesced in the taxpayer?s possession of the records or whether he has demanded them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.478" offset="3045266">It seems to us that under the Court?s decision, the question is whether these are the personal papers of the individual seeking to resist producing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.388" offset="3096884">Otherwise, you get into the situation referred to many years ago by Mr. Justice Holmes in matter of Harris, of use of the privilege against self-incrimination as a method of gathering evidence that could then be immunized from legal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.315" offset="3184551">As he put it in that case, the right not to be a witness against one?s self is not a right to appropriate property that may tell one?s story, but this was said in the context of a question of who has the superior proprietary right as between a rupt and the trustee in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.133" offset="3299803">As many of these aphorisms by Mr. Justice Holmes, we think the legal principle cuts much deeper and indeed goes to the heart of the distinction under our system between an inquisitorial and an accusatorial system, which is as the Court has recognized one of the functions of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.988" offset="3423206">One of the purpose is, the basic policies of the privileged, as recited in the Murphy against Waterfront Commission and other cases, is to assure that we will have an accusatorial system of justice in which instead of extracting incriminating information from the accused's own lips, from the accused himself, evidence will be gathered from other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.296" offset="3524456">This line would become, it seems to me irretrievably blurred, if an anticipation of valid legal process, whether it is an internal revenue summons, a grand jury subpoena or a trial subpoena, the person under investigation could go out and gather up the evidence that is supposed to be used in place of forcing incriminating statements from his own lips and immunize that evidence by claiming the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.903" offset="3750886">We see very little difference, I mean, obviously the accountant?s information has to be an information that the taxpayer has given him in one way or the another.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.361" offset="3792786">Whether it is verbally or in writing, so long as it is a non-privileged disclosure, it seems to me that that information as reflected in the accountant?s records is beyond the reach of the taxpayer?s proper scope of his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="977.784" offset="4014409">They would -- and if they were the taxpayer?s own papers of which the accountant had returned to the taxpayer then there would at least be a much more substantial basis for assertion of the claim whether there would be some impropriety because of the fact that the investigation was already underway, I think could be argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.504" offset="4121302">But in the absence of that factor, it seems to me that private papers in the hands of the taxpayer are the kind of thing that the Boyd case is about and in --</text>

            <text syncTime="1575.921" offset="6407016">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.713" offset="6422167">As we understand the Government?s argument in this case, they say that the privilege is unavailable to the taxpayer here, basically for four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.431" offset="6461038">One, they say the taxpayer did not own these papers; two, he was not the author of them; three, he did not maintain them in sufficient secrecy, that argument is not made explicitly, but the quotation from the language from Couch about the expectation of privacy is relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.904" offset="6534912">And Finally, they rely on this doctrine which is explained more fully by Judge Friendly in the Beattie decision, that there is in effect no incriminating act of production here, and therefore, production of the records they say will not incriminate the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.698" offset="6614115">That premise, as I understand it, that theory is based on the notion that the privilege does not protect the writing itself, but rather the privilege insofar as applied to documentary evidence is based upon the testimonial act of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.392" offset="6680884">We take issue seriatim with each of these arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.877" offset="6698856">First, we say that this Court has held in Couch and in White that ownership, that to the tie the privilege to ownership is a meaningless -- is to draw a meaningless line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.833" offset="6750683">And in the White decision the Court said, that the papers in effect which the privilege protects must be the private property of the person claiming the privilege or at least in his possession in a purely personal capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.276" offset="6812437">Certainly admitting the possibility of the application of the privilege to papers that are not owned by a person.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.099" offset="7099679">As the Court there said, the paper on which the computations were made belong to them, that is the accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.636" offset="7121831">They were not employed to make these sheets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.823" offset="7130608">The sheets were merely the means by which the work for which the defendants? were employed might be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.024" offset="7151402">The title to the worksheets remained in the defendants? after the computations were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.027" offset="7175434">In the absence of an agreement that these sheets were to belong to the plaintiff, or were to be held for it, they were owned by the defendants, that is the accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.753" offset="7210334">Now, we submit to this Court that the Court meant what it said in the Couch case when it stated that to tie the privilege to a concept of ownership is to draw a meaningless line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.130" offset="7259862">And that this fact illustrates it because the concept of ownership, a great constitutional privilege should not turn on a question as privilege as who owned the paper prior to the performance of the accountant?s functions, nor we submit; will anything be accomplished in this Court if that ownership concept is adopted, since all that will be required to alter to outcome of any case will be a prior agreement between the client and his accountant that the work papers will be owned by the client when the work is done, as we understand the common law concepts of ownership as applicable to this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1919.438" offset="7781057">Rather than simply the argue the Court?s language back to the Court, which a Court is in the best position to construe and interpret, I tried to understand by going to the basis of these concepts why that was in fact the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.490" offset="7841243">The other reason very quickly, why we say ownership is not only meaningless in an elevation of form over substance, but also we think very dangerous is we pose to the Court, the situations for example, where, let us say notes of a psychiatrist or notes of a priest in the confessional might be involved in the governmental subpoena -- summons case, perhaps having come back into the possession either of the parishioner or of the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.059" offset="7955555">In those situations if ownership dictates the outcome of the privilege, there is no question that under the common law that those papers as they -- as they were originated were the property of the psychiatrist or of the priest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.106" offset="8007696">Yet we suggest that the statements they contain are essentially a blueprint of a man?s mind and they are as entitled to the privilege as statements to a man makes upon the witness stand himself.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert E. Goodfriend</label>
            <text syncTime="2133.902" offset="8638918">My answer to that privacy rationale, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is that suppose I where to admit that I committed a crime to a friend of mine, and the government knew of that, they would be able to put the friend on the stand and have him testify, but because of that fact, they could make me mount the stand and repeat what I had told him previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.745" offset="8738288">In fact, I suggest to the Court that the expectation of privacy rationale, which was -- which the government relies on here, is totally misapplied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.243" offset="8776323">What the Court was talking about in Couch, when it was directing its attention to the -- to the statement that there was no legitimate expectation of privacy between the accountant and the -- and the accused was to Mrs. Couch?s argument that she stood in these shoes of the accountant, therefore, directing process to her accountant, was the same as directing process to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.565" offset="8881544">That is a very different question in what is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.348" offset="8896695">Namely, there is no question that the Government concedes that directing process to one?s attorney is tantamount to directing process to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.023" offset="8931385">What they are saying -- arguing instead is, if you somehow treated these papers previously in a manner inconsistent with privacy concepts, namely, you gave him to an accountant for purpose of republication portions of the information, then you have forfeited the privilege and we are now authorized to compel you to produce documents in your actual possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.794" offset="9022500">So, privacy becomes a rationale for authorizing or justifying testimonial compulsion directly against the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.928" offset="9058967">We reject that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.120" offset="9071820">We, turning again, to Judge Friendly?s analysis, which I think is critical, Judge Friendly says in effect that the application of documents is limited to this act of production and he says in this case if the taxpayer comes forward with the records there will be no incriminating act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.515" offset="9161367">We submit that, first of all under the Curcio rationale there is a testimonial statement with the productions even in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.983" offset="9191252">Namely, when you come forward you state -- the attorney comes forward and states and I think it would be binding on his client that these are all the records called for by the summons.</text>

            <text syncTime="2281.198" offset="9228136">Of course, Curcio was examined at some length as to why it did not have the records, not why he did?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert E. Goodfriend</label>
            <text syncTime="2286.133" offset="9247885">That is right, but as I understand it, the Court did say in dicta in that case that when you come forward you make a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.041" offset="9279441">The holding of the case that is correct, was whether that you could go further and compel him to tell you the whereabouts of records when you place them elsewhere, but what the Court said there was in that case the mere act of production was not incriminating because you recall there was a collective entity involved, and therefore, with respect to the act of production there was no incriminating statement; since the collective entity of association or partnership had no privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.355" offset="9388737">Here the Government has expressly taken that point out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.121" offset="9403784">They say they are not arguing the collective entity exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.716" offset="9418203">So therefore, here when you come forward and produce the papers and a natural individual and he says these are all the papers called for by the summons, that is in fact an identifying act and the mere fact under Judge Friendly?s theory that you can get the accountant to do that for you, is not a reason to make the accused himself to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2477.465" offset="10013168">They usually direct the subpoena to the man who has the right to custody as opposed to the man who has physical custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.419" offset="10040963">So, the whole standing question has been created by the person to whom the government shows to direct the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.827" offset="10074608">Had they directed the summons to the client and said produce any records that you have or that are in custody of your agents, there would be no standing question in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2585.478" offset="10445234">The issue in this case as the petitioners in 74-18 C is whether the taxpayer has a Fifth Amendment right with respect to documents which are properly in his possession, in a purely personal capacity, prepared at his personal direction for his personal use, based entirely on personal records supplied by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.956" offset="10547111">The record in our case makes very clear what the nature of the documents sought by the government is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.176" offset="10576055">They are simply summaries of canceled checks and deposit receipts of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.603" offset="10601759">The accountant in preparing this record has simply transcribed information from the canceled checks and deposit receipts in no different way than a Scribner would transcribe information from documents that are given to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.285" offset="10668424">We submit that when a citizen makes available to a third party, personal information and that third party merely transcribes that information, and the document containing that transcript is given back to the citizen and the citizen can assert a Fifth Amendment protection if the production of that document will incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.103" offset="10759748">We believe that the facts in this case are very compelling and fall squarely within the Fifth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.466" offset="10785139">The Government argues in this case that solely because the taxpayer made a revelation to a third party of highly personal material, that he in some way forfeited his Fifth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.451" offset="10845116">We can see no justification in the Fifth Amendment for such a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.701" offset="10866118">The compelled production by the taxpayer is no less self-incriminating and the information is no less personal, of no less a personal nature because of this disclosure to a third party.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.022" offset="11103415">We would like to point out to the Court with respect to the revelation of this information to an accountant that we believe it is particularly inappropriate in this situation to hold that this works a forfeiture of the Fifth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.401" offset="11172900">In Pennsylvania for example, there is a state statute, 63 Pennsylvania Statute Annotated Section 9.11 A, which creates an attorney-client privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="2795.414" offset="11284914">This was the twenty-five year history of the accountant-taxpayer relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.874" offset="11310827">The accountant further made clear and testified that he was holding these papers for a temporary period solely as a matter of convenience and it was holding them at the request of the taxpayer as the taxpayer wanted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.069" offset="11375611">We also believe that the reason for the taxpayer going to the accountant, argue strongly against working a forfeiture of the taxpayer?s Fifth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.772" offset="11418347">It is precisely because the tax laws in this Country make it mandatory or necessary for many taxpayers to seek third party assistance, that a taxpayer goes to a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.418" offset="11469025">It is in the taxpayer?s interest and we submit it is in the government?s interest that the taxpayers avail themselves of assistance of qualified third parties, as the taxpayers did in these cases going to certified public accountants and to hold the taxpayers who do seek this assistance which is important to them and to the government, thereby forfeit a Fifth Amendment right, we believe is very inappropriate to the policies of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2933.431" offset="11837038">The government, we believe in their brief and in their argument to this court in the Couch case, has conceded that if this accountant had been an employee of the taxpayer or even he were serving as an independent contractor, but did his work at the offices of the taxpayer and left his records at the offices of the taxpayer, that the taxpayer could claim a Fifth Amendment protection with respect to these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.543" offset="11953439">We cannot perceive any policy of the Fifth Amendment, which is advanced, by making the status and the work conditions of the accountants determinative of the applicability of a Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="3296.903" offset="13290909">We believe that the Boyd case fully supports the position we are taking with respect to the act of production being a testimonial response by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.006" offset="13327376">After all those were third party documents and the taxpayer by producing them were saying, this is the invoice and the government wanted that invoice to establish how much glass there was in the twenty-eight or whatever number of quadrants have been imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.577" offset="13389652">They wanted the invoice for the truth of the averments in the invoice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.417" offset="13408982">The Second Circuit said with respect to the Boyd case, that the invoice had significance in establishing that the claimant had received the invoice, but there is nothing in this Court?s opinion in the Boyd case that indicates that there was any relevance whatsoever to the fact that the claimant had received the invoice and in fact the Court?s opinion is quite to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.930" offset="13503023">The Court said, on the trail of the cause it became important to show the quantity and value of a glass contained in the twenty-nine cases previously imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.135" offset="13539803">The only significance of that invoice was for the truth of the statements contained therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.892" offset="13558820">Therefore, the production of the invoice in Boyd was testimonial in exactly the same way the production of the documents in this case would be testimonial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.198" offset="13780130">It seems to me that line of cases establishes that production of a third person?s records that are not one?s own personal papers can be required of the custodian.</text>
