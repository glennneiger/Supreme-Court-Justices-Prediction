            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103355">We will hear arguments next in Ohio against Gallagher.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert M. Jacobson</label>
            <text syncTime="38.934" offset="259045">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.492" offset="281301">Our respondent in this case is a man by the name of Terry Gallagher and in a resume of the facts as they developed a trial, he was tried without a jury and the Court found him guilty in November of 1972 and the offense was armed robbery and he was thereafter sentenced to the Ohio penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.195" offset="392060">At the time of the offense however, Gallagher had been on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.927" offset="415048">He had been placed on parole in February of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.704" offset="430095">His parole official was one William Sykes who was a member of the Ohio Parole Authority and was assigned to our area.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.253" offset="472308">Upon being informed of the armed robbery, Sykes, saying that it was part of his duty to do so and part of his job, visited Sykes at the County Jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.524" offset="533435">He visited Gallagher at the County Jail, sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.760" offset="542317">Now there are two visits that Sykes made to Gallagher.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.569" offset="565618">One was on June 26th of 1972 and the respondent did not speak to him and failed to make any statements whatsoever and there was no conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.455" offset="645135">Four days before that, however, on June 22nd, the respondent Gallagher had been contacted by Deputy Sheriffs of our County who were investigating the armed robbery offense and had presented him with a printed Miranda Form which had all the warnings on them and he acknowledged these Miranda Warnings and signed the stencil form that had Miranda on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.635" offset="817856">This was admitted to be a voluntary act by him and that he fully understood that he was signing an acknowledgment that Miranda had been ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.832" offset="874594">This in effect, was one of the reasons why Gallagher did not talk to Mr. Sykes when he visited him the first time on June 26th.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.335" offset="912628">Keeping in mind that he also was on parole and had not been in contact with the criminal system before and when Sykes then determined that in furtherance of his duty as a state parole officer to go back and visit with him and he did so a week later on July 3rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.429" offset="1013043">Now this was eleven days after he had received his full panoply of rights under Miranda and in an informal conversation at that time, Sykes obtained or rather heard from the respondent Gallagher of his participation in this armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.762" offset="1106353">There were no Miranda Warnings given at those conversations that took place between Mr. Sykes and Terry Gallagher on July 3rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.469" offset="1145223">Later at the trial, the state called Mr. William Sykes as a witness and he testified on behalf of the state indicating what Gallagher had acknowledged to him and of course the statements were inculpatory and he further indicated that he was not forced to talk his parole officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.046" offset="1255459">The objections were made at the time of trial to Mr. Sykes' testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.499" offset="1281268">The Trial Court overruled the objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.865" offset="1294748">The matter was taken to our Second District Court of Appeals and in an unanimous opinion the Appellate Court there held that there was no prejudicial to the respondent Gallagher and affirmed the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.083" offset="1347619">The matter then went to the Supreme Court of our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.194" offset="1372070">Leave having been granted for the appeal and they in turn found that the utterances that were made by the respondent to Sykes on July the 3rd were inadmissible because the parole officer had failed again to warn the respondent of his rights under Miranda --</text>

            <text syncTime="977.886" offset="4014826">Well, the Supreme Court of Ohio in making its ruling in which they did reverse, indicated in their finding that there was an inherent compulsion in the parole officer-parolee relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.515" offset="4089327">Our feel and position is that we do not believe that this is to be consonant with the Fifth Amendment principles and that is the reason we petitioned for the writ through this Court and that is the basis in my judgment upon which it was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.183" offset="4172083">Now, basically, one of the questions involved here is whether the principle of Miranda under the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution should be extended or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.369" offset="4236762">Now, it was Miranda itself that made applicable under the Fifth Amendment to the area of confessions obtained at a police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.102" offset="4295695">And this had formally always been an area where the reliability of confessions and the principle of voluntariness as developed by this Court, were fashioned under the Due Process of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.407" offset="4388899">The Fifth Amendment speaks of compulsion and the witness may not be compelled to testify against themselves and that would apply to the area of the Courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.931" offset="4459012">So when Miranda came out and said that to circumvent this compulsion idea as a necessary component for the usage of the Fifth that the atmosphere was inherently compulsory and therefore the Miranda warnings were developed in the famous case of Miranda versus Arizona and that automatically now creates compulsion when these statements are not given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.579" offset="4613657">So, it takes statements which have been obtained from an accused, a statement which is purely voluntary, a statement which is reliable and truthful and stands the test of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment, under the theory of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.709" offset="4706131">It takes it out of that area of the Fourteenth and places squarely under the Fifth, because Miranda says so and I feel that this is really an arbitrary artificial test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.467" offset="4781154">To say that just because Miranda is not cited or there is a failure to give the full panoply of rights, which otherwise would be a voluntary statement without Miranda and now it becomes a compulsory statement, compelled by the accused to be made just merely because of the failure of given the warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.013" offset="4903407">I am re-arguing Miranda because I think the test there is that as such that I will tie it in in later goes into -- Miranda first took it out of Courtroom into the jail house, where statements are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.383" offset="4964847">They then have indicated our Supreme Court of Ohio that we are now taking it out of the jail house and we are putting it into the area of the parole officer-parolee relationship and that we are in a new area --</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.200" offset="6244116">At that point, it is the duty of a parole officer or a probation officer to maintain a dialog with his parolee, to maintain a cordial relationship, to try to see if he can help him get back onto the road where he will stay out of the jail house in the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.438" offset="8597017">The respondent was in fact interrogated on June 22nd 1972 in a small police interrogation room by two detectives and by a member of the probation authority, not the parole authority but the probation authority was confronted with another alleged accomplice who had supposedly already pled guilty to this charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.753" offset="8698268">Prior to discussing the matter with the respondent, the police did in fact have him execute a Miranda Warning Form and read them to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.679" offset="8746019">It was subsequent to that, that the police or the detectives in fact obtained statements against interest from the respondent and obtained then by promises of leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.324" offset="8804638">As the record shows, the police promised to drop some 20 charges against this individual or would not file 20 additional charges which they could not prove anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.043" offset="8855525">So they in effect gave him nothing for something and got the admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.805" offset="8878513">It was not until at the time of trial when the motion suppressed was sustained at the parole officer came into the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.568" offset="8925533">I think any discussion involving this can only go back to the Mathis case and that case indicates that any person who is one of the authorities, who may put someone in jail or who may cause criminal prosecution at a subsequent time must in fact give the warnings in the Mathis case, of course it was the tax investigator and there was a subsequent prosecution based on information gained while he was in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.498" offset="9065340">I think the rights waiver in this case is entirely in effective in any manner and as much as it was gotten or it was used only as a tool in obtaining a confession rather than as a deterrent to person incriminating him so.</text>
