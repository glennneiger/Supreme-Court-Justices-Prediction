            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103359">We will hear arguments next in Dann, the Commissioner of Patents against Johnston.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.951" offset="291127">Mr. Shapiro you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="howard_e_shapiro" startTime="49.919" stopTime="691.563">
            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="49.919" offset="302935">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.469" offset="317145">Three years ago in Gottschalk against Benson, this Court held that a method of programming a general purpose digital computer to convert signals from one form of binary number or another was not a patentable process under Section 101 of the Patent Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.425" offset="401050">In this case, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has held that a computer program used to keep records of financial accounts is patentable as a new machine rather than as a process, even though the application in our view claims no new apparatus and the program is carried out in conventional general purpose computers, intentionally designed to handle such programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.761" offset="522363">The case is here on a writ of certiorari under Section 1256 of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.599" offset="549739">The issues before the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and before this Court, are whether such a program is patentable subject matter under Section 101 of the patent code, and whether use of computers to keep track of financial transactions as disclosed in the specification in this case, is obvious from the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.301" offset="652557">Now, as the Benson case explains in some detail, a general purpose digital computer operates by performing arithmetical and logical operations on numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.337" offset="700623">Now, all of the data is reduced to digits represented by the symbols “1” and “0” in the binary-number system and these numbers can be made physically to correspond to on and off states of electronic signals, and these are controlled through the opening and closing of electronic pathways within the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.645" offset="797903">It is a sort of system of switching among circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.571" offset="813576">This switching process is accomplished through a sequence of coded instructions called the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.100" offset="843669">Now, to create a program, the problem to be resolved, it has to be reduced to a series of sequences or steps expressed in a language which the computer will accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.456" offset="909080">In effect therefore, every computer program requires an algorithm, which is a precise and complete step-by-step recipe for a computational procedure because computers do not think, the algorithm has to set out in very exacting and specific rules, and it has to be expressible in a programming language.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.214" offset="1004166">The computer then takes the expressed language, which is usually in a higher language, you go through several steps from ordinary human thought to a special computer language as to language that is close to what the machine actually uses and through a translator device, the computer converts the language into the machine’s code.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.299" offset="1092459">This reduces the program to the binary number system of on and off states and then the computer can carry out the arithmetic and logic functions by which it operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.012" offset="1143346">Now, the patent application in this case discloses a computer program for an accounting system.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.741" offset="1178246">The system permits the maintenance of individual customer accounts, say by a bank, by assigning category codes to checks and deposit slips that are marked in a machine-readable magnetic ink.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.341" offset="1244701">The categories of transactions are -- are computed as totals, and they are reported as statements to the customer so that he can find his rent expense for a period or his repair expense or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.743" offset="1306246">The specification which describes the steps in some detail, it sets out flow diagrams for the programs and it gives as an example of a specific program, a program for use in an IBM 1400 general purpose digital computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.846" offset="1394644">The -- the accounting aspects are shown in the -- in the appendix at pages 72 and 83, at least illustratively, because they show a sample check with the category code and a transaction journal and a summary statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.901" offset="1470921">I think the -- a precise way into this specification which is long and detailed would be to glance at page A7 of the appendix, which states that in the system a data processing -- a data processor EGA store program, digital computer embodying this invention is employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.936" offset="1567052">The program may assume many different forms that are well known in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.002" offset="1587323">Now, that is essentially all that this specification deals with.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.435" offset="1601011">When you go on through it, you do not find any description of “apparatus” or “circuitry” of any -- or devises of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.814" offset="1630582">What you find are the steps, the sequence of steps to be carried out in the computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.375" offset="1652838">So in our view, this specification describes a system of records and procedures for carrying out accounting in a general purpose digital computer system.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.023" offset="1707382">The patent claims are very broadly worded.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.529" offset="1725459">The accounting procedures can be carried out in existing computers long in use and no new machinery is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.941" offset="1755029">Now, the patent examiner in this case rejected the application under Section 112 of the ground that it was indefinite and inadequately disclosed, and under Section 102 on the ground that prior patents anticipated these inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.681" offset="1826082">The respondent appealed to the Patent Office Board of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.581" offset="1845622">Now, the Board at this time was constrained by decisions of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, particularly Ingrid Bernhard (ph) and its progeny, which hold that each program for a general purpose computer makes the computer into a different machine and that, therefore, if it is a new program it becomes a new machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.732" offset="1946246">The logic of this is said to be that electronically the program sets up a different set of circuits, and therefore, it is structurally, at least for the few millions of a second that the program and the circuits are in existence in the machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.749" offset="2026285">This Court’s decision in Benson had not come down at this time, when the matter was before the Board of Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.388" offset="2056900">Nevertheless the Board of Patent Appeals, for the first time in this case held that the patent application was not patentable subject matter within Section 101 of the patent code.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.795" offset="2118445">It said that the claims did not enhance the internal functioning of a computer, but were merely a process for using it, using that computer for purposes outside the technological arts; this was an attempt to accommodate CCPA decisions as they then stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.359" offset="2180721">It expressly held that a computer operating with any given stored program is not a different machine simply because somebody decides to assign to its memory a particular human meaning and the Board specifically found that there was no difference between the apparatus claims which were in this patent and the machine claims they really had to stand or fall together, and then finally the Board held that the claims were obvious in the light of prior art because it has said that banks have long been using magnetic ink machine-readable category codes, and also that the system fell within the disclosure of apportion of another patent previously issued, the Derk’s (ph) patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.852" offset="2362742">The respondent challenged the Board of Appeals decision in the court of Customs and Patent Appeals on every ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.470" offset="2397223">Now, while the appeal was pending, this Court’s decision in Benson came down and then the respondent abandoned his process claims, living only the machine claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.956" offset="2443095">The commissioner argued in the court below that Benson applied both to the machine and the patent claims, and that the computer programs were unpatentable under Section 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.879" offset="2482801">The respondent argued, referring particularly to the CCPA’s earlier decisions that a computer program is a physical structure, that machine claims are patentable under Benson, that Benson has not affected the rule in the CCPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.154" offset="2539957">That an unprogrammed general purpose computer is a different machine and -- in effect he said that Benson was confined to machine claim -- was confined to process claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.325" offset="2600561">The court below held again that that record-keeping machine systems, which comprise programmed general computers, digital computers, are statutory subject matter and they could be patented if they were not obvious in the line of prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.717" offset="2678197">Again it reaffirmed its decision in the Bernhardt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.815" offset="2694601">It held that Benson was inapplicable, because Benson dealt with a process claim and these were drafted in the form of machine claims and of course it rejected the holding of obviousness from the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.737" offset="2758236">Judge Markey (ph) dissented, concluding that the disclosure was obvious, and then Judge Rich (ph) wrote a very interesting decent in which he analyzed Benson and concluded that there is just no difference between machine claims and structure claims in this context, that it is simply a matter of the patent draftsman's art and that meant the thrust of Benson clearly indicates that computer programs are not patentable.</text>

            <text syncTime="889.235" offset="3660296">A step in its reasoning, a step in its reasoning is no longer valid, that is right because of Benson which made clear that these computer programs are not patentable.</text>

            <text syncTime="908.702" offset="3738141">If we look at the specification, we can see that what we have got here is nothing more than an accounting system carried out in a computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.234" offset="3780250">Now, as an accounting system, the disclosure is unpatentable because a method of transacting business is an abstract concept without a physical embodiment; an abstract concepts and laws of nature and mental process are not patentable and certainly business methods are not patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.546" offset="3849527">When you take a business method or an accounting system and you embody it as a sequence of steps for using a general purpose computer, it is also unpatentable subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.628" offset="3885785">Now, Benson clearly holds that a mathematical formula is not patentable.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.425" offset="3905011">It then goes on to hold that such an abstract concept does not become patentable when it is expressed as an algorithm for a computer program.</text>

            <text syncTime="995.491" offset="4085256">The -- in fact I think that since all computer programs are algorithms, are series of steps, sequences of steps, none can be patentable under Benson as either machines are process, and this is the thrust of Judge Rich's analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.404" offset="4496946">The grant of the patent in effect is a grant of a monopoly on the general idea of providing individual financial record keeping by computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.381" offset="4532786">We think that at most the disclosure involves a new use of an old machine and even that I think I would have to qualify the new use, but when you claim it is a machine, you run into the -- the long-standing rule that you cannot get a machine patent on a new use of that machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.298" offset="4612512">And that is clear in the patent law, and Congress made it doubly clear in 1952 when it added to the patent code the definition of process, which says that a process is a new use of an old machine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.002" offset="5519274">But I think the answer to that is that -- that a special purpose machine can accomplish the same results as a programmed general purpose device, but equivalence of results is not equivalence of means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.442" offset="5577057">It is well established that the results that a machine achieves, the function of the machine, to use the old language from Corning against Burden, is not patentable as a machine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.877" offset="5678830">There is an argument made that the, there would be an unconstitutional discrimination to grant a patent on a hardwire machine, but not on a program general purpose machine or rather to put more truthfully on the program itself, I think the answer to that is that it is up to Congress, as the Court pointed out in Benson, to decide how far it will go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.625" offset="5757824">In Deepsouth against Latrum (ph), the Court pointed out that the scope of the patent clause is for Congress to implement, and that is what really takes care of the equal protection argument in Nash (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.080" offset="5815607">Now, finally there is a, I mean, really what this sounds in -- is the problem of -- of technology overtaking existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.158" offset="5847895">We faced this in the CATV area now and the Court’s decisions have reflected that and in recently I think in the Radio Music case, 20th Century Music Corporation against Aiken, where the technology just does not fit the existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.382" offset="5908812">Congress was called on to do something about this in Benson, it has not acted on computer programming yet, we do not know whether it will.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.976" offset="6359163">One solution to that problem of providing a computer is to do the same thing that is done in a large corporation of the government to have all of the departments or users conform to the single system, a single algorithmic procedure that the computer is constructed to operate on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.307" offset="10228525">The very first programs that we know of took place some hundreds of years ago in the time when the patent system was developed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.448" offset="10329148">What they did with the program was to replace the human being at this tedious mental and physical labor, and build a mechanism for interconnecting the parts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.270" offset="12968352">New use means you compare the current invention with the prior machine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.669" offset="13101994">New use when it was written into the 1952 statute was for purposes of extending patentability because you could not get patents before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.785" offset="13134490">The patent office is arguing here that it ought to be used to restrict patentability, not to extend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.416" offset="13184959">A point is raised in the reply brief that I would like to speak to just quickly and that is with regard to misuse of patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.935" offset="13219023">It is a completely misleading and erroneous statement to say that the law is such that a staple article of commerce like a general purpose computer could be tied in by means of a patent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.898" offset="13350889">First I note that in respondents’ analysis, he has not pointed to anything in the language of its application, which expressly describes a circuit configuration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.357" offset="13408776">Those words do not appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.350" offset="13416717">No drawing appears showing any particular circuit configuration of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.999" offset="13439287">What is described is a sequence of steps that can be carried out in a computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.409" offset="13472933">The reference has been made to a hardwire version, and the phrase special computer use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.231" offset="13512221">The respondent himself, in his application at A66, drew the distinction between a general purpose computer which is programmed and a hardwire version, but there is nothing in this application that would tell anyone how to build a hardwire version There has been a discussion of the meaning of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.704" offset="13634161">I think if you look at the appendix to the petition at page 37A, one can see the way that any claim for a process, involving a computer program can be simply revised by a few words to be a machine claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.494" offset="13749308">It is literally a matter of substituting the word machine and substituting the word means, but that has to be backed by some sort of structure description in the specification and that just is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.548" offset="13809495">It has been stated that the program -- the application is not limited to any particular program, so that what is claimed is the general right to use computers for this particular kind of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.169" offset="13887966">A word on the obviousness question which we have submitted on our briefs, obviousness does not require the same mechanisms to be in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.940" offset="13931016">Obviousness is the gap between what exits and what someone skilled in the art could bring into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.058" offset="13967588">The same mechanism's issue is a matter of anticipation by prior patents, and that is not before the Court, that arises under Section 102, the obviousness issue under Section 103.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.966" offset="14015130">Judge Markey, in his dissent on obviousness was quite specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.903" offset="14050970">He said that one skilled in the art presented with a conventional machine system would have found that obvious without knowledge of appellant's disclosure to have modified the system, as set forth in the appealed claims.</text>
