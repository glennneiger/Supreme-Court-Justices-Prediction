            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103379">We will hear arguments first this morning in 74-742, Foremost-McKesson, Inc. against Provident Securities Co.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.168" offset="151967">Mr. Moskin, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Morton Moskin</label>
            <text syncTime="15.264" offset="164401">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.709" offset="178194">This case is here on a petition for certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.826" offset="202644">It arises under Section 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.915" offset="226990">The Court of Appeals found that a holder of more than 10% that is to say, a beneficial owner of more than 10% of the equity securities of petitioner, within six months of that purchase which made respondent such an equity owner, sold certain of those equity securities and realized a profit thereby.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.473" offset="305253">Nevertheless, it found that there was no liability under the statute because it concluded that the transaction by which respondent became a 10% beneficiary was not one that met the requirements of a Section 16 (b) purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.753" offset="362305">To come to that conclusion, it relied upon a proviso in Section 16 (b) which provides that the subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such, both at the time of the purchase and sale or the sale and purchase of the security involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.963" offset="435134">This decision of the Court of Appeals was contrary to all of the preexisting authority, particularly that of the Second and Eighth Circuits and the Stella case was the case which we contend is the -- was and should remain the prevailing authority on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.412" offset="496992">The key facts all arose in a two-month period in September and October of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.172" offset="519980">On September 25 in 1969, petitioner and respondent entered into an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.793" offset="550491">I should pause to note that the statute provides that a purchase is defined to include an agreement to purchase and a sale is defined to include an agreement to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.682" offset="586017">The agreement was one by which respondent would exchange some $54 million of its assets, roughly two-thirds of this personal holding company’s assets, in exchange for $4.25 million in cash and just under $50 million of debentures which were immediately convertible into common stock of Foremost-McKesson.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.815" offset="678595">On the 13th of October, two days before the closing under that agreement, the shareholders of Provident met informally to consider what their agenda described as the Section 16 (b) problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.053" offset="739513">They went on two days later to close this transaction and acquired at that point in time $40 million of immediately convertible debentures.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.505" offset="773368">Five days later, another $7.5 million of these convertible debentures were delivered pursuant to adjustments in the closing price under the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.859" offset="810775">The next day, on October 21, respondent entered into agreement along with petitioner and Dillon, Read &amp; Company on behalf of an underwriting group to sell $25 million of these convertible debentures and the closing under that underwriting agreement took place on October 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.058" offset="895516">The respondent would undoubtedly stress two additional facts and I would like to put those before the bench at this time as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.698" offset="922161">They argued that on October 13, the day when the shareholders informally met to consider the “Section 16 (b) problem,” the Board of Provident also adapted a so-called liquidating dividend, one which did not fix any specified date for the liquidating dividend and which was subject to various contingencies and other legal requirements, including the fact that, under California law, debtors and others with claims against the company would have to be satisfied before any liquidation could take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.668" offset="1054027">The second point which perhaps they will stress or emphasize or report to you is that on October 24, between the date underwriting agreement was signed and the date it was closed, there was distribution of 2,225,0000 face amount of these debentures to shareholders of Provident, and we concede --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="255.293" offset="1124453">You are speaking now of the seven days between the 21st and the 28th?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="morton_moskin" startTime="260.207" stopTime="428.883">
            <label>Mr. Morton Moskin</label>
            <text syncTime="260.207" offset="1144202">Yes, Your Honor and we concede that had that liquidating distribution taken place before the 21st there would not be Section 16 (b) liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.974" offset="1179206">We concede that on the authority of the Reliance Electric case.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.074" offset="1203657">Now then, this case began when respondent sought a declaratory judgment in the Federal District Court because it wished to liquidate and dissolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.510" offset="1241377">That Court on what it considered equitable considerations found for respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.130" offset="1259872">The Ninth Circuit opinion affirmed, but in the process rejected all of the arguments that had been made by the respondent and they said, among other things, that there was sufficient cooperation between the parties prior to the purchase such as, it could give rise to the possibility of obtaining inside information at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.243" offset="1348270">They also said that between the purchase date and the sale date that there was an opportunity to engage in speculative abuse and they went on to add, that it was the very kind of speculative abuse with which the statute was designed to cope.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.542" offset="1421518">I would like to just stress a few brief factual items in the appendix on the first of those two points, the pre-purchase cooperation because Provident’s brief at page 38 states that it is undisputed that negotiations only involve in evaluation of Provident's assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.040" offset="1487451">Not only is there nothing in the record to support that, but there is, indeed items or there are not any items in the record to support the contrary inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.538" offset="1521515">I would call your attention to page A41 in the record where Mr. Haskel (ph) of Dillon, Read, appearing before the Department of Corporations of California on the 25th of September, points out that Provident had hired Dillon, Read the previous September to explore possibilities and that they went into a great detail with a number of these companies and “examined” all of these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.680" offset="1638021">They then settled upon Foremost as the most likely participant in a transaction to provide liquidity to its shareholders and on A46 they go on to say, Mr. Haskel does, that we think the deal is fair because quality of the securities that we are getting, that is to say petitioners’ securities, is of sufficient quality and condition where we think that they represent a fair marketable security for the Provident shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.951" offset="1743137">And then on A74 the Chief Executive Officer of Provident observes in an affidavit that when the Foremost partnership, if you will, or deal had been decided as the most promising, “there followed throughout the late summer and early fall intense negotiations between Foremost and Provident.”</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="428.883" offset="1818892">What page did you say that was?</text>

            <label>Mr. Morton Moskin</label>
            <text syncTime="430.527" offset="1825475">That last was an affidavit at page A74, Mr. Dillon Warren’s affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.981" offset="1867271">The Ninth Circuit relied, I think, on two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.742" offset="1882318">First, it purported to find legislative history to support its conclusion in respect to the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.817" offset="1910635">There are a number of answers to this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.845" offset="1918680">Perhaps the most compelling is that this Court in Reliance Electric said that the legislative history does not explain the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.143" offset="1951908">Moreover, neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals in the Stella case found any legislative history that bore on the explanation of the proviso back in 1956 and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has submitted amicus briefs to this Court in Reliance and earlier to the Second Circuit Court in Stella, found some scratch of legislative history to the contrary to support petitioners’ contention here.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.904" offset="2058906">In addition to which, the dissent in the Stella case by Judge Hanks (ph) was one that conceded that there was no applicable legislative history in respect to the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.076" offset="2103627">It is an interesting point to note that Judge Hanks in his dissent concluded that the principal reason for his judgment that the proviso required that there would be a purchase subsequent to becoming a 10% stockholder was of that, in his mind, was clearly required in respective directors and officers, a position that Mr. Chief Justice Burger found in error three years later when he sat and decided in the Second Circuit for Unanimous Court, in the case of Adler against Klawans.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.908" offset="2238941">Moreover, Judge Wallace himself in the Ninth Circuit, I think, was a little inconsistent on this legislative history point because when he came to consider the meaning of “at the time of purchase” and “at the time of sale,” he decided that in respect to the sale, “sale” meant “simultaneously with” rather than ‘prior to.”</text>
            <text syncTime="556.259" offset="2328385">Therefore, he looked to the purposes of the statute rather than to the legislative history to define the same words, both at the time of purchase and sale, differently in respect to the purchase and in respect to the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.165" offset="2387944">It is also interesting that neither Provident nor Gulf &amp; Western, in the case that was decided last week in the Seventh Circuit, saw fit to urge the point about this proviso and the meaning of both at the time of purchase and sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.270" offset="2448443">It was never argued in the Ninth Circuit by either party and in the Gulf &amp; Western case in the Seventh Circuit, it was only after the Provident case was decided in the Ninth Circuit that supplementary papers were submitted by the Gulf &amp; Western and consequently, by Allis-Chalmers to support the then novel theory of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.679" offset="2522004">And, incidentally, the Seventh Circuit has found still another view of the meaning of these words both at the time of purchase and sale, a meaning which I suggest and believe is at odds with the teaching of this Court in the Reliance Electric case.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.587" offset="2609671">Staying for a moment with the legislative history, I would like to elude to footnote 13 in this Court’s recent decision in Blue Chip where it is said of another party, but I think equally applicable in respect to Provident that they seek reinsertion of language into the Act that Congress had before it, but deleted prior to passage, that is the very end of footnote 13 in Blue Chip.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.299" offset="2708519">So, we have in respect of legislative history something that Gulf &amp; Western and Provident emphasized different aspects of the alleged legislative history in respect of and that neither the Ninth nor the Seventh Circuit agreed on as to what it might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.849" offset="2758674">The second reason that the Ninth Circuit found, that there was no liability in this case, was based upon some language in this Court’s decision in Kern County.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.034" offset="2803500">The language was that they could not have been inside information obtained from substantial stock holdings that did not yet exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.458" offset="2841116">The Second Circuit in American Standard against Crane said, and I trust and hope that they are correct, that the Kern County decision was sui generis to a defensive merger situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.140" offset="2903915">in any event, there is ample reason in the statute to conclude that in a factual situation, such as ours at least, that there is no requirement that there would be substantial stock holdings at the time of the purchase or neither at the time of a purchase or a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.661" offset="2973923">You remember, earlier, I spoke about the statute defining contract to buy and a contract to sell as including purchases and sales and surely, a director or an officer could buy himself a contract without ever obtaining an equity position and still liability would attach under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.654" offset="3225952">I believe you are absolutely correct and I agree with that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.298" offset="3260538">I think, hopefully, it has been established that in this case there was at least an ambiguity in what the key statutory words mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.463" offset="3293139">That being so, it is appropriate to look to the statute as a whole and to consider the results of the alternative constructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.969" offset="3323232">And I suggest that the one that best carries out rather than defeats the statutory purposes is the one that should be adapted.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.517" offset="3357400">I would like to offer a few illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.616" offset="3369835">Under the Ninth and Seventh Circuit views, if within six months there was a purchase of 50% of the stock of an issuer and all of it was sold within that time at a profit, there will be no liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.547" offset="3429498">Similarly, if 9.9% of the stock had been acquired and then an addition 40% had been acquired and then all of it had been sold within the same six-month period, again, there will be no liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.959" offset="3479131">And yet, if you added one share before the sale, there would be liability for the profit of that one share.</text>

            <text syncTime="850.235" offset="3504313">Of course, if the sale were deferred so that it took place in seven months rather than six, there would be no liability?</text>

          <turn speaker="morton_moskin" startTime="857.154" stopTime="987.722">
            <label>Mr. Morton Moskin</label>
            <text syncTime="857.154" offset="3531898">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.812" offset="3534615">The statute is arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.150" offset="3539944">It is designed to deter and I think the purposes of deterrence, the court -- the Congress, as a matter of fact concluded that they had to evaluate on the one hand the beneficial purposes of the statute and also on the other, the beneficial purposes of long-term investments and concluded that a six-month cut off would be appropriate to meet both of those countervailing objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.443" offset="3633149">In each of these cases that I have postulated, the director or officer would be liable, at least under the Doctrine of Adler against Klawans.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.952" offset="3659167">That was a case in which the defendant bought stock, 60 days later became a director, and then within six months of the purchase sold the shares and the Second Circuit found liability should attach because of the purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.171" offset="3728026">And as a matter of fact, in that case Mr. Chief Justice Burger wrote that “at some moment before making a sale of stock, the insider was in an official position which he could have used to influence the sale price.”</text>
            <text syncTime="918.236" offset="3776300">That brings me to what I think is the appropriate interpretation of this statute, to with that it does not matter whether you acquire this information before or after the initial transaction so long as it exists prior to the closing transaction, the second of the two transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="957.958" offset="3935124">I think, if you consider the language in Adler and other places to the effect that the theory here is the director, officer or the beneficial holder is a fiduciary and look to common law concepts, it should not matter whether the fiduciary abuses this trust before or after he becomes a fiduciary so long as the abuse of trust has taken place prior to the point when the sale occurred and the profit was realized.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.435" offset="4165106">The legislative history makes clear that once you get to 10%, and at one point it was 5% that they were talking about, that you have the potential to control for manipulation that justifies your being treated the same as a director or officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.277" offset="4676479">In addition to that, the Ninth Circuit Court found the potential perspective of abuse in this very case both before, as I said earlier, in respect to the intense negotiations and the cooperation between the parties and subsequent when it said the assets in the Provident passed on to Foremost, included a large bundle of real estate and some relatively illiquid securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.878" offset="4778879">That real estate was such that it could have required, and Provident would have known this better than anybody else, substantial expenditures of cash to develop that property.</text>

            <label>Mr. Noble K. Gregory</label>
            <text syncTime="1813.311" offset="7356538">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.957" offset="7375137">I would like to start with emphasizing a factual point, although it is not crucial to the main argument, but it came up and I think it is very important in this case, at least from the so-called Kern County argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.034" offset="7427487">Provident was never a fiduciary of this corporation, Foremost-McKesson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.509" offset="7453400">It was only a creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.349" offset="7464685">All it had acquired were convertible debentures which are covered by Section 16 (b) because of their convertible nature, but I think it is important to understand that a person coming under 16 (b) as a beneficial owner technically is not always a fiduciary, and this is a perfect example of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.403" offset="7540963">The relationship is very clearly pointed out in many of the cases of a convertible debenture owner is that of a creditor and all they had was the information after they became a credit that a creditor normally would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.891" offset="7598850">Now, they had knowledge of their own assets of course, but that was not knowledge that they received as a result of the relationship, which brings me to what I think is the key provision in Section 16 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.202" offset="7652140">For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by a beneficial owner that is more than a 10% stockholder, director or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.755" offset="7718386">I think that is the key to interpreting the so-called proviso or exemption that the Section 16 (b) shall not be construed to cover any transaction were such beneficial owner, that is the more than 10% stockholder, was not such both at the time of the purchase and the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.037" offset="7811487">Now, Foremost attempts to make a great deal of statement in the Reliance Electric case that there is no legislative history of the proviso, and that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.587" offset="7857671">There is very legislative history of the proviso, but it even goes so far as to take that out of context because what the opinion says that although there may be, I am not putting, I am paraphrasing, no legislative history of the proviso, nonetheless that does not justify the parting from the clear purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.770" offset="7942412">I will read what the Court said so I would not unfairly paraphrase it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.304" offset="7956519">“The proviso cannot be disregarded simply on the ground that it may be inconsistent with our assessment, the Court’s assessment of the wholesome purposes of the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.105" offset="8003748">Now, more important that, as I suggest, it is the legislative history of the statute and nobody could deny it, and this purpose clause, I think, exemplifies that legislative history and it is helpful as applied to the facts of the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.497" offset="8073338">Both the Seventh Circuit and the Ninth Circuit had gone into it at length and I would not go into the detail, but I think I can clearly state with confidence that it shows that Congress was concerned with the use of the inside information by one who is a substantial stockholder before, and I emphasize there the before, he had made a purchase or an acquisition or before with the intent to sell at a quick profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.857" offset="8186710">Now, I realize that it took the intent language out of the statute and put in a rule of thumb, but the point and the purpose of the statute which is still in its purpose clause which was added when it took out the rule and put in the rule of thumb, or before he sold at a high price with the expectation of making a quick repurchase at a lower price, both of these, as the Seventh Circuit points out, are one ends of a swing and that is what we are talking about, a short-swing transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.824" offset="8322651">It shows, in other words, that the aim of Section 16 (b) was to discourage large stockholders, and I am only talking for the moment about stockholders, from making quick profits by entering into the short-swing transaction because of inside information received by reasons of their relationship to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.896" offset="8426932">That is the proviso which was interpreted in Kern County Land, and I will not paraphrase that and I will try not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.205" offset="8464130">In Kern County Land, this Court pointed out that the aim of that statute is the misuse of information obtained after the acquisition of substantial stockholdings, not purchases “based on inside information obtained from stockholdings that did not yet exist.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.949" offset="8551170">Now, that is the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.198" offset="8560156">Certainly, as I said a moment ago, Provident had knowledge of its own assets, but it did not have that knowledge as a result of any relationship to Foremost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.302" offset="8628492">Now, Mr. Moskin in his brief before the Court of Chambers on the tail of hearts, I should say, and any statute does not apply to everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.507" offset="8669348">There are always situations where it is not going to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.414" offset="8680946">That was recognized clearly in Reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.414" offset="8692963">It is recognized by some of the questions from the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.376" offset="8712816">Obviously, the statute never applies if a stockholder never gets more than 9%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.120" offset="8735803">He can speculate all he wants as far as 16 (b) is concerned, as long as he never gets more than 9% or he can wait for the six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.981" offset="8779271">There are a lot of other things he can do and some of the things he can do under the statute and under the purpose is, acquire information, not as a result of his relationship to the corporation, but for a (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.006" offset="8847399">There were provisions in the, and I think that again goes back to the legislative history, their original provisions or early provisions would have prohibited that because he might have a relationship not to the corporation by stockholding, but by some other relations, and get the inside information and make a killing and, of course, there are remedies for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.409" offset="8936946">Congress did not stop the 16 (b), but 16 (b) cannot be made into a device to solve all problems of inside information or the misuse them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.047" offset="8975503">It is only designed by its very terms and its purpose to prevent the unfair use of the inside information arising by reason of the relationship with the corporation to the person making the short-swing transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.390" offset="9064842">I think I would like to go on now to the other ground, but I would like first to make one point which I think should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.077" offset="9095666">Mr. Moskin keeps making a great deal of the fact that I did not argue this point strenuously in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.568" offset="9121580">He says we did not make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.516" offset="9125341">We made it, but we did not urge it orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.143" offset="9135895">The reason, I think, is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.721" offset="9142164">We had a conflict with the Second Circuit if we went on that ground, and although, I am highly honored to be arguing the case here, my client is less than happy of the expense..</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.678" offset="9182079">I, naturally, tried to win on the ground which I thought would end the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.192" offset="9208097">But the potential for speculative abuse point is the main argument that I have made in the Ninth Circuit and, that based on the Kern County Land case I think fits this case very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.924" offset="9258984">It does not fit to a T, it is not a white horse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.832" offset="9270687">There never are any, but there are two facts that both the Ninth Circuit in rejecting it and Mr. Moskin tends to brush over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.367" offset="9308826">The most important one is the one I started with, this lack of any fiduciary relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.222" offset="9328261">This was not stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.467" offset="9337247">The Ninth Circuit opinion treats Provident as a stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.965" offset="9359190">Now, as I say, I do not deny that 16 (b) applies because of the convertible nature, but that is the only reason it applies not because Provident went out to buy stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.939" offset="9407046">Provident went out to sell assets as a part of the liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.073" offset="9423660">The corporation was going into liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.324" offset="9432646">The sole purpose of this transaction, as far as Provident was concerned and this is an objective fact, was to liquidate this corporation to avoid tax consequences and this was a legitimate method of complying with the tax laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2360.171" offset="9544032">I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.913" offset="9546958">I did not bother to check who the particular stockholders were, but they were all heirs and that is all I can tell you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.217" offset="9588231">It may be in the record, I am just not sure, but they were heirs of the Crocker estate and formed a family corporation to hold certain assets of the Crocker family and they found tax problems and they wanted to liquidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.748" offset="9650298">Now, their desire to liquidate was to sell the assets and they hired Dillon Reed to find somebody that would buy the assets and the only people that were satisfactory were Foremost and they thought they had an arrangement with Foremost whereby they could avoid any problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.409" offset="9728979">Other problems arose, if they had carried it out as they originally designed, unfortunately they did not, they would have no 16 (b) problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.762" offset="9770357">I would like to mention too that although there is an agenda in which at the bottom is a mention of 16 (b), the impression I am sure Mr. Moskin did not intend to give, that this was all designed to get around 16 (b) is not borne out by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.726" offset="9830230">All it was is that apparently, somebody mentioned there might be a 16 (b) problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.899" offset="9846948">The case came up on summary judgment so we do not have a full detail of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.392" offset="9868891">Now, the other point is, again, the convertible debentures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.399" offset="9892923">That was the condition to the whole agreement to sell the assets to Foremost, and I am not trying to be a picayune in calling it a sale of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.629" offset="9933883">I realize that, under one possible normal construction of any sale of assets for a stock it is a technical purchase, but that is the whole point I believe occurred that where you have something that technically may be a purchase if it is not within the potential for speculative abuse, then you look at the realistic transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.704" offset="10038164">Now, the day after the agreement to sell, the corporation went into liquidation and a corporation in liquidation does not normally engage in speculation and, under California law, it is not permitted to engage in speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.218" offset="10120189">The liquidation of the corporation was never a stockholder of Foremost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.383" offset="10140878">And, as a debenture holder, Provident was only a creditor, as I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.392" offset="10168881">There was, as the District Court pointed out and I should say this is the ground on which the District Court decided the case, that it was not a potential for speculative abuse, Foremost made no claim in the Trial Court, as the District Court pointed out, that provident derived inside information profit or advantage “from its all but monetary status as an insider of Foremost.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.782" offset="10274416">Foremost claims that Provident had inside information, I think I covered that, it was inside information that had by reason of the fact that it was selling it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.209" offset="10316212">Now, even if the information as its own assets could have given Provident an opportunity, it was not an opportunity that arose out of the stockholdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.116" offset="10375771">Justice Powell, I think, asked about the other ground that was considered in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.081" offset="10403670">The point there, again, we must look at this case in view of the facts and the purposes and I think, as Kern County applies, the agreement was very clear that the time and date of sale was after the, I believe it was October 28 was to be the date of sale, I think this date is wrong, and before that, more than half of these debentures were distributed to the stockholders of Provident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.914" offset="10542955">Now, there are cases of both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.054" offset="10567510">There are cases that Mr. Moskin relies on that you disregard all, but the contract controls, but I submit if we follow the teaching of Kern County that you look at the transaction realistically where there is no potential for speculative abuse and you also look at it technically from the contract law point of view, there was no sale until all of these conditions had passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.402" offset="10696972">Now, there are two other arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.576" offset="10705645">Neither one of which, I think Mr. Moskin misspoke himself, he said the Ninth Circuit passed on and neither the Trial Court nor the Ninth Circuit passed on the other two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.354" offset="10740754">I think they are perhaps not ones that this Court does not want to pass on, but I do want to mention that there are questions of whether this comes within the exception for a liquidating agent under California law when this liquidation plan was adapted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.257" offset="10820375">The directors became liquidating agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.176" offset="10832078">They held the stock only for the beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.096" offset="10851722">In addition, under California law once they passed a dividend which they did in distributing dividend the debentures in Foremost evolved upon the beneficiaries and there was no beneficial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.040" offset="10927477">Those are matters primarily of California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.611" offset="10937821">Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals passed on and I hope they never have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.275" offset="10960391">I think that the other arguments are sufficient and I suggest that this Court should follow the clear learning of the legislative history and the clear purpose of this statute and if so, they will find that this does not come within Section 16 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="2824.833" offset="11402697">I would say involuntary in one term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.846" offset="11418683">That was an involuntary conversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.205" offset="11428192">There was a voluntary aspect to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.941" offset="11439059">There was an option agreement which was completely voluntary in the same sense that this was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.696" offset="11466122">They did not even have to enter into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.469" offset="11473227">Once they entered into it, of course, they were bound by it, but the only involuntary thing that Occidental could not do anything about this was the conversion, but this Court had two sales in the Kern County case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.115" offset="11527771">One was the conversion and the other was the option agreement which was entered into willingly, but under the duress of the commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.110" offset="11563715">But, I could hardly call that involuntary any more than Mr. Moskin seems to think that we are claiming that Provident involuntarily sold its assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.253" offset="11616378">It did not involuntarily sell its assets and in the sense that it could have not taken this offer and not liquidate it, it was voluntary, but the form of the transaction was not the one it chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.527" offset="11673430">It was the one that it had to accept under the exigencies of the moment, Your Honor, which I think are equally applicable to the Kern case and this case.</text>
