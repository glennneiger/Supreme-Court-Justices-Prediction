            <text syncTime="25.641" offset="176193">These cases are here on writ certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.526" offset="195733">They present the question of whether the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development must file an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environment Policy Act, prior to allowing a disclosure statement filed with the secretary pursuant to the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act in order to become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.706" offset="288416">The District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma ruled that the secretary must file such a statement and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.188" offset="322375">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.145" offset="338257">NEPA instructs all federal agencies to comply with it's impact statement requirement “to the fullest extent possible.”</text>
            <text syncTime="75.213" offset="374515">Where a clear and unavoidable conflict in statutory authority exists, however, NEPA must yield.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.428" offset="403354">Here we find that the secretary cannot comply with a duty to allow disclosure statements to become effective within 30 days after the filing and the same -- and simultaneously prepare an environment impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.753" offset="464690">Accordingly the impact statement requirement is inapplicable to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.758" offset="484647">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and these cases are remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.490" offset="511606">Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</text>
