            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.020" offset="109718">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.741" offset="128631">Petitioner revealed, in his Federal Income Tax returns that he was a professional gambler.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.345" offset="154962">He was subsequently indicted and tried on a gambling conspiracy charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.697" offset="176382">His returns were introduced in evidence despite his Fifth Amendment claim of privilege against compulsory self-incrimination that petitioner had voluntarily revealed his status as a gambler.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.894" offset="233225">Although he was compelled by law to file the tax returns, he could have claimed the privilege with respect specific disclosures at the time of filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.046" offset="277842">In these circumstance, we think the general rule applies, that privilege must be claimed prior to disclosure in the absence of some factor that deprives the individual of a free choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.941" offset="333431">As there was no such factor in this case, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.421" offset="359344">Mr. Justice Marshall filed an opinion, concurring in the judgment in which Mr. Justice Brennan joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.583" offset="387974">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
