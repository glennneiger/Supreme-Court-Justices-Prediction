            <text syncTime="18.722" offset="178169">Mr. Catz you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Catz</label>
            <text syncTime="23.276" offset="196454">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.573" offset="205545">The petitioners are here on a writ of certiorari to the California Court of Appeals, Second Appellant District.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.949" offset="231145">This case raises the question of whether a state statutory scheme, which prohibits domestic employers from employing aliens not entitled to lawful residence, is unconstitutional under the Doctrine of Federal Preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.667" offset="286002">In 1971, the California Legislature enacted the Labor Code, Section 2805.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.578" offset="309617">This statute was enacted in recognition by the California Legislature that the increasing numbers of illegal aliens coming into California were imposing severe hardships on the state's economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.901" offset="354861">The statutes provides in part and the statute is reproduced in our brief, petitioners' brief at page three, that no employer shall knowingly employ an alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in United States, if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.482" offset="421212">In addition to the above provision, 2805 imposes misdemeanor penalties on employers who utilize the Illegal Labor and in addition creates a private cause of action against employers, which allows employees to go into the Local Superior Court to enjoin employers' use illegal labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.403" offset="500938">Now, the facts in this case are that petitioners, domestic farm workers from California were employed by respondents' farm labor contractors for approximately three months during the summer, harvest season of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.857" offset="554750">In September of 1972, respondents laid petitioners off on the grounds that respondents had a surplus of labor and thus had no work available for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.865" offset="598740">As a direct consequence of being laid off and believing that respondents were employing illegal labor, petitioners commenced this action in the Local Superior Court of Santa Barbara, California, pursuant to Section 2805, alleging that respondents were open and notorious employers of illegal labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.379" offset="668853">In fact, at one point in our complaint, petitioners alleged that during the four-month period in 1972, the United States Boarder Patrol visited the work site of respondents and apprehended over 40 illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.542" offset="729457">Among other things, petitioners sought their own job reinstatement, damages and a permanent injunction against respondent's willful and continued employment of illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.004" offset="775328">After full evidentiary hearing on a motion for preliminary injunction in which petitioners sought to present evidence of respondents’ use of illegal labor, respondents filed a demur, challenging the validity of Section 2805 on the ground that statute was preempted by the Federal Immigration Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.491" offset="845232">The Trial Court granted respondents' demur and declared Section 2805 unconstitutional on several grounds, but specifically on the ground that the statute was preempted by Federal Immigration Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.365" offset="892774">Petitioners subsequently appealed this ruling to the California Court of Appeals, which it affirmed and the Cal. Supreme Court denied petitioners’ request for discretionary review.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.148" offset="935929">A petition for cert was sought to this Court and granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.867" offset="954737">At issue here today is the constitutionality of a state’s statutory scheme, fashioned to protect citizens and lawful resident workers from the unfair competition caused by the influx of illegal aliens into California.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.786" offset="1006459">That the problems of illegal aliens is one of great public importance, of course, is not in dispute today.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.905" offset="1026939">This Court took the opportunity to outline the scope of the problem just last term in its series of U.S. Boarder Patrol Cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.555" offset="1057555">In California, the problems of illegal aliens is particularly huge, since California -- because of California’s close proximity to the Mexican border.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.323" offset="1096634">Illegal aliens go virtually unchecked producing drastic effects, particularly on low income and minority residents who suffer substantial job displacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.219" offset="1136131">In addition, illegal aliens create a substantial wage (Inaudible) into Mexico, adversely affecting the local economies.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.362" offset="1296732">You are talking about the Superior Court rather than the Court of Appeals?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Catz</label>
            <text syncTime="300.881" offset="1306867">That is Correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="301.754" stopTime="303.250">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="301.754" offset="1310316">How about the Court of Appeals?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_s_catz" startTime="303.250" stopTime="440.481">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Catz</label>
            <text syncTime="303.250" offset="1316272">I do not think the Court of Appeals really addressed that because the case went up on a demur, it was just considering the statutes, the validity of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.080" offset="1355664">Thus we submit that without a favorable adjudication of the constitutionality of Section 2805, the continued employment of illegal aliens who may render jobless thousands of lawful resident workers in California, in addition, domestic employers who by long time business practice intentionally seek out and rely on illegal labor will profit at the sake of the economy and will do so with total impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.140" offset="1455870">At this time I think it might be helpful if petitioners outline for the Court, how the state statutory scheme operates and what obligations it imposes on domestic California employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.016" offset="1507383">In 1971, when the statute was enacted, it imposed the primary enforcement obligations of the statute on the California Labor Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.055" offset="1547507">Pursuant to Section 2805, the California Labor Commissioner promulgated a comprehensive set of regulations interpreting Section 2805 and the regulations are found at pages 1A through 3A of petitioners' reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.921" offset="1615008">First, the California Labor Commissioner defines an alien not entitled to lawful residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.863" offset="1642802">The Commissioner defines an alien entitled to lawful residence as any non-United States’ citizen who possesses documentation issued by the Federal Government, authorizing him or her to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.527" offset="1689405">Thus, when an applicant and employee seeks employment and an employer has an express obligation to inquire whether the applicant be either a citizen or an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.166" offset="1731932">If the applicant employee claims to be a citizen of the United States he must sign a declaration to that effect under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.328" offset="1760562">If an applicant claims to be an alien, he must then display proper Federal Documents that are issued by the United States Department of Labor, attesting to his employment certification and now this must be done within three days of commencement of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.029" offset="1823465">Employer liability then attaches when he fails to take the steps I have just described and an employee is found to be -- later on an employee is found to be unlawful resident alien.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="440.481" offset="1865261">Mr. Catz, the statute is conditional.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.730" offset="1886263">It says no employer shall knowingly employ an alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.778" offset="1906430">if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.445" offset="1925134">Has it been any administrative definition of that condition?</text>

            <text syncTime="470.074" offset="1983648">That is at page 3A, petitioners' reply brief.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_s_catz" startTime="473.664" stopTime="716.506">
            <label>Mr. Robert S. Catz</label>
            <text syncTime="473.664" offset="1997963">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.974" offset="2003187">Now, Section 2805 requires that use of illegal labor must have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers as you have pointed out Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.034" offset="2035475">Adverse effect arises whenever illegal labor is employed in an occupation not deemed to be a shortage of labor in that field by the Secretary of Labor and the United States Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.861" offset="2090750">Now, the Department of Labor promulgates and lists those areas of employment in this country where there is a shortage of labor and those regulations are found at 29C of our Section 60 at sect.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.749" offset="2158250">In addition, adverse effect is defined -- arises whenever an employer pays an illegal worker less than the prevailing minimum wage, either State or Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.033" offset="2203390">Thus for purposes of a hypothetical, physicians is one occupation or profession in which the Secretary of Labor has deemed that there is a shortage in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.535" offset="2253441">So that if an illegal alien came to California and was engaged as a brain surgeon and was employed by the California Hospital, as long as the California hospital paid him in excess of the minimum wage, the hospital employer would not be subject to liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.724" offset="2322195">In the case we have here today, there is a surplus of agricultural labor and in other words, liability attached against the respondents because the Secretary of Labor of the United States did not list agriculture as a field in which there was a shortage of labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.238" offset="2408294">Where Federal and State Laws have regulated in the same area, this Court is evolved two basic approaches in determining the constitutional preemptive ability of the state law in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.992" offset="2455315">The first approach or test is often referred to as occupation and that renders any state attempt to regulate a Federal area invalid, even though it maybe agreed that the states’ scheme does not impair, but enhances and aids in the achievement of a Federal goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.249" offset="2524278">The Lower Court in this case held and this is the area that we complain off, is that 2805 was an attempt by the State of California to legislate in the area of immigration and the Lower Court concluded that Congress by the mere enactment of a Comprehensive Immigration Nationality Act, that of 1972, thus had expressed its intent by just the mere enactment to have occupied the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.901" offset="2630858">Now, we believe that the Lower Court erred because any judicial preemption decision in this case, based on the occupation test, should not have been applied and we say that because, first, there is no textual evidence in the Immigration Nationality Act, where its legislative history or even other Federal Laws, the Congress specifically intended to preclude the states from enacting limited statutes such as 2805.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.319" offset="2740572">We submit that Section 2805 is not an Immigration Law, but a law that regulates the labor practices of domestic employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.397" offset="2772859">We will concede that the statute's long range affect thus have an indirect and incidental effect on immigration, but the statute does not regulate immigration policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.084" offset="2815596">Instead, the statute prescribed a specific employment practice of domestic employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.393" offset="2836912">Section 2805 and the simple many regulations issued by the California Labor Commissioner, use Federal Immigration and Labor Law definitions to effectuate a Local Labor Law Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.988" offset="2883305">The statute in no way alters Federal determinations concerning entry into the United States and in what terms and conditions entry maybe made.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.428" offset="2917055">Section 2805 merely precludes the knowing employment by California employers of those individuals defined by Federal Law Administrative Practice is not authorized to work in United States by virtue --</text>

            <text syncTime="1236.553" offset="5049483">I think a final word perhaps needs to be mentioned about the anti Harboring Provisions of the Immigration Nationality Act and they are at page 7 of our rely brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.035" offset="5099429">This is the only specific Federal Statute which respondents argue, poses a potential conflict with Section 2805 and that is Section 274 (a) (3) of the Act and this Section provides that any person who “willfully or knowing conceals, harbors or shields from detection any alien not duly admitted or not lawfully entitled to enter and reside within the Unites States shall be guilty of a felony.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.138" offset="5207890">Now, to prevent the interpretation that employment per se would constitute a crime under this Section and I emphasize the word this Section, Congress added the following proviso, “Provided, however, that for purposes of this Section, employment, including the usual and normal practices used in the employment shall not be deemed to constitute harboring.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.861" offset="5286779">Now, this statute while exempting employment pre se from the crime of harboring, does not purport to grant an absolute exemption from criminal or civil sanctions for employers of illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.054" offset="5331501">There may well be given set effects in which the knowing employment of illegal aliens, particularly where an element of concealment or procurement is involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.736" offset="5386254">Now, there has been no specific judicial interpretation of 274 (a) (3) I believe by this Court, but examination of the legislative history reveals that the Congressional intent was to protect the innocent and unknowing employer from prosecution under this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.850" offset="5450724">So we would argue the 274 (a) (3) indicates no more than Congressional silence regarding the prohibition against the intentional and knowing employment of illegal aliens.</text>
