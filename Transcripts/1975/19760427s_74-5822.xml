            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73675">In 74-5822 Hampton versus the United States, there is not a court opinion, I have written an opinion in which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice White have joined, Mr. Justice Powell has written an opinion concurring in the judgment which Mr. Justice Blackmun has joined and the by virtue of the combined reasoning in those opinions the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eight circuit in this case is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.770" offset="192689">In the case, petitioner was convicted of selling heroin to federal undercover agents in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.563" offset="219856">The government's evidence shows that petitioner had told Hutton that he needed money and knew where he could get some heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.563" offset="251830">Hutton who was an informant for the drug enforcement administration told petitioner that he could find a buyer, Hutton contacted the drug agents to setup a heroin sale and the second sale was arranged by the agents at the conclusion of which petitioner was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.238" offset="322570">At trial petitioner claimed that the substance which he sold had been supplied by Hutton.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.698" offset="344408">The petitioner requested a jury instruction to the effect that if the narcotics had been supplied by the informant, petitioner must be acquitted regardless of his predisposition to commit the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.534" offset="395713">The trial court refused this instruction and the court of appeals for the eight circuit affirmed relying on our opinion in United States against Russell, decided two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.627" offset="440121">And we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals that Chief Justice Mr. Justice White had joined my opinion, Mr. Justice Powell has written a concurring opinion joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun,  Mr. Justice Brennan who is joined by Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Marshall has dissented, and Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
