            <text syncTime="111.475" offset="549239">I shall not try to maintain the level of interest or even to make comparisons with respect to the very challenging patent case, the Court has just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.406" offset="612978">Although I will admit my colleagues and I have thought of several ways in which it might be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.378" offset="652893">I would also state that I have made arrangements with the marshal to reserve approximately ten minutes for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.116" offset="691763">This case began in 1969, on December 4th in the afternoon preceding the December 5, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.866" offset="738783">Stockholder’s meetings of TSC Industries, Inc. and National Industries, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.042" offset="767518">That was a swap of the assets of TSC for securities of National Industries which were passed through the holders of the TSC stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.062" offset="847557">The issue now, before this Court is whether on the summary judgment record and under the limitations of Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Seventh Circuit could properly find that the omission of four factual matters from the 80 page proxy statement was so serious, so important, as to make the entire proxy statement violative of Rule 14a-9.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.021" offset="991440">14a-9 is a rule promulgated by the SEC which prohibits the making of a misleading or false statement of a material fact and likewise --</text>

            <text syncTime="233.942" offset="1039087">It does seem to me that there maybe one common element.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.045" offset="1059463">Although, perhaps you may not see it the way between the prior case and yours and that is – an inquiry perhaps is to – what is the question of fact and what is the question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.282" offset="1112439">Is there any generally accepted standard in the Courts of Appeal or in this Court as to whether a question of materiality such as the Court of Appeals and the District Court passed on here is generally a question of law or a question of fact?</text>

          <turn speaker="joseph_n_morency_jr" startTime="267.609" stopTime="294.693">
            <label>Mr. Joseph N. Morency, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="267.609" offset="1173774">Mr. Justice, I think that is rather well understood and I think a question of materiality is a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.738" offset="1206271">It may become a question of law when the Court finds that all reasonable men would agree on whether a matter is so important or not..</text>
            <text syncTime="287.804" offset="1254545">And, this is the basis on which the Seventh Circuit decided these various questions on the summary judgment record.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="294.693" offset="1282130">Judge McLaren’s holding was in a fact that it was reasonably debatable so he denied summary judgment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_n_morency_jr" startTime="301.159" stopTime="1105.774">
            <label>Mr. Joseph N. Morency, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="301.159" offset="1307939">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.368" offset="1312850">Judge McLaren found that certain important facts were missing as to some matters, he found that key facts were hopelessly in dispute as to other matters and therefore he concluded that the requisite summary judgment finding could not be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.384" offset="1376903">That is that there were no material disputed issues of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.309" offset="1396547">He could not make such a finding and therefore he concluded he could not give plaintiff its partial summary judgment on issue of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.770" offset="1434372">Plaintiff sought that partial summary judgment on the issue of liability solely on the basis of Rule 14 or rather Section 14 of the 1934 Act in the SEC Proxy Rules promulgated there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.015" offset="1499365">Now, you are right Mr. Justice, I did not think of that connection, but primarily I think because the various Courts of Appeals who have considered the issue have so decided it.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.167" offset="1547952">We cited a number of cases to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.399" offset="1556939">One of which is the Johns Hopkins case, another which is Rogen against Ilikon.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.459" offset="1589121">When this case was filed, the complaint charged that this was a steal.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.548" offset="1617543">That National Industries inclusion with TSC Directors dominated by National Industries and had conspired together to sell off this valuable business of TSC at a grossly inadequate price.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.232" offset="1680237">However, there was no motion for a temporary restraining order in this case filed the day before the Shareholder’s meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.999" offset="1723286">After two and a half years of discovery, apparently, no fraud could be found and established and the plaintiff, a private holding company called Northway, Inc., filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability only, predicated entirely on omissions from the proxy statement with a single exception no longer material here and charged it under the proxy rule, as the proxy statement was rendered faintly defective because of these omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.797" offset="1878558">The Court of Appeals found and so did the District Court, that all of the required disclosures had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.364" offset="1912831">So the case was considered below on the question whether the omissions were of such magnitude and such seriousness as to render the proxy statement disclosures actually made on the required matters false or misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.482" offset="1977301">Once again, reference to Rule 14a-9.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.958" offset="1995169">These alleged omissions, serious omissions which really fell in to two areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.039" offset="2019515">One area related to the alleged control which plaintiff said National had over TSC and its influence over TSC in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.004" offset="2071342">The other related to an alleged manipulation of prices of the common stock of National Industries which by the way was not involved in the transaction at all of the national securities that were given to the TSC holders where the National Series B preferred stock and National warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.412" offset="2145007">Now, the Seventh Circuit in deciding the case followed almost religiously the position of an SEC Amicus brief filed with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.602" offset="2189729">They followed religiously on the omissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.847" offset="2202685">They did not follow the plaintiff’s claim that there was a failure to properly report control or a change in control but they did say that four omissions are serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.304" offset="2248557">The circuit still found within some finding, I think the circuit discovered that it had to redefine materiality and depart from the teaching of this Court in Mills and the holdings of other circuits such as the Second and Fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.263" offset="2324416">And they went ahead and defined materiality by reference to relevancy of a factual matter saying that it was sufficient as a required disclosure even if it was relevant only for some Stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.166" offset="2395992">Now, it is our position and we believe that the legislative history and the deciding cases support the position that Rule 14 a 9 which is the catch all is violated only when the omitted fact itself is material and its omission makes the disclosures in the proxy statement itself false or misleading in a material respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.640" offset="2521902">There are certain key facts which we refer to in our reply brief in which we believe put this case in a context which makes it much easier to analyze.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.435" offset="2569027">Admittedly, an 80 page proxy statement is not an easy document to digest or to analyze.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.557" offset="2593582">It is reproduced in full text in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.742" offset="2606330">We have 20 copies which do not meet the Court’s pending rule but which were printed for the Shareholders in ’69 which we are perfectly willing to deposit with the clerk in the interest of avoiding eyes drain for the Justices and their clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.085" offset="2667665">But, let us go back to the transaction and see what actually happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.735" offset="2694310">Unlike the finding in the Seventh Circuit and counter the position of the respondent here, this transaction was actually determined and defined by Blancke Noyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.257" offset="2756377">Blancke Noyes was an old TSC Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.663" offset="2773931">His history with TSC had edited by several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.715" offset="2790232">The first interest that National Industries ever had in I think February of ’69.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.226" offset="2812279">He is a partner in a prestigious investment banking firm and was is an investment banker of ability himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.009" offset="2847388">Both he and his wife were Stockholders in TSC.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.856" offset="2862748">It was his firm and he who analyzed proposed transaction as outlined by National Industries and its proposal and said it was not good enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.060" offset="2903603">He made a counter proposal which National Industries accepted without further discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.653" offset="2925964">And it was his counter proposal which became the exchange ratio in the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.417" offset="2956997">It was his firm that handled a 195,000-share public offering in the Spring of 1969 and it was his firm in the Fall of that year that handled the review of the transaction at the request of TSC and for the benefit of TSC Directors and Shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.346" offset="3048739">Now, how was the transaction adopted by this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="740.326" offset="3064622">Once again, we find that total absence of influence by National Industries, National had five Directors on this Board.None of those Directors voted on the October 16th meeting, the three who were present abstained.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.534" offset="3129510">The transaction and the resolutions in respect of it were adopted by the vote of four independent disinterested Directors, none of whom had any connection with National here I refer to Mr. Noyes, Mr. Schaeffer who was the Chief Executive Officer of the company, in fact although not in title, and Directors Deforrest and Charthman (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="783.748" offset="3238284">Now, what is the context in which these so called omissions must be viewed?</text>
            <text syncTime="788.559" offset="3257614">These ones that were so serious that they should allow the transaction to be upset.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.545" offset="3277468">First of all, it is clear that National Industries was not in control of TSC in the fall of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.023" offset="3311427">The District Court said that National’s alleged control was not established.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.380" offset="3328877">The Court of Appeals agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.464" offset="3337236">Therefore, on this summary judgment record, we say it is clear cut that National is not in control of TSC.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.442" offset="3377046">Secondly, the terms of exchange were determined not by National but by Blancke Noyes, the investment banker and TSC Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.082" offset="3415708">Certainly, the transaction itself as far as TSC is concerned is initiated as a result of resolutions adopted after the report of Mr. Noyes is received both in writing and orally by his fellow Directors at TSC with all the National nominees abstaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.797" offset="3506509">Now, what is in the proxy statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="853.551" offset="3517585">Well, at appendix 267, you will find that it is prominently and plainly disclosed that National owned 34% of the TSC stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.154" offset="3563979">That five of the ten Directors were National’s nominees.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.179" offset="3580070">Who these five persons were and what their jobs were at National Industries is also prominently and plainly disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.544" offset="3625523">The two of the omissions which the Court below said has a matter of law on the summary judgment record were so serious that reasonable matter would not differ on their importance related to the titles of Stanley Yarmuth and Charles Simonelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.364" offset="3708801">Yarmuth was the President and Chief Executive Officer of National Industries and Simonelli was the Director and Executive Vice President of National.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.038" offset="3747463">They became Directors of TSC.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.903" offset="3762927">When first elected, there were four National Directors out of a total board of ten.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.841" offset="3790721">And Yarmuth became the Chairman of the Board and Simonelli became the Chairman of the Executive Committee at TSC.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.397" offset="3836906">Yarmuth’s position is Chairman of the Board as per the bylaws Chief Executive Officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.925" offset="3863028">On the record here, it is plain that he never functioned as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.141" offset="3879851">His affidavit and the testimony made it perfectly clear that he did not even know he was the “Chief Executive Officer” until after the lawsuit was filed and discovery had begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.315" offset="3928543">As to Simonelli, the record is perfectly clear that this transaction was one in which the executive committee of this Board had no part whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.683" offset="3974101">So, his title as Chairman of an Executive Committee on which he and Yarmuth served along with a majority of three old TSC Directors could not be very important to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.903" offset="4030943">Yet, that is the kind of thing which at the urging of the SEC’s Lawyers, the Seventh Circuits had in disagreement with the District Judge who analyze this record carefully said was so serious, so material, so important that the proxy statement thereby violated the basic proxy rule as to omitted material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.411" offset="4124984">Now, we think that the Seventh Circuit arrived at its misconstruction of 14 a 9 fundamentally in three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.312" offset="4164586">First of all, they said correctly, we submit that the alleged control of TSC by National was not established on the summary judgment records, point one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.853" offset="4226757">Then they said that certain facts are persuasive indicators, and the phrases there is persuasive indicators of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.521" offset="4269389">Then they concluded that the proxy statement should have disclosed those suggestive facts which indicated a “substantial likelihood of control”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.007" offset="4335322">In brief, we suggested the Court that what they did was to confuse suggestive facts, soft information with the kind of hard information which the legislative history and the SEC’s own rules tell us is to be sought, printed and understood in a proxy statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.251" offset="4424348">Proxy statements are supposed to tell the facts the way they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.528" offset="4441484">Facts which are known, facts which are ascertainable not matter which is suggestive of a fact when the ultimate fact control has already been postulated by the Court as being not established on the summary judgment record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.407" offset="4508984">This is the kind and quality of nitpicking, frankly—</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.494" offset="4617340">Mr. Justice, we did not make a cross motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.446" offset="4629148">The reason we did not is evident from Judge McLaren’s order in memorandum opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.078" offset="4655688">There are frankly, some undisposed, undecided, unresolved important factual questions in this record today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.704" offset="4686094">There are questions on which despite the fact that counsel for both sides are here in full battle array, nobody can answer with accuracy and completeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.653" offset="4725905">So, we do not feel we are entitled of the summary judgment and we certainly submit they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.945" offset="4747117">But the Court of Appeals held they were in disagreement with Judge McLaren.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.818" offset="4766552">And the reason that we think the Court of Appeals made this confusing set of holdings lies in the fact that they gave the SEC’s Amicus brief a whole lot more credit than it was due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.862" offset="4814826">It was prepared by the Commission’s Lawyers who knew the least of all about the review of proxy statements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.707" offset="10926121">First, there is the substantial premium over current market values represented by the securities being offered to the TSC shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.640" offset="10981918">He found that that violation did not warrant summary judgment because he said there was no evidence in the record to show that the corrected value of the warrants and Mr. Noyes opinion fully explained, said those warrants were not worth the $5.00 and a quarter market value that was listed in the proxy statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.208" offset="11100201">It was his opinion that with the issuance of six times as many warrants, $3 million and instead of less than half a million, there would be a substantial decline to $3.50.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.359" offset="11460795">The reason for denial of summary judgment in the District Court on that ground was as matter of law.</text>
