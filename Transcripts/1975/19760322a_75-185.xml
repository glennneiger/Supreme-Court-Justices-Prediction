            <label>Mr. Gerry M. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="62.622" offset="353840">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.523" offset="357393">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.020" offset="371394">This case is here on petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.644" offset="389889">The question it poses as we see it is the following; Whether Wisconsin may, consistent with Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution, outlaw peaceful, concertedly refusals to work optional overtime in support of Worker Collective Bargaining Demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.983" offset="459270">A self-help pressure permitted under the balance of power is struck by Congress in the Federal Labor Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.992" offset="491244">The question arises on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.400" offset="504932">The company, a machine tool manufacturer within the Federal Labor Board’s jurisdiction, terminated its labor agreement with the Union in June of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.901" offset="542967">At that time, the parties had reached impasse on a number of the company’s demands for changes in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.977" offset="567208">One of these was insistence, the company’s insistence on increasing basic work day and work week from seven and one-half to eight hours a day and thirty-seven-one-half to forty hours a week where the commensurate reduction in over time pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.583" offset="625618">On March 1, 1972, while the parties were still in impasse on this and other issues, the company announced its decision to implement its work schedule demands unilaterally, just as it had previously changed other established working additions some months before.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.922" offset="687058">This time, the Union responded by holding a meeting on March 7 at which the membership voted to seek strike sanction from the International Union and unanimously resolved that no member should work overtime to find his work over seven-and-one-half hours a day or thirty-seven-one-half hours a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.314" offset="764589">Though the company continued to schedule overtime work thereafter, the membership resolution was observed by virtually all of the over 600 members over the next four months until the new contract was settled in late July.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.677" offset="817984">Faced with the Union’s counter to it self-help initiative, the company backed off from implementing its work day and work week demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.798" offset="850480">The impact of the Union’s overtime moratorium was to cause severe economic hardship to the company and its effort to deal with temporary pulse increases in production loads while the workers lost substantial additional earnings that they would have receive had the overtime been worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.574" offset="921638">For the past 17 years, K&amp;T employees, the company’s employees had worked the seven-and-one-half hour work day and thirty-seven one-half hour work week.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.011" offset="963329">They continued to do so throughout the period March through July 1972, in other words, doing over time moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.896" offset="994885">By custom and understanding as the commission found, Respondent Commission, none of these employees had been required to work daily or weekend overtime prior to the March 7 membership meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.965" offset="1047234">Admittedly, since acceptance of overtime assignments remained optional thereafter, no employee who concertedly refused to accept scheduled overtime, pursuant to the moratorium was even disciplined.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.954" offset="1103136">The union rejected the company proposal to settle the controversy by the company’s differing implementation of the new work schedules, if the Union would agree that all daily overtime would now become part of the regular work schedule and cannot be refused, except for reasons acceptable to supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.342" offset="1180668">On June 12, 1972, during the overtime moratorium but the same day that it commenced the present action, the company filed a charge with the NLRB, alleging in part that Union’s overtime moratorium restrained the employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights and violated its bargaining duty to the employer under Sections 8 (b) (1) and 3 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.410" offset="1280978">That charge was dismissed by the Board’s director on the ground that the overtime refusals were not violative of the Federal Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.844" offset="1314728">The director cited the 1960 decision of this Court in Insurance Agents International Union where various concerted interference with production on the job action were held permissible under the Act though assumed not to be protected from employer appraisal by Section 7 of the National Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.316" offset="1392573">In this case, in our case, the director made no determination as to whether K&amp;T employees lost that protection by collectively exercising the right to reject overtime work in the circumstances here.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.968" offset="1443146">However, the State Commission in the instant proceeding and later the Supreme Court held that the very same peaceful self-help activity permitted by the Board’s director breached the Wisconsin Labor Relations Statute which prohibits workers from engaging in any concerted effort to interfere with production, except by leaving the premises in an orderly manner for the purpose of going on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.487" offset="1553278">The Union’s defense of federal preemption was rejected by the state tribunals on grounds that the conduct was neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited by the Federal Statute and on the authority of this Court’s 1947 decision in Briggs-Stratton dealing with state jurisdiction to enjoin “quickie” strikes within the plenary power of the state to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.750" offset="1658291">That states the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.750" offset="1666336">On these facts, we desire to emphasize two of the arguments against state jurisdiction presented in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.406" offset="1704998">The first, that Briggs-Stratton is plainly distinguishable from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.367" offset="1728821">The second that Briggs-Stratton should be declared overruled or limited to its exact facts and of course the reason supportive of the latter reinforce the former.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.163" offset="1787962">The first point; without reaching any issue as to the current survival of any prior decision of this Court, we think state jurisdiction must yield simply because the quality of the conduct here is so different in kind from that which is hereto for ever been held subject to state prohibition in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.666" offset="1885974">Please contrast if --</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerry M. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="467.475" offset="1973223">I think physical obstruction of a plant creates a series of state interest a fortiori of course to trespass that amount of physical obstruction, the exercise of physical force in occupying the premises, I see nothing comparable to that consideration in terms of state interest here, contrast to violence, the property damage, the bombings, the threats and other disorder, traditionally subject to state prohibition with entirely peaceful concerted activity of the workers in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.911" offset="2122957">Consider the obvious differences between the sit-down strikes of years passed and even the more recent issues as to state jurisdiction to enforce trespass laws respecting private property in labor dispute situations with the entirely authorized and orderly conduct of the workers at K&amp;T’s plants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.607" offset="2205713">They did not occupy the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.501" offset="2213340">The controversy here arose when the employer wanted them to stay longer than they chose to stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.174" offset="2244060">Third, compare the conduct in Briggs-Stratton; 26 unauthorized and unannounced mid-shift union meetings, so called, supporting unstated demands designed so that management could not predict their occurrence and plant production around them with the entirely predictable known measured and we might even say subordinate concerted activity in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.029" offset="2371434">K&amp;T’s workers arrived at work at the appointed time each day for four months, performed their work without interruption and with customary productivity for the basic work day and work week.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.901" offset="2434963">They left work at the end of the established work day and work week merely exercising collectively, their acknowledged right, acknowledged by the employer to reject scheduled overtime work.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.490" offset="2669334">The narrow theory so-called is to focus on the character of the conduct here, the character of the overtime, the nature of the worker’s response and say this is right at the heart of federal concern, the kind of activity for which there is no state interest in substituting state judgment or local judgment for what Congress has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.275" offset="2748433">In fact, what that comes down the same very closely is this is at the center of the federal concern because this is conduct that is actually protected from employer reprisal by Section 7 of Taft-Hartley.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.686" offset="2806111">No, I do not think Briggs-Stratton, I think Briggs-Stratton really stands today for a very, very narrow holding to the extent it leaves it all and that holding is that in conduct -- that the conduct of the Union of Briggs-Stratton was so crude so without redeeming interest that it could be assimilated to the character of violence in a labor dispute or physical takeover of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.956" offset="2911123">This Court said as much in the O’Brien case cited in the CIO brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.141" offset="2927842">It analogized what it had been saying and doing in Briggs-Stratton, with labor dispute violence, physical takeover, physical obstruction, the exercise of physical force in a sit-down strike situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.695" offset="2978101">To that extent, perhaps Briggs-Stratton lives, but not to any greater extent than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.352" offset="3000776">I do not think anybody can say that the activity in Briggs-Stratton was -- the sit-down strike is protected from employer reprisal.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.945" offset="3051140">Dissenters in Briggs-Stratton and of course that was a very early decision Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.687" offset="3070052">We are focusing in on Section 13 and Section 501 of Taft-Hartley as whether that kind or whether those statutes preempted state prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.386" offset="3116864">I think preemption analysis has moved a great deal further on since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.788" offset="3138493">I think I would have to concede for example that an employer self-help weapon, legal under Federal Statute such as a lockout for example is the very kind of concern at the heart of Federal Labor policy that a state may not directly prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.699" offset="3202127">I do not think the dissenters in Briggs-Stratton were focusing on that kind of an issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.603" offset="3237758">Back to the factual analysis here, management knew in advance in our guess, unlike Briggs-Stratton, precisely what to expect, when to you expect it and the demands that it furthered.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.820" offset="3302647">The company would have liked to have had the overtime as well just as the workers would have liked to have the wagers payable for it, but the parties were without a Collective Bargaining Agreement and an impasse and negotiations and economic pressures appropriate to resolve the stalemate.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.497" offset="3373282">In some, as this Court later indicated in O’Brien, the Michigan Strike Board case, Briggs-Stratton survives if at all only with respect to concerted activities that can be fairly assimilated to physical takeover of the plant at sit-down strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.074" offset="4363636">I do not think that that would be protected by Section 7 of the Act against employer discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.749" offset="4398327">But it does not necessarily follow from the fact that it is not protected by Section 7 against employer discharge that the state under our Labor Relation statute would be empowered to prohibit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.808" offset="4466558">I think that that was Insurance Agents because in that case, as the Court may recall these agents engaged in a series of partial strike which involved reporting late and leaving on their own time and the Court, although it was willing to accept the Board’s concession that that would not be protected by Section 7 in the sense that the employer could discharge them, nevertheless found that the Board could not without upsetting the balance of economic weaponry that Congress had left go farther and prohibit it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1149.388" offset="4700929">In Insurance Agent the question was whether or not the Board could find that that was a violation of the duty of the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.288" offset="4752442">However, in finding that the Board could not through 8 (b) (3) outlaw this conduct because of its own feeling that this was more effective than a strike and hurt an employer more than a strike would, the rationale of the Court’s holding is based upon a consideration of the economic weapons that were left in reserve at the bargaining table and the Court concluded that although Congress had regulated the use of economic weapons for particular objectives, its failure to specifically prohibit the use of this tactic indicated an intention to leave it to the parties as part of the economic weaponry that they have to back-up their bargaining demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.394" offset="5016906">So that although Insurance Agents rested on 8 (b) (3), the rationale, we submit of it goes beyond 8 (b) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.465" offset="5077197">Now, I would like to just back-up a moment and give a little of the historical background here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.768" offset="5118366">Briggs-Stratton was decided 27 years ago when the Doctrine of Preemption was in its infancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.941" offset="5155042">The Court undertook to decide for itself whether activity was protected by Section 7 or prohibited by Section 8 of the Federal Act and on finding that was neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.340" offset="5196733">It concluded that the intermittent work stop which is there were left the state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.168" offset="5224005">Now, what is wrong with this approach?</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.214" offset="5232155">As this Court has recognized over the years, is it that it required the courts and ultimately this Court to decide in each case for itself whether activity was prohibited or protected and this was a difficult task that Congress entrusted primarily to the Board to determine and for which the Court was not too well-equipped to handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.767" offset="5334346">Secondly, it overlooked the fact that Congress may have designedly left some activity unregulated to the free play of economic forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.252" offset="5376351">Now, Garmon which came 10 years later was an effort to deal with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.183" offset="5400070">It enunciated the test that whether an activity is arguably subject to Section 7 or Section 8 of the Act, the states as well as the Federal Courts are ousted of jurisdiction and since this approach was inconsistent with Briggs-Stratton, the Court dropped to footnote in which it indicated that the Briggs-Stratton test is no longer of general application.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.693" offset="5806118">That is a question that if it is to be reexamined, it should be in a case where it makes a difference as to whether or not a finding that the activity is not protected by Section 7 against employer discharge would leave it open to State regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.966" offset="5903189">Now, in the area that we have in this case where you have the use of a peaceful economic weapon as part of the arsenal of weapons that are used at the bargaining table, I submit that the reasons that I indicated earlier, Insurance Agents makes it plain that that is an area that Congress left to the free play of economic forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.916" offset="13707009">I will be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.091" offset="13715682">I would like to refer to the Court and this is in response to a question asked by Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.258" offset="13732400">The petitioner’s Appendix Page A-32, paragraph 12, we will find a finding by the Commission’s examiner affirmed by the Commission with respect to the non-required optional nature of the overtime.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerry M. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="3423.916" offset="13798960">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.778" offset="13810454">In answer to Justice Stewart’s question about focusing is our legislative focus on partial strike activity, the answer of course is first of all that Mr. Come gave you and secondly, I would point out that the broader test must be used with respect to the Morton analysis because where are you going to find the legislative focus in so many words and quite the same way you found on 8 (b) (4) Secondary Boycott Pressures with respect to employer weaponry, the lock out, the unilaterally change, the right to replace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.918" offset="13938976">Third, and this is my basic answer to Mr. Mallatt, the Insurance Agents rationale disposes of every argument Mr. Mallatt made here because they were made by the Counsel for the NLRB in support of its decision finding it to violate Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.031" offset="14023404">Every point he made was argued by the Board and Insurance Agents and rejected in an opinion by Justice Brennan by this Court for considerations that must oust state power as well as federal agency regulation of that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.930" offset="14087038">If I may 14 (b), Mr. Chief Justice permits the states to regulate union security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.213" offset="14112220">Section 10 (a), as this Court just got to recognizing in the Immigration Act case, presents a very comprehensive and preemptive legislative scheme under Taft-Hartley that the next Section14 (b) in Union Shop, a very, very limited exception in favor of state jurisdiction.</text>
