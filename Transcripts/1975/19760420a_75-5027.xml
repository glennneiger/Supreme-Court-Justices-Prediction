            <label>Mr. Bernard P. Becker</label>
            <text syncTime="44.101" offset="279744">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.279" offset="288416">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Minnesota Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.850" offset="306702">The Court sustained the lower court decision, imposing and granting of judgment for a tax on a mobile home owned by an Indian, which is placed on trust land.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.933" offset="359052">The case originated in 1972 in the County Court, District Court in the Northern part of the Leech Lake Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.865" offset="394787">When the County assessed certain taxes, which are referred to in state law as mobile home tax or personal property taxes on this mobile home owned by Mr. Bryan who is an enrolled member of the tribe, lives with his family in this house trailer at Sequoia Lake on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.636" offset="469811">He has an assignment of Tribal Trust land from the Tribe which he uses as his home plot upon which that trailer rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.114" offset="507741">It is hooked to water sewer and electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.393" offset="524877">The District Court held that Public Law 280, authorized Minnesota to place and impose a tax on this kind of property, a mobile home used by an Indian as his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.895" offset="594885">The Minnesota Supreme Court sustained that reading of the statute and concluded that the Congress changed the authority that had heretofore been denied to the states and allow the states to impose their tax laws, including a Tax Law, which permitted the Counties to collect the tax on this Indian’s mobile home.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.000" offset="715362">The statute involved here is commonly known as Public Law 280 and if the Court please, I would refer to it as Public Law 280 throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.156" offset="747963">It has become the jargon of the trade so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.914" offset="763009">The citations are in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.019" offset="771368">It was passed in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.015" offset="783385">Prior to that time and as confirmed by this Court as late as 1973, states, absence on express authorization from Congress, had no authority to impose their tax laws within the boundaries of an Indian reservation on an Indian member of the tribe, we are not discussing non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.695" offset="878052">In 1953, due, as the legislative history indicates to a large measure, a breakdown on some reservations of law and order and in effect to Tribal Court Justice System, the Congress passed Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.441" offset="961122">Public Law 280 provided that criminal offenses committed by or against Indians within the Indian country in certain specified states, along which was Minnesota, accepting the Red Lake reservation, would be prosecutable in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.945" offset="1035101">On the civil side, as long as courts of the states were effectuating some order, hopefully and justice on the criminal side the legislation included a provision for causes of action, involving Indians which had heretofore been outside of the boundaries of state court Jurisdiction to be subject to adjudication in the state trial courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.903" offset="1170937">The language of the statute, we think is of critical importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.877" offset="1190790">The language of statute, it is 28 U.S.C. 1360 is the codification of the statute, after the clause, indicating which states would mandatorily be subject to its term sets, “Following states shall have jurisdiction over civil causes of action between Indians or to which Indians are parties, which arise in the areas of Indian countries listed” and then the statute goes on, “And those civil laws of such state or territory that are of general applications to private persons or private property shall have the same force and effect within such Indian Country as they had elsewhere in the state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="314.229" offset="1360273">Now, that is the A-part of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.233" offset="1368214">C, we believe has to be read in conjunction with A.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.014" offset="1387336">We -- our position very quickly is, that this is a cause of action, this is a lawyer’s statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.700" offset="1410114">Nobody uses words causes of action in general forums because somebody is going to say laws or applicability, you are subject to that law and nobody says you shall have a cause of action and what it shall be.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.105" offset="1447731">It is just not the kind of language most people would use unless they happen to be trained in the law or mis-trained or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.718" offset="1482212">But the C-section, I think nails down that cause of action reading of Section A and that is the last line.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.437" offset="1525053">It reaffirms the idea that the Tribal Governments will continue to have authority to promulgate Ordinances and Regulations and Customs which will govern their members in their daily lives as Indians on the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.841" offset="1834656">It is a word that lawyers use for adjudging, you know, disputes between individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.500" offset="1853360">The argument that civil laws of general application here means all laws, irrespective, negates the whole idea of causes of civil -- of cause of action as being an adjudicatory --</text>

            <text syncTime="474.074" offset="1999646">But I think you misread -- this statute if you read it as a termination statute because that is the way that is comes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.458" offset="2029112">Civil cause of action is a peculiar word.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.141" offset="2039874">You are reading it Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think as termination acts have been read, that is all laws, civil and criminal shall be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.919" offset="2071012">Our reading of this is and we think consistent with the legislative history is that this statute talks about making a forum for adjudicating disputes between Indians and non-Indians available on the reservation where they had heretofore been unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.010" offset="2143319">Once that decision to afford a forum has been made, the problem arises what kind of law is applied in that forum?</text>

            <text syncTime="528.737" offset="2218238">We read subsection (b) very differently and I think that that is the mistake that the Minnesota Supreme Court has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.278" offset="2240390">The Minnesota Supreme Court argues A, it means everything goes and B says this does not go and we do not think that that is a proper reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.476" offset="2273200">B, in our view is there for one purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.098" offset="2283754">It is there in the criminal sections and the civil sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.105" offset="2295770">It is there for the purpose of assuring the Indians that there would be no change in the Federal Trust Relationship and the Federal Trust Responsibility and the fact that that trust property taxes are referred to is part of that attempt by Congress to assure the Indians that this would work no change --</text>

            <text syncTime="577.152" offset="2411963">Now, certainly a lawyer would read subsection (b) as carving out a portion of authority that is otherwise delegated, would he not?</text>

            <text syncTime="607.822" offset="2534634">I do not want be complicated about it, but in talking about trust property, you just give the broad exemption, which is what you are arguing for anyway?</text>

            <text syncTime="615.514" offset="2565354">Well, is that -- we argued that that is the proper reading of the statute, Your Honor, but I think that the words causes of action combined with civil laws of general applicability to indicate to us that it is an adjudicatory section, but at worst or at best if you will, it is an ambiguous statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.374" offset="2632854">Certainly, it is not easy to figure out exactly what it means and I think the legislative history nails down that taxes were not intended to be authorized by the A portion or any other part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.840" offset="2678725">The legislative history is clear that this is a law and order statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.093" offset="2691682">The legislative history is clear that those states that were possibly coming under the terms of the statute because it was going to be at that time in 1953, a consent feature, a number of them, Nevada for example, refused to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.723" offset="2742255">They refused to come in because they would not have been able to recoup what they felt was their cost through taxation and not just taxation on trust properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.535" offset="2781438">There is discussions in the legislative history about taxation on sales and where they take place on and off the reservation and discussion of income taxes and corporate taxes and other kinds of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.855" offset="2822712">And it is -- if anything is clear from the language in the legislative history on the discussions is that nobody conceives this statute as changing in one-eye order, the tax status of Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.628" offset="2873807">I might add that nobody was also sure what the tax status was of Indian Reservations until 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.921" offset="2895019">So in a sense, that is an additional nail to the idea that that Congress was not sitting there, trying to figure out which taxes are we going to authorize, which are we not going to authorize.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.551" offset="2941517">The legislative history read in total, seems to us to says we are not doing anything with regard to taxes on this and B is in there, we want to assure you that the trust relationship is not changing.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.710" offset="2990105">Remember, in a sense this statute was not imposed upon the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.922" offset="3007032">The Indians came looking for the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.807" offset="3018526">The Government indicates the Indians agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.304" offset="3028557">It was not a matter of the Government saying, we are going to terminate you.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.677" offset="3042036">We are going to impose these alien courts on you.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.353" offset="3056769">There was agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.795" offset="3062516">Those reservations that did not agree, that felt that they had adequate law and order situations, that felt they had an adequately sophisticated Tribal Government, the Red Lake Reservation, the Warm Spring Reservation in Ohio, the Menomonee Reservation in Wisconsin, they were exempted without any difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.954" offset="3123120">Nobody fought about it, nobody argued about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.339" offset="3132629">It is not a matter of them arguing, well, we want to be outside of the scope of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.073" offset="3155616">I think it is relatively clear from the legislative history that taxes were not to be included.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.241" offset="4380237">I think that it is clear from the history and knowing that that question is unclear and it was only partially settled in 1973 that there was no discussion one way or another about taxes and taxes as a concept as an idea were accepted from this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.607" offset="4445752">The statute basically has nothing to do with taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.447" offset="4457141">The B proviso, which appears both on the criminal side and on the civil side seems to us is the kind of a provision that was put in there to assuage as we indicated the Indian fears that there was any change in the trust relationship and secondly, that there would be no reason to put that in on a criminal side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.888" offset="4534882">Why would you put a statute that says, exactly as it does on the civil side, no taxes on trust property, no alienation of land when we are talking about offense, criminal offense jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.291" offset="4576469">For the most part, that would not arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.705" offset="4586082">The authority to the tax if it came would not come from the authority over the criminal section, it would become because of all civil laws being applicable and somebody fails to pay and the failure to pay maybe a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.899" offset="4626937">But the authority would come from the civil side and yet that appears throughout the statute, which indicates to me, it was, I do not want to call it a Congressional, whatever, but a provision that appears in other places as well to make it clear to the Indians that they are not changing their status vis-a-vis the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.462" offset="4697154">Now, the way that State Courts have read that is B in fact, turns out to be the Section by which you find the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.565" offset="4725576">Suppose Congress had not put B in there, they had said we do not have to worry about assuaging any of the fears, there is nothing to have to fear, alright, and they took B out and they did not put it in, all you have is the A section, it would be awful tough to read that as conveying taxing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.715" offset="4782209">The only way the State Courts read it is by coming back in through B and saying well, then why did they put B in if A did not convey General Taxing Authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1206.089" offset="4927659">By putting in B, and in our view of the Congress put in B there as a help, as a method of persuading or assuring the Indians that they would not be changed in their status vis-a-vis the Federal, but that their trust relationship, the historic Federal trust responsibility would not be altered at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.604" offset="5009683">All that was happening is they were now getting a forum for adjudication of criminal matters and civil matters, which is what they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.549" offset="5037478">Now, to come in and to say Congress by putting in B and telling them now that we are going to not change anything, has in fact slipped one by the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.873" offset="5074781">They slipped it by because by putting in B, you read that as mini A, conveys general taxing authority to the extent that B does not exempt it and I think that is an awful burden to put on the Congress in terms of its general methodology of supposedly dealing with Indians with some degree of good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.595" offset="5149700">I think the only way to read that A, B the way the state and the lower court does is in fact, it was either inadvertent which I doubt or was slipped by the Tribes and I do not think that is true at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.258" offset="5196302">The Tribes agreed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1327.215" offset="5412178">This case deals with taxes and taxes have always been treated as a special case under Federal laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.431" offset="5585004">This is the first case on 280 directly to reach this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.609" offset="5597752">There is only two other cases on 280, you know, both of them deal with this issue one way or the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.237" offset="6736273">Yes, Your Honor, I would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.867" offset="6750797">The respondents’ position is based on four considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.584" offset="6765634">One is the statute itself, the second is the legislative history, third, is the judicial decisions and the fourth is the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.056" offset="6807535">With respect to the statute itself, the Minnesota Supreme Court and our position is that the statute grants the authority to the states to have the civil laws, that are general application apply in Indian territory, except that any real or personal property that is held in trust by the United States or subject to restriction against alienation imposed by United States shall not be subject to taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.609" offset="6945775">We are not talking about the accepted property in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.178" offset="6956015">We are talking about personal property which is not held in trust and which is not subject to restriction against alienation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.076" offset="6983600">I would like to come back, but perhaps this is a good time to deal with the question of whether or not it is personal property or real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.483" offset="7017246">If this mobile home were real property, it would be exempt from taxation under the provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.505" offset="7057370">This case was tried from the beginning on the assumption that we were talking about here is a tax on personal property, it has not been contended in the District Court nor in the Minnesota Supreme Court or until now that this mobile home for the purpose of this litigation constitutes real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.550" offset="7145559">But as I say if this Court were to assume that this issue were open in the case which I do not believe it is, and were to assume that this mobile home is real property and not personal property, the statute exempts that property from taxation, there is no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.901" offset="7222882">Anyway, that is our reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.940" offset="7235107">Secondly, as far as the Congressional history, the legislative history, we have examined that very carefully and it is not helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.203" offset="7280142">There is nothing that we were able to find in the Congressional hearings where this question of the taxation, whether the states were being granted authority to subject the Indians to these taxes was definitively discussed by anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.847" offset="7354748">So I am afraid that we cannot have any, there is no help, of course, in the legislative history of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.863" offset="7382751">As far as the judicial decisions are concerned we have four, the Minnesota District Court, the Minnesota Supreme Court, the Federal District Court in Nebraska in the Peter’s case which was affirmed by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.525" offset="7445445">We have only these four judicial decisions that each hold that Public Law 280 does grant to the states the authority and jurisdiction to tax the Indians, except for the accepted property which I have mentioned.</text>
