            <label>Mr. Jack D. Walker</label>
            <text syncTime="47.060" offset="291571">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.769" offset="302438">This case arises out of the application of procedural Due Process to a decision of an elected local School Board, to terminate and replace teachers who are striking unlawfully at the time of and after their discharge and replacement, and who in addition were given the opportunity to apply for reemployment, but did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.727" offset="398255">A divided Wisconsin Supreme Court, prior to this Court’s decision in Withrow versus Larkin, held that whenever a School Board has had prior involvement or stated in other way, whenever a School Board has an interest which is adverse to an employee interest, a Court or other agency not responsible for school district policy, must determine not only whether the School Board’s discharge decision was substantially lawful and not arbitrary, but also whether another course of action would have been more reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.374" offset="528867">In this case, the School Board under Wisconsin law have the exclusive duty to bargain with the labor union which represented its teaching employees, and in addition had the exclusive duty under State law to employ and dismiss teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.765" offset="582366">The Wisconsin Court found these functions constitutionally incompatible.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.575" offset="601592">Facts are that in March of 1974, the School Board and the union were bargaining the for renewal of their collective bargaining agreement. On March 18, the teachers went on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.717" offset="646209">At that time they were then teaching under one-year individual contracts of employment, pursuant to Wisconsin law.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.074" offset="675676">The strike closed the public school.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.248" offset="692289">During the strike, the District sent each teacher two letters inviting them to return to work and in the second warning that the School Board would not condone the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.368" offset="736802">A few teachers offered to return to work in response to the first letter, but none offered to return in response to the second letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.643" offset="765955">When there was no response to the second invitation to return, the School Board decided to consider whether to terminate and replace the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.826" offset="802631">Pursuant to the apparent requirements of Board of Regents versus Roth, the teachers were given notice and an opportunity to be heard respecting the action under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.077" offset="859682">At the hearing, which was scheduled pursuant to those notices before the School Board, the teachers appeared as a group represented by a counsel and took the position that they would not speak individually and would not answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.260" offset="912345">Counsel on their behalf took the following positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.422" offset="924988">First that the School Board could infer they were in fact on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.734" offset="942229">Second, that because the School Board was involved in the bargaining over which they were striking, the School Board could not act in the matter and could not infer that the strike was a breach of contract or unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.734" offset="990294">And third, counsel for the teachers asserted that the School Board had in the past not bargained in good faith as required by Wisconsin law.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.754" offset="1026343">The counsel for the School Board reminded counsel for the teachers at that point that the correct forum under Wisconsin law for any allegation of an employer-prohibited practice was the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission and informed counsel for the teachers that in his view, whether or not the School Board was alleged to have refused to bargain, was immaterial to the question of a strike, because under Wisconsin law there is no concept of a prohibited practice or justified strike and because in any event jurisdiction of those matters lay with the WERC.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.041" offset="1159463">The WERC is an Agency similar to the National Labor Relations Board, which may decide and may annul any discharge which it’s found -- it finds to have been based in whole or in any part in an anti-union motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.426" offset="1217037">The counsel for the teachers in effect agreed that any remedy of an alleged prohibited practice would not terminate the strike, and that the teachers would return to work when a contract acceptable to them had been agreed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.312" offset="1272626">He did this by stating that it would do him no good to go before the WERC with an allegation of a prohibited practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.354" offset="1304704">The teachers have in fact never filed any prohibited practice complaint against the School Board over any aspects of these matters, or never filed any such complaint at all, ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.206" offset="1356113">Positions which were not taken by the teachers at the hearing were -- there was no attempt to prove or proof that there was any personal bias toward any individual teacher by any member of the School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.555" offset="1401566">Their position was an institutional incompatibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.311" offset="1416613">Second, there was no offer to return to work made by the teachers at that hearing or any indication of an offer other than that in effect, the strike would continue until agreement satisfactory to teachers was reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.219" offset="1468231">After the hearings, the School Board met and voted to terminate and replace the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.660" offset="1489965">As a part of the same decisions, the School Board determined to invite each teacher to apply for reemployment, and each notice, a written notice of termination to each teacher in fact did contain what the Wisconsin Court described as a notice of a right to apply for reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.185" offset="1556107">Only one teacher did so apply and he was returned to his former position.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.454" offset="1581184">On April 8, 1974, the schools reopened with contractive replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.422" offset="1605008">This action was begun alleging a denial of Due Process and in connection with beginning the action, the teachers asked a Wisconsin Circuit Court to enjoin the School Board from hiring permanent replacements, but did not in connection with that motion make an offer to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.555" offset="1677524">After an evidentiary hearing, the Wisconsin Court denied the injunction against hiring replacements, and he noted in his opinion doing so that the teachers were still on strike and consequently depriving themselves of employment on April 11, 1974, some nine days after the terminations and four days after the school opened with contracted replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.721" offset="1770206">With respect to the underlying complaint, the School Board moved for summary judgment and in connection of that motion each party had the opportunity to and did make a record to show facts, which they thought were material and in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.692" offset="1830079">The significance here is that the teachers again made no claim of or facts to show any personal bias on the part of any member of the School Board toward any individual teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.349" offset="1872711">Again, the focus was an institutional incompatibility, and again, with respect to this motion in June of 1974, the teachers made no effort to claim that there had been any offer to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.200" offset="1928090">The later point is significant because in briefs before this Court, respondent’s now claim that they could prove that there was an offer made in April of ’74, however, the incident referred to was not an unconditional offer and was conditional and was in fact made on April 25, some eighteen days after the School Board had contracted and begun operating with contracted replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.644" offset="2021922">The Circuit Court granted the Board’s motion for summary judgment in the teachers' appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.659" offset="2041984">The Wisconsin Supreme Court held that under state law, a School Board could discharge these teachers who engaged in the prohibited strike, and the Court rejected the claim that prohibiting this strike was a denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.801" offset="2102588">However, the Wisconsin Court held that the teachers have been denied procedural Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.090" offset="2123695">In Wisconsin Court’s view, under Morrissey versus Brewer, even in a case of a stipulated or undisputed facts, an involved decision maker had to decide what to do on the basis of those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.150" offset="2175940">The Wisconsin Court also did not make any finding of a personal bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.183" offset="2192032">Rather it said that it was not suggesting that School Board members were anything other than dedicated public servants striving to preside -- provide their district with quality education within their limited budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.415" offset="2245008">The Wisconsin Court made it clear that that defect it saw was an institutional perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.974" offset="2267264">It did so by analyzing the methods of review available to the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.712" offset="2286177">It noted that under common law certiorari or by complaint to the Employment Relations Commission, any substantive violation of law was curable, and review it to determine whether or not the decision was arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.211" offset="2340198">But the Court said neither of these methods could replace an impartial decision maker in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.821" offset="2362663">When you say neither of these methods, Mr. Walker, you mentioned the common law of writ of certiorari, then what was the other method?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack D. Walker</label>
            <text syncTime="572.698" offset="2394115">The other method, Justice Rehnquist, described by the Wisconsin Supreme Court is by complaint to the Employment Relations Commission, and in its discussion of that relief the Court noted specifically that the Employment Relations Commission would overturn any discharge which was based on an anti-union motive, even if there was also a good reason for discharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.627" offset="2469870">But the teachers have gone directly onto Court where they sued for breach of contract?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack D. Walker</label>
            <text syncTime="595.983" offset="2487215">They could have done so and the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not directly allude to that, although we had mentioned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.603" offset="2513756">They would have had two methods of suing for breach of contract, at least two. One under Wisconsin law, the Employment Relations Commission cannot only hear normal prohibited practices, but may also entertain suits for breach of collective bargaining agreements and the teachers could probably could have sued in Court on that or in Court on the individual contracts, and did not do any of those things.</text>

            <text syncTime="997.620" offset="4093850">Actually, it is institutional and it is not teacher versus School Board, it is representative of teacher versus school district as an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.087" offset="4131676">There is further insulation that is not even present in the intoxication case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.154" offset="4159992">The interests of employers and employees as has been noted are often adverse and as quote with the Wisconsin decision can extend beyond strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.688" offset="4202102">Employers frequently must make discharge decisions, and they are willing to do so when their decisions are subject to review and the standards of review are known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.971" offset="4239196">But in this case where the matter to be reviewed is not whether the discharge was substantively lawful and not arbitrary, but whether the employer’s policy should be reexamined or its prior involvement was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.785" offset="4290500">Employers will be made timid if not all together none-functioning and unwilling to make the sorts of policy decisions and implementations which they were elected to make.</text>

            <text syncTime="1064.634" offset="4361867">The fact of striking has been admitted and it is admitted and settled, with striking is a cause for discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.933" offset="4387049">At the time of the discharge, these teachers were in fact not in possession of the property they now claim because they were on strike and did not have income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.540" offset="4421530">In addition, each of the teachers was invited to return to work not only before, but also after his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.405" offset="4448907">The employees could have retained their property they now claim by the unilateral act of returning to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1095.235" offset="4484224">The respondents appear to acknowledge in their briefs before this Court that the mere location of bargaining and discharge functions is not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.246" offset="4516303">Instead, the respondents now seek to recast the opinion of the Wisconsin’s Supreme Court to create the illusion that a personal bias was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.338" offset="4552665">They assert that merely by accusing the School Board of bargaining in bad faith, they have shown that each member of the School Board was personally biased against each individual teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.915" offset="4591013">This claim should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.352" offset="4596760">First, because there is no concept of a justified or prohibited practice strike under Wisconsin law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.863" offset="4626748">Second, because in any event the state has allocated the function of determining prohibited practices both hearing and remedying them to an Employment Relations Commission and the teachers consistently and beginning at the hearing before the School Board, renounced their right to pursue that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.113" offset="4695816">The Sixth Circuit in the Lake Michigan College case, has concluded that in this circumstances that this allocation of functions by state governments is constitutional and that there is no disqualification of a School Board for making these sorts of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.832" offset="4758614">The Wisconsin law contemplates just what the Federal Labor law contemplates in private employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.342" offset="4784737">The jurisdiction over not only what is an unfair labor practice, but what effect does an unfair labor practice have on a strike as with a specialized agency, and it is not up to the determination merely by allegation of the striking employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.668" offset="4854014">Any claim of sex discrimination or any claim that the discharge has been based on an anti-union motivation would disqualify an employer if the respondents' claim in this case is acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.861" offset="4926738">Recently, Wisconsin Circuit Court in fact has applied the Hortonville decision, in a matter which is unfortunately not reported anywhere, to a sex discrimination case, holding that merely because a female employee has filed a sex discrimination charge with a state agency, that the University of Wisconsin Board of Regions was thereafter disqualified from considering her termination of employment and instead a Wisconsin Circuit Court would have to consider her termination of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.906" offset="5050977">We think in effect that since the teachers here have ignored both their opportunities to return to work before and after their discharge and replacement, and have ignored their substantive right to pursue claims of wrongdoing before State Agency having jurisdiction to remedy them and have instead pursued only their view of a policy neutral or policy neuter, decision maker as an end in itself and not as a means against the protection of an arbitrary taking of property or substance of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.148" offset="5167901">We believe that they have done this in order to obtain not merely the substantive right to strike, but the substantive right to strike without being replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.541" offset="5205517">We believe that procedural Due Process does not contemplate the change in substantives rights of this magnitude.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.916" offset="6174974">The Wisconsin Supreme Court said none of these remedies are exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.077" offset="6191692">The Statutes says that, 111.07 says that going to WERC is not an exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.238" offset="6220322">There are no exclusive remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.289" offset="6256476">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.270" offset="6260446">They are not adequate, and that is the point that I think is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.109" offset="6279777">We do have de novo review all over the place on various aspects, but not the kind of de novo review that we seek in this case and the reason is that the issue is not merely whether a strike has been committed by the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.281" offset="6352502">Under Wisconsin law, unlike the Federal law, where Congress said the penalty for striking is discharge, the legislature of Wisconsin gave no penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.064" offset="6403597">They just said striking is prohibited, a word taken out of the labor context as a prohibited practice like any other prohibited practice --</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.608" offset="6573811">In taking into account, the determination of reasonable penalty is not as counsel has stated, that a Court is going to decide an order of School Board to engage in arbitration or engage in mediation or to go into further bargaining, that is not the point.</text>
