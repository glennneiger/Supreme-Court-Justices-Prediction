            <text syncTime="35.050" offset="245718">There has been traditional that the practice of professions are to be above the morals of the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.272" offset="274661">This case presents the question whether the practice of pharmacy in the dispensing of drugs should be subject to the morals of the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.526" offset="311651">Should prescription drugs be advertised?</text>
            <text syncTime="55.254" offset="326593">The concerns of this case, however, are not only in the profession of pharmacy or rather in each and every profession, law, medicine, optometry, dentistry and any other profession controlled by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.221" offset="386466">The true question then is the ability of a legislature to regulate these professions within the economic and social policies deemed provident.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.740" offset="428470">In Virginia, the practice of pharmacy is a profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.086" offset="445920">It has been deemed a profession by the general assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.225" offset="458459">It has been found a profession by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.506" offset="471520">It is a profession from the time that the pharmacist procures the drug, through the time that he prepares it, compounds it, dispenses it, and delivers it to the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.240" offset="518541">Our brief in footnote 3, pages six and seven, sets forth some of the statutes which comprise the scheme by which the profession of pharmacy is regulated in the Commonwealth.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="116.955" offset="573398">How do you define a profession?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_f_troy" startTime="120.656" stopTime="280.096">
            <label>Mr. Anthony F. Troy</label>
            <text syncTime="120.656" offset="588131">Your Honor, the general assembly has defined this profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.531" offset="611641">It has defined it within the scheme work of what is traditionally been defined as this profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.781" offset="628673">A learned profession requirement of a degree or requirement of some protection to the health, safety and welfare of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.296" offset="662737">And in this case, it has been shown and not only by statute but in the record itself that the pharmacist is the last professional who interposes himself between a patient and a drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.991" offset="721460">He has a vital role in the medical health team.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.221" offset="738387">In 1968, the Virginia general assembly enacted a measure prohibiting the advertisement of the price of prescription drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.297" offset="778720">The history of that statute is set forth in the appendix at page 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.830" offset="796901">And I would point out here in response to the appellee’s statement that the legislature enacted this without any basis whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.871" offset="828980">The short answer is that since that 1968 enactment, the statute has been enacted or amended twice with full knowledge of the 1969 federal court decision sustaining the validity of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.475" offset="891465">And the legislature declared by this statute than any pharmacist who advertised, would be guilty of unprofessional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.833" offset="924901">The statute regulates only the conduct of the pharmacist.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.273" offset="950606">As the appendix demonstrates and as Judge Butzner of the Fourth Circuit found speaking for the three-judge court in Patterson Drug Company v. Kingery, a pharmacist “must have an extensive knowledge of a wide range of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.357" offset="1011001">Accuracy is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.568" offset="1019778">Mistakes can be serious”.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.115" offset="1030018">Just four pages of the appendix, pages 44 through 47 demonstrate by the testimony of Mr. Carl M. Zwiller, a pharmacist in nearby Loudoun County that a pharmacist plays a vital role in the health field and the dispensing of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.733" offset="1100444">A pharmacist in dispensing drugs is doing more and what I as layman would comprehend that is taking bottle -- pills from a big bottle counting to 25 to 30 and pouring pills into small bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.975" offset="1161466">The entire educational training of a pharmacist is geared to impart to him a knowledge greater than a physician as relates to drugs, their chemical composition and the reactions, contraindications or synergistic effects of such chemical elements.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.521" offset="1427602">For example, Mr. M Zwiller detailed again on the appendix pages 44 through 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.793" offset="1452679">Two instances of the utilization in value of the medical profile cards among typical examples, he detailed two instances where medical profile record assist in the dispensing of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.508" offset="1503566">One, an example of a patient taking a blood pressure tablet which would have due to a chemical element in such table, potentially aid an anesthesia that was about to be administered prepared toward the surgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.002" offset="1557587">Another specific example was a patient taking a tranquilizer.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.628" offset="1580053">He was then prescribed the different type of tranquilizer.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.159" offset="1594159">The second one had what was known as an MAO inhibitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.753" offset="1608578">In short a drug which would interfere and the matter in which the body was utilizing to form a drug.</text>

            <text syncTime="1155.467" offset="4727390">Because the Bigelow is simply not applicable for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.378" offset="4751109">In this case, what is advertised, is commercial advertising in is pure sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.877" offset="4777022">Phrases such as compare, safe, pay less or dial a discount do not as found in Bigelow convey information of interest regarding reform, the subject matter of the law in another state or advertise activity which pertains to a constitutional interest, abortion in Bigelow. Such phrases do no more and simply propose a commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.213" offset="4890394">They are entitled to little, if any constitutional weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.757" offset="4908575">However, as I’ve said those phrases would create perhaps a retail incentive for price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.237" offset="4938459">But again where is the constitutional right to the lowest price possible?</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.466" offset="4959461">Trying to ensure the lowest price is in the context in itself a wise economic policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.014" offset="4989555">It's not however I suggest a constitutional pre-requisite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.630" offset="5008049">For example, does every victim of an anti trust price fixing conspiracy have a cause of action, for violation of First Amendment rights not withstanding the Parker Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.275" offset="5062697">If a balancing or whatever First Amendment interests are involved must be made and as I have stated, it should be done in light of this Court's recognition for over 40 years for the inherent interest of the state through it's police power to regulate the various professions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.328" offset="5130825">Since, in this case it is the manner by which price information is disseminated and not the actual dissemination of price information itself that is regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.631" offset="5176069">Then the balancing, if any must be done as it was in McDonald, not under a compelling interest doctrine but under the rational relationship test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.193" offset="5218283">In the Instant case, that test has been applied and the statute has been found not wanting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.003" offset="5245555">It has been found by a District Court whose decision was declared to have no infirmity by the lower court, to have a statute before it which has a rationale and reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.935" offset="5297277">The Virginia statute, wise or foolish, economically sound or improvident should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.355" offset="5330923">By doing so, this Court will be sustaining the constitutional framework, the legislative bodies, not courts must decide the wisdom of economic and social policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.179" offset="5382227">We cannot and should not turn back the clock for 40 years under the guise of an independent right to know which would begin anew the scrutiny of wisdom of legislative choices in the health, regulatory and other professional fields.</text>

            <text syncTime="1346.927" offset="5493300">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.653" offset="5504167">This is a First Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.125" offset="5518064">There is only one question and that’s the constitutionality of the Virginia statute which prohibits the advertising of the price of prescription drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.424" offset="5555262">The pharmacy board below on its brief in this Court, relied on Valentine against Christianson for the proposition that commercial advertising is entitled to no protection under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.731" offset="5608448">Now whatever the merits of that position may have been before June 16 of last year when this Court decided Bigelow that position simply has no merit today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.207" offset="5650348">Bigelow clearly and unmistakably forecloses any broad argument based on Valentine that all commercial advertising is outside the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.765" offset="5696637">Bigelow says you’ve got to look at the information being conveyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.354" offset="5714923">You’ve got to balance the interest in having that information conveyed against the interest of the state in prohibiting the dissemination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.046" offset="5745747">The traditional kind of First Amendment balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.200" offset="5758390">Bigelow said you have to find a clear relationship between the prohibitions and the goals of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.465" offset="5787439">Now Bigelow did not specifically decide whether under the line of cases, it did rely upon the cases such as the New York Times, against Sullivan and Pittsburg press which were precursors and we say whatever Valentine once stood for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.905" offset="5861208">It now only relates in the manner in which the distribution maybe controlled by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.309" offset="5886808">Counsel for the pharmacy board today said “well Bigelow is not a commercial advertising case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.339" offset="5910946">Let me read you from the brief from the state of Virginia put in the Bigelow case last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.505" offset="5939576">Counsel for the state of Virginia was the same counsel exactly as on the brief today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.049" offset="5961728">And let me read you from page seven referring to the advertisement in Bigelow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.924" offset="5981267">Appellant's conduct is clearly within the hardcore of commercial activity unprotected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.216" offset="6010420">Page nine, the advertisement therefore can only be viewed as a proposal for the sale of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.067" offset="6037796">Page 11, quite simply, if the advertisement does no more than propose a commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.574" offset="6067889">That’s exactly what they contended here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.079" offset="6081891">That’s what they contended last year and that’s what we suggest today as what went on Bigelow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.095" offset="6101953">There was essentially a commercial transaction, true it was for the sale of services for abortions as opposed to the sale of pills but essentially in terms of the First Amendment kind of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.255" offset="6146570">That is the First Amendment has no applicability to commercial transaction, the proposition is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.310" offset="6170812">Now, as the Court is aware, the traditional First Amendment analysis requires that the state is unable to prevail unless it can show both a compelling state interest and that it has accomplished that interest by the least restrictive alternative possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.397" offset="6235177">That particular mode of analysis was not specifically adopted in Bigelow nor was it rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.658" offset="6260150">The court simply said, a clear relationship has to be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.191" offset="6274361">Now, we believe that as in Bigelow, it wasn't necessary to decide whether all First Amendment analysis carry forth with those compelling state interest and the least restrictive alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.767" offset="6320650">You don’t have to decide that question here today because whichever way, you strike the balance, the scale tips so heavily in favor of public disclosure of this information under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.280" offset="6370701">That under even the most relaxed rationale relationship test, the plaintiffs will prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.423" offset="7027210">I don’t think North Dakota Pharmacy can be read so broadly as to prohibit any substantive due process challenge but we didn’t consider that it was appropriate for us to go under here when we made that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.420" offset="7107249">First that those cases analyzed the question only from the Fourteenth Amendment points of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.014" offset="7137551">Footnote ten on the Bigelow case last year page 15 of the slip opinion specifically notes the fact that Head in particular did not consider the First Amendment challenge because it had not been properly been brought before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.644" offset="7192095">Second, the same thing is true when it was emphasized in the Pittsburg press case, again footnote ten at page 387 of 413 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.381" offset="7227099">So this Court has recognized on two separate occasions that those cases do not involve First Amendment but aside from the fact that they don’t involve the First Amendment, I think the most important thing to note about reading those cases is that there's not one word of mention any place in there, about the interest that the consumers have in finding out this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.131" offset="7322080">Now I’ll talk about that interest in a minute but regardless of whatever the extent of the interest is, the fact that consumers have the interest in finding out how much they are going to have to pay for drugs that may save their lives in this case, is a kind of question that was never even considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.203" offset="7842335">We cannot predict the outcome of that case now because we don’t know first, what kind of information we are talking about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.526" offset="9479690">So we are not dealing with something that’s optional even, we are dealing with prescription drugs and the doctor has a professional obligation to be sure that antagonistic drugs aren’t taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="2405.055" offset="9725764">The second reason is that the monitoring -- that the statute is vastly ineffective for achieving even the limited ends that it’s supposed to achieve.</text>

            <text syncTime="2427.745" offset="9816565">One maybe closer to one doctor, maybe closer to their home, their office, there maybe non prescription drug sales at one place and they decided, well, as long as I’m in here I might as well fill my prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.564" offset="9863795">Indeed the way the advertising rules work, the pharmacist can advertise non-prescription drugs, non-drug items, they can even advertise that they’ll give you free cup of coffee while you wait and they can advertise free delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.150" offset="9922100">But the one thing that the consumer really wants to know is what's it going to cost, where in this range of 100% to 600% variation, are you Mr. Pharmacist going to fall?</text>
