            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73795">The judgment and opinion in 74-1055, Stone against Powell and 74-1222 Wolff against Rice, two companion cases and 74-1560, United States against Martinez-Fuerte and 75-5387, Martinez-Fuerte against the United States will each be announced by Mr. Justice Powell.</text>

            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="27.945" offset="185495">As these two cases present the same issue, we deal with them in a single opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.750" offset="208691">Both come from the United States Court's of Appeals, one from the Sixth and the other from the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.698" offset="236486">Each of the respondents was convicted of murder in trials in California and Nebraska state courts and their convictions were affirmed on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.854" offset="317152">Thereafter each sought Federal Habeas Corpus relief under 28 U.S.C.A., Section 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.014" offset="353828">They contended that evidence seized during allegedly illegal searches and seizures, the murder weapon in one case and dynamite particles in the defendant's pocket in the other should have been excluded from the evidence under the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.661" offset="416417">The Federal Courts of Appeals agreed and granted writs of Habeas Corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.216" offset="438569">Petitioners are the wardens of the state prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.960" offset="453615">They content that the exclusionary rule in Fourth Amendment cases should not be applied in Federal Habeas Corpus proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.955" offset="485589">Although this Court in several prior cases has assumed the application of the Rule, we have never heretofore specifically addressed this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.139" offset="530311">The primary justification for the exclusionary rule is the deterrence of unlawful police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.518" offset="563852">The Rule was created by this Court as a means of effectuating the important rights, guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.013" offset="601782">For many years the Rule was not deemed applicable to state courts, but 15 years ago, in Mapp against Ohio, the Court extended the Rule to trials and appeals in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.167" offset="658415">Decisions subsequent to Mapp have established that the Rule is not a personal constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.504" offset="687777">Even a trial, and on direct review the cost of applying the exclusionary Rule is not insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.810" offset="721005">The focus of a trial is diverted from the ultimate question of guilt or innocence that should be the central consent of a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.748" offset="760711">Moreover the physical evidence sought to be excluded under the Rule often is the most probative information bearing on guilt or innocence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.793" offset="808881">Application of the Rule thus deflects, the truth finding process and often frees the guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.455" offset="839601">These cost of the exclusionary Rule apply with special force when following conviction and appeal in a state court, the issue again is presented on habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.022" offset="893831">We conclude, therefore, that the contribution of the Rule toward restraining police misconduct is minimal when applied on collateral attack often long after trial and appeal, but we make clear the limited scope of our decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.516" offset="963839">This case does not deal with a habeas corpus statute as a means for re-litigating constitutional claims generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.749" offset="996753">We hold only that a Federal court need not apply the exclusionary rule on Fourth Amendment claims, unless there was a showing that the state prisoner was denied a full and fair hearing on that claim at trial and on direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.947" offset="1069583">In short, the application of the Rule on habeas is limited to cases in which there has been both such a showing and a Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.233" offset="1114722">The Chief Justice has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.374" offset="1127261">Mr, Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.453" offset="1151607">Mr. Justice White also has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
