            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.994" offset="109616">The United States Air Force Academy has an Honor Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.499" offset="127589">Under that code, cadets pledge that they will not lie, steal, or cheat, or tolerate among their numbers anyone who does.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.724" offset="168549">Now that code is administered by an Honor Committee composed of Academy cadets.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.727" offset="196552">Alleged violations of the Code are adjudicated by that committee and the consequences for a cadet found guilty of the violation can be very serious indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.532" offset="243781">There is also an Ethics Code, violations of which are breaches of conduct, less serious than Honor Code violations and that code too is cadet administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.960" offset="293414">Records are prepared and retained by both the Honor Code and Ethics Code committees, respecting the adjudication of violations they hear, in Honor Code violations, for example, the case summaries, usually only a page are prepared and posted on 40 squadron bulleting boards throughout the academy, but with except in cases of guilt findings of serious offenses with the names of the cadets involved deleted and alike distribution is made of Ethics Code summaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.159" offset="446283">Confidentiality of these summaries was maintained by Academy custom and practice in the sense that cadets generally are instructed not to read them, except when they seek guidance as to the conduct that falls within or without the codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.629" offset="516186">Now this case arose when the respondents who are students or were, when the case was brought, students at New York University Law School and editors of its law review, sought access to both Honor and Ethics Code summaries for personal references or other identifying information deleted however.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.710" offset="600510">In connection with their law review article on the subject of disciplinary procedures and systems at the military service academies generally, because I gather both the Naval Academy at Annapolis and the Military Academy at West Point also function under Honor Codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.391" offset="679190">But when the academy, the Air Force Academy that is, and the Department of the Air Force denied access, the respondents brought this action under the Freedom of Information Act, and the Air Force defended the action on the ground that the exemption or rather that the summaries were exempt from disclosure, are specific exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act itself, namely Exemption 2 that exempts matters related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency or under Exemption 6 that exempts personal and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.025" offset="877721">And the District Court for the Southern District New York dismissed the suit, holding that indeed Exemption 2 did exempt the summaries from disclosure and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.392" offset="931220">The Court of Appeals held that Exemption 2 did not exempt the summaries from disclosure and then turned to Exemption 6, and held that Exemption 6, at least in respect of the determination required by that exemption, namely whether a disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of the cadets or the subjects of the summaries, required that the summaries be turned over to the District Court for in camera inspection, and that the Air force cooperate with the judge in redacting the summaries so as to delete personal references and all other identifying information and we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.279" offset="1126720">We hold that the in camera procedure, ordered by the Court of Appeals, will further the statutory goal of Exemption 6, which enacts a workable compromise between individual rights and preservation of public rights to government information.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.329" offset="1194952">These limited statutory exemptions can’t obscure the basic policy that disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Freedom of Information Act and the public does have a substantial concern with the Air Force Academy’s administration of disciplinary procedures that affect the training of Air Force officers and their military careers.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.644" offset="1288157">The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Rehnquist dissent and each has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.687" offset="1316369">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
