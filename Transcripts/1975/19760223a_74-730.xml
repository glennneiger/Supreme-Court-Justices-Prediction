            <text syncTime="33.734" offset="238269">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.310" offset="252584">This is an appeal from the United States District Court of Three Judges for the District of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.324" offset="276617">At issue is the constitutionality of a Maryland law which authorizes the direct payment of public aid to church-related and other private colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.173" offset="335967">The appellants are four Maryland citizens and taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.913" offset="354984">They contend that this Maryland law violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.782" offset="390406">The appellees are four church-related colleges of Maryland as well as the members of the Board of Public Works of Maryland which is charged with administering the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.300" offset="440562">A Three-Judge panel which had been convened upheld the constitutionality of this legislation by a 2-1 vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.615" offset="477760">At the outset, I would like to invite the Court’s attention to at least one major distinction between this legislation and other church state legislation previously considered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.352" offset="532722">This legislation provides for a general purpose grant to be paid directly to church-related colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.624" offset="569815">It is not limited, for example, to construction grants such as this Court upheld in 1971 in Tilton versus Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.124" offset="611820">The Act at issue would allow the payment of both capital and operating expenditures with state aid, and so the aid could be used for construction, maintenance, and repairs of buildings, teacher salaries, scholarships, and virtually any of the myriad of costs which are incurred by church-related colleges.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="149.734" stopTime="151.880">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="149.734" offset="702309">But there is some limitation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_s_greenwald" startTime="151.880" stopTime="442.699">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence S. Greenwald</label>
            <text syncTime="151.880" offset="710877">The only use restriction, Mr. Justice Brennan, is found in Section 68 (a) of the Act which states that no money shall be used for sectarian purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.221" offset="752255">That is the only use restriction which is in the Act or in the recently promulgated regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.062" offset="783602">In order for a college to be eligible for aid, it must meet a variety of secular requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.728" offset="814217">For example, it must be a non-profit educational institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.820" offset="830622">It must be private, accredited by the State Board of Education and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.060" offset="851520">The only eligibility requirement relating to religion is that the institution cannot be one awarding only seminarian or theological degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.144" offset="899899">And so, an institution such as Mt. St. Mary’s College, one of the appellees, which awards both seminarian degrees and liberal arts degrees may be eligible for aid under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.473" offset="961234">As I have indicated earlier, the Act is administered by the State Board of Public Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.353" offset="984744">The Board of Public Works is assisted by the Council for Higher Education which undertakes the buts and bolts stated in the administration of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.783" offset="1030406">The administration of the Act includes a three-stage process of enforcing the use for sectarian purposes restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.198" offset="1076069">The first stage is a pre-expenditure report which is filed annually by the school with the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.184" offset="1112013">This, according to the recently promulgated regulations, identifies the purposes for which the aid is intended to be used and includes an affidavit by the institution that the aid will not be used for sectarian purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.727" offset="1174184">The second stage, again, furnished on an annual basis, is a so-called Utilization of Funds Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.887" offset="1210860">This is a second report furnished by the institution to the state which describes how the aid in fact has been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.078" offset="1247641">The third stage of enforcement of use restriction involves necessary follow up by the state to ascertain that the aid was not used for religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.823" offset="1298632">This follow up may be in the form of inquiries by the state to the institution for more details as to how the aid was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.093" offset="1331651">It may also be in the form of audits to which these expenditures are subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.790" offset="1362475">As of the date of the judgment, there were 18 aid-recipients in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.988" offset="1387239">Four of these, four appellees, are admittedly church-related institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.854" offset="1414720">Now, the appellees, as I have said, are immediately church-related and the lower court expressly found that they were church-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.429" offset="1448993">The lower court also found that their predominant mission is the functioning as a secular educational institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.554" offset="1493505">The lower court also found that all of the schools have secondary objectives; the encouragement of spiritual development of the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.888" offset="1542824">This finding as to secondary objective is plainly supported by the record and by the school’s own perceptions of themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.736" offset="1582217">For example, Loyola College expressly identifies itself with the Catholic and Jesuit tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.065" offset="1607608">The other appellees have similar expressions of identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.893" offset="1630909">This Court’s decisions have furnished us with a three-fold framework of analysis in establishment clause questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.093" offset="1667690">In order for a statute to survive an establishment clause challenge, it must have a secular legislative purpose, its principle or primary effect must neither advance nor inhabit religion, and the statute must not foster excessive government entanglement with religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.192" offset="1752117">The appellants here, as below, offer no challenge as to the secular legislative purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.041" offset="1791510">However, the appellants do challenge the statute on the grounds that it promotes excessive government entanglement with religion and that its primary effect is to advance religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.874" offset="1838844">I would like to first turn to the issue of entanglement, and running through any analysis of entanglement according to this Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="475.308" offset="2004565">Yet, the lower court plainly found that at least certain vestiges of church-relatedness remained.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.462" offset="2105189">These included religious symbols on the facades of buildings and inside some of the buildings.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.102" offset="2143745">These included the financial support of a certain council which operated for religious purposes within Western Maryland College.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.535" offset="2185437">Financial support was not a major item, but it was there and Western Maryland agreed not to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.130" offset="2211873">It included a direct tie-in to the sponsoring church and the furnishing of certain reports to that church.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.116" offset="2375817">I do not recall other specific instances, but the settlement agreement also included a general provision that Western Maryland College would remain totally neutral as to the furtherance of spiritual development of its students.</text>

            <text syncTime="767.536" offset="3173492">Turning to the first variable, the character and purposes of the institution, the lower court expressly held that the schools here confirmed in character and purposes to those schools which were approved for aid in Tilton versus Richardson in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.807" offset="3250501">However, running through its opinion, are, I submit, two distinctions between these schools and the Tilton schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.279" offset="3292402">In Tilton, this Court employed as a foundation the absence of any restriction based upon religion, upon faculty appointments.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.239" offset="3344229">In respect of these schools, the lower court expressly found that there was a policy or practice at least in part of faculty recruitment based upon religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.925" offset="3398981">More specifically, Loyola College admittedly, and as the lower court found, has the policy of attempting to recruit to its faculty each year two members of the Sisters of Mercy and two members of the Society of Jesus, both of which are sponsoring religious orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.737" offset="3474318">That is not to say that if Loyola is unable to find members who are qualified, they will not turn to people of other religions and hire them.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.400" offset="3520921">Nonetheless, their affirmative policy is to recruit members of these religious orders and, it is appellants’ contention that to the extent Loyola or any other school has a policy of recruitment at least in part based upon religion, it necessarily has the corollary policy of not recruiting people from other religious backgrounds and those of the sponsoring order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1041.976" offset="4271262">And the College of Notre Dame and Mt. St. Mary’s College had percentages, as I recall, which were in between that is of clergy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.649" offset="4365930">Now, the College of Notre Dame and St. Joseph College, as the lower court found, also have practices of recruiting faculty based upon religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.105" offset="4407726">The lower court found that reason for this was budgetary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.602" offset="4421727">That is, that it involves less expense to the schools involved to invite and receive through their faculties, members of these religious orders than independent persons and that was the reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.965" offset="4483167">There is another major distinction between these institutions and those which were involved in the Tilton versus Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.325" offset="4524650">In Tilton, this Court pointed out that theology was taught academically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.834" offset="4550668">This was based upon a stipulation by the parties to Tilton that theology was in fact taught academically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.959" offset="4579193">There was no such stipulation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.877" offset="4590792">As I have indicated earlier, the Court had considerable difficulty with the whole question of theology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.563" offset="4617541">It found itself unable to characterize one way or the other whether theology was taught academically or religiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.574" offset="4649620">However, it did recognize that given the limited selection of courses at these schools and given that this limited selection was focused upon Christianity and given that the courses were taught by Maryland, and in some cases, exclusively by clerics of the sponsoring faith, there existed at least the potential that theology could be used to further the secondary purpose of these institutions, that is, the religious purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.517" offset="5033411">That is teaching religiously.</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.262" offset="6548408">Now, in fact, each of the appellees, as the lower court found, had a practice of prayer in the class.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.520" offset="8361411">The lower court specifically held that the difference between the so-called general purpose grants, as are involved in this case, and special purpose grants, as were involved in Tilton versus Richardson, are constitutionally insignificant, but only point out that no prior case decided by this Court involved aid in such a broad form as is offered by the State of Maryland.</text>

            <text syncTime="2699.876" offset="10902811">I think there is at least a difference in a way church-related institutions that operated those levels have dealt with the education of students in the two different environments in the way that that has evolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.360" offset="10960803">I think there is also a significant difference wholly apart from the way the institutions have approached it because of the age and the maturity and the intellectual freedom, the sense of the economic freedom on the part of the student bodies, that I think makes the two backgrounds and the two settings substantially different and I think that was explicitly recognized in this Court’s plurality opinion in Tilton and later in the opinion in Hunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.658" offset="11053904">In Maryland, less than one-third of the institutions receiving aid under the program are church-related and have been found by the lower court to conform closely to the colleges considered by this Court in Tilton versus Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.898" offset="11106880">The original version of our statute was passed by the state legislature in early 1971, in obvious response to the growing financial needs of private colleges and universities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.480" offset="11145228">In establishing a grant program that was not limited to one particular type of aid, such as capital grants for bricks and mortars, but rather permit flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.307" offset="11180545">The state was codified in funding a sound educational policy that remains extremely important to the state as well as the colleges today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.206" offset="11212101">A policy which recognizes that different institutions have different financial needs from year to year and that if the state should respond to those needs as they evolve rather than locking all colleges in to a particular type of aid which may be artificially and unsoundly applied, satisfy contrive rather than real needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.521" offset="11289424">Shortly following the original enactment of Maryland’s program in 1971, this Court decided Tilton v. Richardson, upholding the federal capital facilities grant program there at issue, but holding that any funds paid to such colleges were constitutionally required to be paid subject to an explicit and permanent prohibition against sectarian usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.518" offset="11369358">Maryland responded immediately by amending its statute to include such a provision and by conferring certain responsibilities and powers in connection with the administration of our program upon the Maryland Council for Higher Education, a body already charged with substantial responsibilities and information gathering functions in the field of higher education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.554" offset="11449502">As Mr. Greenwald has mentioned in his argument, the Establishment Clause in cases such as this breaks down into a three-part test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.252" offset="11480326">Secular legislative purpose served by the statute about which there is no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.296" offset="11496522">The primary effect test and thirdly, the requirement for the government to avoid excessive entanglement with religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.653" offset="11525884">There is an inevitable tension between the primary effect and the excessive entanglement restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.820" offset="11550648">A tension of which, we submit, the state and the Maryland Council are very much aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.865" offset="11570815">In essence, it is necessary for the state to avoid the payment of aid to a sectarian institution or to assist a specifically religious activity in an otherwise secular setting, to use the Court’s words in Hunt, and to do so without involving itself in an excessively entangling relationship with religion, where a school is pervasively sectarian, as has generally been the case with the primary and secondary schools which have been before the Court, a guarantee of no advancement of religion is required and almost invariably, the difficulty of separating the secular from the sectarian both makes it impossible to avoid aiding religion and require as a quantum of oversight which is necessarily excessively entangling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.058" offset="11743536">But where institutions such as the institutions involved in this case, are not pervasively sectarian and are generally characterized by strong elements of academic freedom and discipline rather than religious indoctrination, limited sectarian activities can be separated from the dominant secular element and the problems of avoiding aid to the sectarian part are greatly simplified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.104" offset="11835696">This, I would submit, is far more likely to occur at the college level.</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.092" offset="12055647">If an institution is using state funds to pay teachers in its home economics department that, as far as the Maryland Council is concerned, is perfectly permissible, but it would not be permissible for the institution to use funds for a teacher in a religion department.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul R. Connolly</label>
            <text syncTime="3709.506" offset="14941342">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.974" offset="14967255">The role of colleges, insofar as the future is concerned in this case, is reduced now to three.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.661" offset="14994005">As was disclosed this morning before lunch, Western Maryland College which was the Methodist church-related college has settled, one of the four Catholic colleges is now in the process of liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.017" offset="15051370">So, if we speak to the future, we have merely three appellees: Loyola College of Baltimore, Mt. St. Mary’s College of Emmitsburg, Maryland, and Notre Dame of Maryland which is predominantly a women’s college in Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.308" offset="15116571">If it would please the Court, I think that the plaintiffs’ case here has two main failures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.730" offset="15154292">One, his entire brief and largely his argument this morning, except in response to questions of Mr. Justice Blackmun failed to distinguish between the types of school systems who were the beneficiaries of state aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.977" offset="15223255">This Court, in the last five years, has written opinions in eight cases with respect to governmental attempts to provide aid to private school systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.401" offset="15268917">In six of those cases, it has found aid in all its forms impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.236" offset="15296294">Every one of those cases showed as a fact that the beneficiaries of that aid were large parochial school systems which the District Court, in dissent, so found to be an integral part of the religious mission of the Catholic Church and in nay question found that they practiced restrictions on admissions, restrictions on faculty hiring, that they were under the control of the governing Bishop of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.711" offset="15438191">These colleges are not, these are independent schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.731" offset="15462224">They respond to no ecclesiastical authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.685" offset="15478106">The evidence is clear with respect to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.298" offset="15492526">The second thing that the plaintiffs in this case do, is they largely ignore the very detailed findings of fact which were made in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.882" offset="15546860">This was not a case that come to this Court on abbreviated record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.124" offset="15563788">The plaintiffs used the full panoply of the discovery powers of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.266" offset="15592418">Hearings were conducted over a six-week period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.249" offset="15604330">Over 2,000 pages of testimony were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.285" offset="15620421">Proposed findings of fact were submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.662" offset="15634005">The District Judge assigned to gather the facts published tentative findings of fact, heard arguments again, and then made the findings of the fact which were adapted by the Three-Judge Court, including the dissenter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.477" offset="15693251">So, we have had plenty of due process insofar as fact finding is concerned and if Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure had any meaning, I think it should mean that these findings should be respected on appeal unless found to be clearly erroneous and I think there has been no attempt to do that before this Court or in the briefs and as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out and Mr. Greenwald agreed with it, there was an obligation on the part of the plaintiffs to carry their burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.973" offset="15835252">I think it is instructive, if we remember that this Court’s plurality opinion, which I think has become the majority opinion in Hunt, developed several criteria for testing whether or not the schools which were the beneficiaries of the federal aid program in Tilton were pervasively sectarian or had a predominant secular mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.061" offset="15959595">And these, Gentlemen, are the findings of the District Court with respect to these colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.827" offset="15986658">One; not only has there been no showing that religion slants the conduct of classes at the defendant institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.772" offset="16018423">This litigation has demonstrated the opposite to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.869" offset="16034828">Two; none of these facts, respecting prayer, impairs the clear and convincing evidence that courses at each defendant institution are taught according to the academic requirements intrinsic to the subject matter and the individual teacher’s concept of professional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.477" offset="16109224">Three; there was potent evidence, in the Court’s words, of academic secularity in the uncontroverted testimony of numerous members of the faculty of each defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.344" offset="16156663">They feel no religious pressures by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.930" offset="16171082">On their classroom presentation or their selection of text and course materials, each defendant subscribes to the 1940 Statement of Principles of Academic Freedom, the American Association of University Professors, and each obviously abides by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.369" offset="16236806">Four; while the District Court did not make any finding as to the student attitude, there was no evidence to contradict the Tilton observation about the maturity and skepticism of the average college student.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.835" offset="16286648">Indeed, there was much testimony supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.504" offset="16297306">One of the professors of theology said “the kind of questions, if you want to meet unbelievers, come and talk to my students.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.723" offset="16334191">Five; the Court said thorough analysis of the student admission and recruiting criteria of each defendant demonstrates the student bodies are chosen without regard to religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4145.502" offset="16685381">It is not an absolute scholarship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.863" offset="16690815">It is a tuition forgiveness program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.779" offset="16702413">Obviously, since that is a test, whether that should be a parochial school teacher or you would be a member of the sponsoring religious group, these state funds should not be used for that purpose, and there is no evidence that that ever took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.959" offset="16751105">The only school that ever gave the scholarships was not Notre Dame of Maryland, but it was Loyola College, and there is some confusion in the plaintiffs' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.263" offset="16792379">If you read it too quickly you would think that the scholarship program is the scholarship program that favored members of religious groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.448" offset="16817143">That is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.352" offset="16832712">Again, the District Court said at no defendant was there such dominance on the faculty by one religious group that hiring bias would escape the attention of members of other religious groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.725" offset="16882240">The faculty members impressed the Court as professionals who value academic freedom and see no place for religious bias in liberal arts education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.647" offset="16921946">If there were an effort to stack its faculty with members of a particular religious group, it could not have escaped the attention of the present faculty who would have made a complaint to the association, local chapter of the association of university professors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.809" offset="16978580">Questions were asked this morning about the composition of the faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.742" offset="16994253">We cannot tell with respect to Mt. St. Mary’s because Mt. St. Mary’s keeps absolutely no records whatsoever that would identify the religion of its faculty members.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.382" offset="17032810">Loyola faculty, of its full-time faculty 60% are Catholic, and of its part time faculty 50% are Catholic, and the overall faculty average is 56%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.122" offset="17079830">It is in the same range, although I am not as familiar with the figures with respect to the other college, Notre Dame.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.029" offset="17111386">The District Court continued with respect to these colleges, no aspect of the student conduct code at any defendant institution has any religious content.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.770" offset="17162377">None of the defendants require attendance at any religious exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.724" offset="17186201">Finally, that none of the defendants is religious indoctrination a substantial purpose or activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.262" offset="17212323">While each maintains a chaplaincy program which serves to encourage spiritual development of the students which is admittedly a secondary objective of this defendant has not, does not as this encouragement go beyond providing the opportunities for occasions for religious experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.175" offset="17280033">As most important information by the District Court, because the plaintiffs’ brief in this case is lauded (ph) with references that the secondary objective of these schools is to provide religious encouragement and development for these students.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.769" offset="17350354">My friend neglects to add the qualifying language made with the District Court, namely, that in no instance does this go beyond making religious services available to the students at their willingness to attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.754" offset="17418377">Only in one respect, if the Court please, do the District Court findings in this case depart from Tilton, and that is, with respect to the teaching of theology and religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.772" offset="17482429">In the Tilton case, there was a stipulation which I think will be impossible to be obtain in the future because the prominence that the observation was given in the Court’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.825" offset="17530599">There was a stipulation that the theology courses of the four Connecticut colleges were taught as an academic discipline and not with the purpose of inculcating religious values.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.438" offset="17577097">No such stipulation was obtained here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.051" offset="17587546">Extensive evidence was taken with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.682" offset="17602070">The District Court said that it was unable to determine how theology was taught.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.940" offset="17647105">That determination was based on two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.127" offset="17659853">He said he did not think it was legally permissible for him to make such a determination, perhaps referring to this Court’s prior opinion in United States versus Ballard where this Court should not interfere with theological views that are being expressed within various religious bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.569" offset="17729548">He said he was also generally unable to make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.781" offset="17750446">For whatever reason, we do not know why he avoided making that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.191" offset="17776046">Clearly, he made a specific finding that he was not making a finding that it was taught in a sectarian manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.780" offset="17810423">But having, as many District Judges do, an ability to accommodate their judgments to the practical necessities at that time, the Fact Finding Judge recommended that the Three-Jude Court ordered that theology and religion courses be carved out of the state program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.095" offset="17923690">In other words, it sustained the constitutionality of the state program providing that no funds were used to support the departments of religion and theology.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.810" offset="17974576">Mr. Justice Rehnquist and Mr. Greenwald had a colloquy this morning about how theology can be taught academically.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.652" offset="18009894">It may be a difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.715" offset="18018149">We do not agree with the District Court’s finding in this respect, but we can live with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.313" offset="18040614">It certainly is a nice accommodation to the entanglement point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.653" offset="18057959">It obviates a necessity for any class monitors sitting in a class of religion or theology if you cut theology and the religion programs out of the course, as was done in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.072" offset="18119608">The District Court found, as a conclusory fact, that religious indoctrination is not a purpose of these institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.285" offset="18160464">Although each school has as a secondary purpose, the encouragement of the spiritual development of the students, at none of these schools does this encouragement go beyond providing opportunity for religious experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.914" offset="18206962">The religious programs at each school are separable from the secular programs and the latter are the only beneficiaries of state aid that led the District Court immediately to the next point of the opinion, namely, the question of entanglement.</text>

            <text syncTime="4731.384" offset="19028878">By virtue of those findings, the District Court said because of the nature of the recipient schools, there is no necessity for state officials to investigate the conduct of particular classes or educational programs to determine whether a school is attempting to indoctrinate the students under the guise of secular education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.501" offset="19109335">Now that, I think, is quite obvious because you see, one of the reasons I think the plaintiffs have so acidulously avoided talking about the college system against the parochial school system is, again, the language of the District Court which said what would be impermissible at an institution staff by members of a particular faith administratively controlled by a religious body and dedicated to the inculcation of a particular faith may well be permissible in an autonomous institution staffed by faculty, hired on the basis of academic merit where academic freedom prevails and where courses are taught in accordance with the requirements of an academic discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.943" offset="19291043">It is our submission, if the Court please, that despite the articulation by this Court of the three-part test to determine whether or not governmental aid programs may include, among their beneficiaries, church-related schools that all of them really reduce themselves to a single one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.310" offset="19372545">What is the basic nature of the institution involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.947" offset="19395115">Obviously, as the questioning brought out this morning, there is a rather extensive relationship between state and schools, not only in the State of Maryland, but indeed, in every state, each of these schools must pass accreditation procedures, both for the state and by other quasi governmental bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.214" offset="19480170">Indeed, the record shows in this very case in alluding to the prayer issue that St. Joseph’s College was actually monitored for its religious content by a state accreditation agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.532" offset="19549446">It wanted to see whether the nursing school there was sufficiently a professional to merit accreditation, and they sat in the class and noticed no religious content in the subject matter that was taught.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.554" offset="19609528">At any rate, there is an extensive relationship that goes on all the time between educational institution and the state agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.050" offset="19643487">Absolutely nothing wrong with this, if these institutions are educational and not religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.087" offset="19675670">As we read this Court's prior opinion, the excessive entanglement test is not to be applied just because an institution has some church connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.993" offset="19723317">It is an interference with the religious aspects of a church-related institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.242" offset="19752261">All of us are obviously familiar with the extensive use of Hill Burton Funds that goes to the nation’s hospitals, many of which are run by sectarian or sectarian in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.710" offset="19794162">There is an ongoing relationship between state health authorities, state certifying authorities in that institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.078" offset="19827598">It is not the fact that the state has a contact with a religious institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.856" offset="19846720">It is whether the state has a contact with the religious aspects of that institution and as long as you have institutions as these are which are found to be psychic, which are found to have a religious dichotomy to them where their religious aspects are separable and can be perceived to be separate, then the fact that the state has some oversight with respect to them is not entanglement.</text>

            <text syncTime="5042.966" offset="20275233">They turned over the administration of the school to the plaintiffs and that is unfortunate, but they did it but that is not a necessity, especially as long as this Court sits and could look at the record that was made in this Court and apply the principles which we say, have already been articulated in the two cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="5075.796" offset="20406472">Aid really is of two kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.670" offset="20417966">Some aid is frankly religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.978" offset="20431236">A chapel, a chaplaincy program, religious books and tracks, these schools cannot use state money for that, but neither can Johns Hopkins, or Hood, or Washington College, nor the other schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.887" offset="20486824">They must account to the state and show the state that they are not using it for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.795" offset="20510544">Other aid, however, becomes religious or assumes a religious coloration only by virtue of the environment in which it is placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.302" offset="20544503">And then, when we look at the environment, if we see the environment is a predominantly secular one where the inculcation of religious values is not the purpose of the institution then, it seems to me, that the aid then becomes neutral.</text>

            <text syncTime="5168.334" offset="20776679">He is one of the officers of the American Association of Colleges who testified to the practice of private colleges throughout the country in conducting religious programs and conducting courses in religious studies and theology.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.035" offset="20839477">Interestingly enough, he found that the better class schools, if you would rate them on the Carson Berimbau (ph) scale of selectivity that there is an absolute correlation really between the better schools and those that have religious studies and theology programs in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.324" offset="20904575">And, he testified that the religious programs and the courses in theology and religious studies that are taught at these schools did not differ at all from those of the great majority of American private colleges throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.921" offset="20987017">This is a program that has a bit of genius in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5261.495" offset="21149290">It has left it in terms of the ongoing dialogue which takes place between the state agency, the Council on Higher Education, and the school so that these programs can be flexible and can meet the needs of the individual schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.214" offset="21212193">The record does not show that the state has been insensitive to administering this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.230" offset="21228284">We now have a set of written rules and regulations which have lately been filed with the clerk by the Attorney General’s Office.</text>

            <text syncTime="5297.863" offset="21294740">The schools are admonished to apply what is called fund accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.473" offset="21317205">Fund accounting is well-known to colleges and universities because colleges and universities, for years, have had to account for trust funds and for endowments.</text>

            <text syncTime="5315.998" offset="21367360">The state admonishes these schools to treat the aid funds in the same way as endowment funds and to leave an audit trail so that a readily identifiable audit can be shown as the purpose for which these funds were used.</text>
