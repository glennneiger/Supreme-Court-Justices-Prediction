            <text syncTime="51.940" offset="311104">This is the first time I am on Church case.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.911" offset="323016">A review of a decision of the Illinois Supreme Court which in our petition we charge that that decision of that Court violated the First Amendment, the separation of Church and the state provisions and the right of free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.734" offset="402219">May I say that, Mr. Justice Walter Schaefer did not participate in that decision, having excused himself because of the fact that his son-in-law is one of the partners in our firm?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.139" offset="459897">Now, what the Supreme Court of Illinois did in this case and I will have to recite some basic facts, I know the Court has studied the briefs, but to put the two issues in perspective that is the issue of the suspension, demotion, a removal and then defrockment of the Bishop Dionisije as to one and secondly the reorganization of the diocese and to three dioceses relating to organizational matters, the discipline of the Bishop Dionisije, the discipline area as distinguished from organization area.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.412" offset="628962">Now, the Illinois Supreme Court construed the constitutions of the Church, the Mother Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church and of the Diocese of the United States and Canada and construed the penal code, various regulations of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Mother Church which by the way all Courts have said we have considered this matter, including the Illinois Supreme Court as a true hierarchical church and I will spend no time on that unless that issue is raised in the reply argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.179" offset="776083">In construing those internal regulations and the constitution, the Illinois Supreme Court --</text>

            <text syncTime="182.772" offset="834389">It is not and that is included in the briefs that we have filed to which I will point, I hope during the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.301" offset="880573">In that result of the Illinois Supreme Court having looked into the regulations, looked into and construed them differently from the way the Holy Assembly of Bishops which is the highest diocese authority in the Serbian Orthodox Church and held that the defrockment of Bishop Dionisije, his suspension in May 1963, his demotion or removal as a Bishop of the Diocese in the Summer of 1963 was arbitrary action within the decision of this Court in the Gonzalez case of which you, Mr. Justice Brennan were the author on behalf of the full Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.560" offset="1065520">So that the net result of the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court was to restore as a Bishop of the Serbian Orthodox Church, this suspended, removed, and defrocked person and as to the reorganization of the diocese that the Court just says out of hand without citing any authority whatsoever, not a single authority, that the Holy Assembly of Bishops may, despite the fact that is the highest body in the church and despite the fact that only it and only it might create dioceses and only it may end the diocese, only it may reorganize the diocese, that is Article 16 of the Church Constitution that that was improper action.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.047" offset="1339492">It is one of 14 Great Worldwide Orthodox Churches and only -- the constitution provides, the constitution of the diocese which is introduced here as a matter that must be discussed, writes expressly that only the Holy Assembly of Bishops which is the same position of the College of Cardinals in my Church and the Catholic Church, those two highest diocese authorities may only appoint bishops, they remove bishops and it may only appoint diocesan bishops for a particular diocese in the congregation or parishes where people in that diocese have no say with respect to the appointment of those particular bishops.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.241" offset="1876256">Civil Courts, said this Court in Watson v. Jones, are limited to accepting the decision of the highest adjudicative authorities in a hierarchical church and may not inquire into the decisions made by those authorities and once made, they must be accepted by the Civil Courts in Gonzales which came along at a later point.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.175" offset="2004047">There was this statement in the opinion, in affirming and adapting and reaffirming Watson v. Jones, the Court said that this was true except possibly was the dictum, if there are elements of fraud, collusion, or arbitrariness involved in the decisions of the highest body of the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.445" offset="2113135">This Court also said that that had very narrow reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.019" offset="2127450">There was no occasion and the Court did not apply that particular doctrine or gloss upon Watson v. Jones in that particular case nor has this Court done it any other case.</text>

            <text syncTime="745.394" offset="3084890">But one of the problems here is that we in America are thinking in terms of our own due process, our own procedures and we are inclined to impose or not necessarily impose, but we think in that fashion and when we are looking at allegations, whereas we are really not permitted to do that under Watson v. Jones and if -- these cases usually come up in property cases, involving property.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.844" offset="3198679">This case involves property only in the sense that the original complaint filed in this case by Bishop Dionisije and his followers sought to enjoin those loyal to the Mother Church from occupying the seat in Libertyville, Illinois and some other properties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.302" offset="6960521">I would like to briefly divide my opening remarks into three general areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.628" offset="6989882">One, I would like to address myself to the division question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.199" offset="7004093">Secondly, the hierarchical question which has been used in this case and then thirdly, the disciplinary proceedings against Bishop Dionisije, briefly, as to all three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.685" offset="7058114">First of all, we see the issues in this case as far as this diocese is concerned as a Serbian Corporate Diocese really congregational in nature which established a constitutional relationship with the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, Yugoslavia and if I refer to the Serbian Eastern Orthodox Church of Yugoslavia from time to time as Belgrade, I intend any no more disrespect in that regard than when I refer to my own church as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.496" offset="7193324">So if I inadvertently use that term, please I am not, Your Honors, intending any disrespect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.007" offset="7219342">Under the terms of the relationship which existed between the American Canadian Diocese and the Belgrade Church, the Belgrade Church was provided the spiritual leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.402" offset="7272945">The American, Canadian Diocese, however, was as to its administrative, legislative and property was and according from the constitution which is approved by the Belgrade Church, have full administrative freedom was to independently rule and regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.245" offset="7352358">Now, I quote from what the Belgrade Church when it approved that constitution, we hope that you have “complete autonomous administrative freedom.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.279" offset="7400423">It is the only diocese in the Serbian Orthodox Church which owns its property free and clear of any interest by the Serbian Orthodox Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.158" offset="7451936">Its Congregations, each have a constitution and the diocese has absolutely no interest in the property of the Congregations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.432" offset="7501047">The American-Canadian Diocese controlled itself by means of a Church National Assembly, composed of some of the clergyman and representatives in the various congregations which they have from time to time called it Sabor (ph), and it and only alone could amend the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.331" offset="7568651">It is found in the Serbian Church Constitution, not in Article 14, which says these are the Diocese of the Serbian Orthodox Church and then lists all the dioceses in Yugoslavia, but it is in found in Article 15 (a) or it was found, it has not been found since May 10, 1963, but prior to that date, Article 15 of the Serbian Church Constitution said, in addition to those dioceses in a hierarchical respect is, sub paragraph 8, the American Canadian Dioceses of the United States of America and Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.189" offset="7716087">In 1963, the Belgrade Church, the Holy Assembly of Bishops, acting within its authority removed, the American, amended Article 15 (a) and since then the American Canadian Dioceses has never appeared in this Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.220" offset="7784214">In its place it put three new dioceses that were West, Midwest, and Eastern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.066" offset="7803545">It also at the same time, in effect, attempted to distribute the property of the three dioceses and place three spiritual leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.498" offset="7841370">What was the dioceses to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.216" offset="7848162">Two alternatives; they could go along with it or they could insist upon maintaining their own existence, their own integrity and their own property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.980" offset="7923290">There are three large pieces of real estate, one which is, just as there are incidentally three new dioceses, one lying in the East in Pennsylvania, called Shadeland and I cannot recall how many acres, but it has become a cultural center who serves in that area as an old folks home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.616" offset="7989745">The real estate in Libertyville, Illinois in Lake County which has a cemetery, the King Peter lies there, it has been there, it under the reorganized plan is to become the home of the Midwest Diocese and thirdly, there is a piece of substantial real estate in California owned by the diocese which they have accumulated over the years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2996.910" offset="12090970">Bishop Dionisije, a member of the Serbian Orthodox Church elevated to Bishop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.391" offset="12112913">In 1961, they adapted a penal code, penal procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.286" offset="12136423">As an incident, in our view, to their efforts to -- no matter what their motives were, to proceed against Bishop Dionisije, they sought first of all to suspend him, take the first step in the penal proceedings, then the second step they appointed an administrator who was just to keep the place from burning down while they proceeded with the penal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.933" offset="12223045">Practically, there was a great stir in the country among the people because of the division of the dioceses and the Sabor I think was (Inaudible) in council fired off telegrams to Belgrade and said, “Look, give Bishop Dionisije a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.998" offset="12287306">If he is guilty, he is guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3120.213" offset="12584162">I have two answers to that and perhaps the most important answer is, earlier in the brief they say, “Aha! The Court gave this case a trial de novo.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.654" offset="12685935">But let me answer the second part of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.374" offset="12700772">His conduct after made attempt, when he failed to recognize the division, since every Court has held that the division was illegal, I would find it rather unconscionable to support a judgment against him because he was right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.052" offset="12787499">Had they followed the rules, and strictly adhered to the rules, I think their judgment would be entitled to enforcement by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.110" offset="12823757">But as it stands now since they did not follow the rules, I think this Court has to say, I am sorry we are not going to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.828" offset="12850611">Now, you are not reinstating him as a bishop because there is no desk in the Holy Assembly of Bishops meeting the hall for the Serbian, for the Bishop of the American-Canadian Diocese.</text>

            <text syncTime="3384.146" offset="13639927">One, the American-Canadian Diocese is still a part of the Serbian Orthodox Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.586" offset="13673677">It is not a separate diocese.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.929" offset="13687051">When the Holy Assembly of Bishops reorganized the American-Canadian Diocese because it was becoming so large and so difficult to administer as Bishop Dionisije himself pleaded to the Holy Assembly of Bishops.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.339" offset="13748700">Instead of signing more bishops over, they divided the diocese into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.607" offset="13781719">The very three parts of Bishop Dionisije had organized as an Episcopal Divisions and in doing so, in the order, the final boundaries of the newly established diocese's revision of the existing church constitution for this territory in conformity with a newly created situation and all other questions relative to the clear ecclesiastical organization of these dioceses shall be studied by the Church National Convention here with the bishops in charge and there are motions submitted for final decision of the Holy Assembly of Bishops.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.688" offset="13942111">So what these holy men did, exercising sound judgment that will create three dioceses here to afford better administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.500" offset="13985370">You decide as stated in this order exactly what the boundaries of those three dioceses will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.554" offset="14013582">You review the constitution of the Canadian-American Diocese and recommend revisions of that constitution to apply to all three of the dioceses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.400" offset="14064887">That is what these people in Yugoslavia, these holy men said, “You are over in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.690" offset="14094039">We have trouble understanding quite what your laws are, but you do it and that is what was done.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.350" offset="14116714">Now secondly, the Illinois Supreme Court, the Illinois Appellate Court, every Trial Court that had considered this matter has said that the effort of Mr. Sullivan’s clients, Mr. Sullivan, a distinguished Illinois lawyer to withdraw the dioceses from the article structure was invalid and that this diocese is still there pending the ultimate disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.507" offset="14233324">Now, litigation pending for 13 years, the ultimate decision of affirming the creation of the three dioceses as a reorganization administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.125" offset="14279822">Now lastly, this diocese never had complete autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.863" offset="14306780">The constitution itself says for administrative purposes since the American-Canadian Dioceses and half a dozen others outside of Yugoslavia are mentioned in the article to which Mr. Sullivan refers, they have to have special provisions because we do not have, it is not the dioceses that are in Yugoslavia and we are close to them, we may administer them, we give you a large measure of administrative independence, but that constitution provides expressly and the constitution of the diocese provides expressly that all decisions of the Church Councils here must go to the bishop and be approved by the bishop and he in turn submit them to the Holy Assembly of Bishops for ultimate approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.444" offset="14505102">And all decisions with respect the this diocese and its administration, if the bishop disagrees, then those decisions made by the Sabors and the Councils do not go into effect until he agrees or until its submitted to the Holy Assembly of Bishops and the Holy Assembly of Bishops approve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.166" offset="14583992">So you have this analogous situation in the moment and this is going to be a few more words, the Holy Assembly of Bishop being placed in this position with schismatic seeking to withdraw from the Church and those Holy Men in Belgrade are holding the American-Canadian Diocese as unit, pending disposition to this litigation, commenced by the schismatic in the Summer of 1963 and they having appointed now Bishop Firmilian as the administrator, pending the disposition to this litigation with the Holy Assembly in the hopeful deference to this Court and to all other courts until it is finally decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.866" offset="14786807">It is a sort of a morphacy (ph) that the diocese is a whole exist pending this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.394" offset="14820870">The division of the diocese also exists to bring eventually the council of the diocese and then it says council, it does not say there in that order that you shall call Sabors in each of the three dioceses, you shall call a council for the whole diocese, report back to us how you need this constitution revised so that this may all be settled and you may go on administering with three bishops instead of one bishop.</text>
