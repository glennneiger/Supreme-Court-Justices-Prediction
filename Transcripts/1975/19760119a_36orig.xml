            <text syncTime="79.192" offset="420070">But the only two lines that are still viable and in contention are the Texas so-called middle line or median line, which begins at the mouth of the River Sabine, the natural mouth of the River Sabine and extends gulfward three - leagues on a middle line or median line principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.825" offset="526649">Which we believe to be the only correct and equitable line that will fairly divide the territorial sea between these two states which is all we seek to do, which is all we can seek to do here is just fairly divide this territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.045" offset="1647511">It is a very important point in this case, which was overlooked by the masters, consistently overlooked by the United States and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.151" offset="1679903">Your decree states that Louisiana may measure the breadth of the territorial sea from that Jetty, that decision has nothing to do with where the lateral boundary would be in their territorial sea or in our territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.970" offset="1743224">But we want to put it in here so you can see that the Louisiana territorial sea is rather unusual and that it comes on an arc and then joins in there, three miles lines, which of course they are taking under the unconditional grant of the Submerged Land Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.859" offset="1806754">They are taking three miles which they try to take a historic three leagues.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.918" offset="1850953">So you have a state on the one hand with a three-league grant already established by this Court, and Louisiana on the other hand with a three mile grant, but allowing them to measure that three mile grant from the eastern edge of the Jetty, under the Geneva Convention, holding that that was a part of their coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.327" offset="1936634">So that actually they a have a territorial sea on breadth, that is very unusual looking animal, as a result of those two cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.775" offset="2774434">I am sure the court knows why, and this title 's litigation we refer to the 1845-49 period is related to Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.744" offset="2802332">I will pick that up in a little while there is a very good reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.745" offset="2818319">As most everyone is written on this subject, to read this that we would deed it, this little flavor from the United States Government, from the west bank to the middle of the river in 1848, had the same standing historically by the very terms of the Submerged Land Act as our original historic grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.180" offset="2888014">So when I speak of 1845-49 that is why I am using that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.266" offset="2912360">The United States and Stanley agrees with the position that I just stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.932" offset="2931064">They agree that Texas had a historic three league lateral boundary, and they conceived this in their briefs, they argue with the fact that it was not precisely delimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.561" offset="2993549">We will get to that in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.275" offset="3004416">But the position of course, our basic position is based on a number of historic items and this has been so well documented in your previous cases that to get a little bit of posing on the court to go over all of it, I will try to hurriedly do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.507" offset="3085291">Of course, first the United States, a party to this litigation and the State of Texas, a party to this litigation, entered a stipulation that appears at 394 US 1 which was the third chapter of the second United States versus Louisiana Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.022" offset="3155403">And this is what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.220" offset="3164181">The United States has accepted Texas three-league boundary opposite the western half of Sabine pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.947" offset="3199080">Not as a boundary as it existed when the State came into the Union in 1845, but as one approved by Congress before the passage of the Submerged Land Act, and as such equally entitled to recognition under section 2(b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.340" offset="3268670">The land identified in the stipulation as the land to be recognized as Texas historic offshore boundary includes the 1849 extension, but the United States reserves the effectives of that extension as against the claims for example, as might be asserted by Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.654" offset="3365950">Alight, that reservation which carried out, Louisiana made a context of it, and that is what the original opinion in this case dealt with as to whether it was valid against Louisiana?s claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.135" offset="3427808">And this Court held that it was, that is already decreed law by this Court in the face of Louisiana?s contest, you rejected their claim of the west bank and judicially decreed Texas historic boundary to which the State of Texas and the United States had already agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.155" offset="3511923">So Louisiana?s contest has been rejected, and the stipulation of United States is still binding on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.889" offset="3538881">Now that historic boundary of course is based on a lot of historic documents, again as so hurriedly because it is so much a part of the previous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.628" offset="3581826">Our 1836 Texas Boundary Act was the fundamental historic document that from and after the passage of this Act, passed when we were an Independent Nation and a Republic, the civil and political jurisdiction of this republic (b) and is hereby declared to the extent of the following boundaries to with, beginning at the mouth of the Sabine River and running west along the Gulf of Mexico, three leagues from land to the mouth of the Rio Grande so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.371" offset="3708781">When Congress annexed us as a State in 1845, this mind you was the territory that the Republic of Texas considered that it was properly included within its boundaries, and rightfully belonging to the Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.262" offset="3780357">That beginning at the mouth of the River Sabine, three leagues gulfward to the mouth of the River the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.317" offset="3804599">What did Congress say when they annexed us?</text>
            <text syncTime="927.322" offset="3812644">That Congress does consent that the territory properly included within and rightfully belonging to the Republic of Texas maybe erected into a new State.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.366" offset="3852768">It did say, subject to the adjustment by this Government of all questions of boundary that may arise with other Government, you will remember the history that the United States was concerned about where the western boundary of our State would be, where the boundary would be with Mexico, and they wanted to press every claim that Texas rightfully had against all contestants and participants, and that is why that language was used, there was never any contest over our eastern boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.450" offset="3961124">Never, the only contest that is ever reasoned about is Louisiana's rejected claim that we did not own half of the Sabine River.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.753" offset="3998323">We came along to the treaty that we then entered into with Mexico following this series of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.862" offset="4034790">The language and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo said, the boundary line between the two Republic shall commence in the Gulf of Mexico, three leagues from land opposite the mouth of the Rio Grande and from that and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.068" offset="4095603">Three leagues river, there can be no question any longer about the fact that we had our historic boundary and there can be no question about the fact that that boundary included a lateral boundary, whether or not Congress said, when it said beginning at the middle of the River Sabine and to line three leagues, the mere fact that it did not stake it out by some call or some precise delimitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.122" offset="4223812">We believe that does not defeat the fact that Texas had and had to have a historic lateral boundary connecting that beginning point and that ending point at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.500" offset="4677297">If the line, had it originated on the west bank of the river instead of in the middle of the river, would it have been parallel under that principle to a line which originated in the middle of the river?</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.837" offset="4714705">Yes, but that would not be very much different, say academically if that is what we are deciding about in this case, we would not have very much to talk about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.952" offset="4751067">Because the principle of the line would be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.466" offset="4761203">It would just have a different connecting point that some maybe quarter of a mile to the west of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.124" offset="4783772">But you project the line exactly under the same principles, that we have spoken of as the middle line back at the time Texas was annexed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.419" offset="4817000">I will get to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.374" offset="4824837">But the only concept of any of so-called middle line or median line is that what you are trying to do is to divide the path fairly, that is all it is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.032" offset="4867469">You trying to go haywire, you are trying to do equity to both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.577" offset="4885650">No one denies that the Texas line shown on this map does that, no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.882" offset="4914803">The line is proper, it connects to our historic middle and it divides it in it an equitable way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.031" offset="4951479">When you take the United States line which is now been joined in by Louisiana, you use the jetties which were not developed on median principle lines at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.580" offset="4993588">They have nothing to do with equity of dividing a seabed, they were built by the United States Core of Engineer for the purpose of the United States Government in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.180" offset="5032040">They do not even purport to follow a median line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.743" offset="5046251">And when you move down and start at that position, you destroy the principles of median principle because you have such narrow baselines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.885" offset="5074881">It is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.862" offset="5082718">If you take two small baselines to construct a median principle out of that, you might as well just draw a straight line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.551" offset="5105497">It is going to come out substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.387" offset="5116886">So, unfairness is injected into this case by the use of man-made jetties constructed by the United States Corps of Engineers in 1880 when they were begun as to our historical boundary was already recognized, which did equity to everyone, and now we are put in the position that we are being said that we have given up part of our entitlement because in some way, we have acquiesced, we have acquiesced says the master, as his primary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.261" offset="5256380">The State of Texas is acquiesced in giving up this valuable land that would be ours under that principle because we have acquiesced in moving our boundary line down the Jetty to the mouth.</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Rupp</label>
            <text syncTime="1932.977" offset="7835188">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.884" offset="7850861">There is no longer any dispute between the parties here that the boundary between Texas and Louisiana and the Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.456" offset="7881163">It must be constructed by reference to the median line or equidistant principle contained in Article XII of Geneva Conventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.154" offset="7903942">That is that the boundary must be aligned that is at all points equidistant from the coastlines of the two States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.844" offset="7930692">The dispute relates instead to the coastline for purposes of application of the median line principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.625" offset="7965800">Texas? basic position is that the relevant coastline is the coastline that existed in 1845 when it was admitted to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.179" offset="8004043">In support of that position, Texas has contended first that the Congressional Resolution annexing Texas, recognized that Texas had in the Gulf of Mexico both lateral and offshore boundaries, that had Congress undertaken to fix that boundary as of 1845, it would have used the equidistant or median line principle and it would have applied that principle to the 1845 coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.256" offset="8108324">And finally that even though Congress did not fix the lateral boundary in 1845 or thereafter, the boundary nevertheless remanded inquit and neither post 1845 evulsive changes in the coastline, nor post 1845 changes in domestic and international law can operate to affect the position of a lateral boundary which has remained in some sense established since 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.427" offset="8229010">We believe that the special master properly rejected Texas? positions and that all three of the contentions made by Texas in support of that position, are demonstrably unsupportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.136" offset="8271851">The operative language of Texas relies upon in support of its argument that it has had for the last 140 years, a lateral boundary in the Gulf of Mexico, appears at page 7 of our brief, and it was referred to by my brother a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.551" offset="8333500">That language which is taken from the Texas Boundary Act reads as follows describing the seaward boundary of the State of Texas, beginning at the mouth of the Sabine River and running west along the Gulf of Mexico, three leagues from land to the mouth of the Rio Grande.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.630" offset="8409777">In United States versus Louisiana, decided by this Court in 1960, this Court held that the language to which I have just referred is sufficiently precise to sustain Texas? claim to an offshore grant under the Submerged Lands Act, extending into the Gulf of Mexico three leagues from land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.669" offset="8513954">At the same time however the Court recognized in that case that at the time of Texas? annexation, Congress paid little attention to the location or existence of any offshore boundaries for the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.003" offset="8579364">As the Special Master noted, Congress paid no attention at all to the location of lateral boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.234" offset="8612279">The consuming interests at that time were instead the question of slavery, the debt that has been accrued by the Republic of Texas, and our deteriorating relations with Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.766" offset="8654388">Texas has pointed to nothing in the available legislative history that add to the language to which I have referred, and I think that the special master, we submit that the special master was correct in concluding that it is impossible on the basis of operative language upon which Texas relies to construct the lateral boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.895" offset="8746861">As the special master noted, the problem is getting from the mouth of the Sabine to a point three leagues into the Gulf, and I am quoting,?no meridian is chosen, no angle of departure from the coast is referred to, nor is any point in the Gulf three leagues from land specified.?</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.385" offset="8812899">Given a total lack of relevant language in the statute, there is no indication of how or where a lateral boundary was to be constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.452" offset="8841111">What the special master was confronted with then, was a holding by this Court that Texas? offshore boundary, the breadth of Texas? grant under the Submerged Lands Act, extended three leagues in to the Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.800" offset="8902551">The instruments upon which it relied in arguing that it had an inquit lateral boundary, and that the responsibility of the special master was simply to divine that boundary, is that the language the relevant language provides no clue whatever to how that boundary was to be constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.208" offset="8980187">Events occurring since 1845 also demonstrate the weakness of Texas? position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.137" offset="9007877">I would like to refer the court if I may to a diagram that appears as an appendix to the special masters? report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.990" offset="9063257">Although Texas contends that it has had for the last 140 years an inquit boundary in the Gulf of Mexico, you will note from the map that when Texas undertook to define that boundary by statue, it fixed a lateral boundary which bears no relation to the lateral boundary it says has existed for the last 140 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.692" offset="9170045">The median line that Texas from the 1845 shoreline that Texas now suggests ought to be regarded to this Court, or adopted by this Court as its lateral boundary is marked as green line number one, on the special masters map.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.452" offset="9245069">The Texas statutory line is green line number three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.552" offset="9269519">The principles used to construct line number three and the principles that Texas now relies upon in constructing line number one are not the same and not surprisingly then the lines bear little relation to one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.483" offset="9341199">The second link in Texas? argument in support of its proposed boundary line we believe is no stronger than the first, and that is even if lateral boundaries were not defined at the time of Texas? annexation or subsequently, had the United States? Congress undertaken to define the lateral boundary as of 1845, it would have used the median line or the equal distant principle and it would have applied that principle to the 1845 coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.300" offset="9452481">We dealt with this contention at some length in pages 14 through 18 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.735" offset="9466274">Let me only say here that although the median line or equidistant distant principle is today recognized as the governing principle and the fixing of lateral boundaries between adjacent states that was not true in the 1800s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.729" offset="9534192">The instances referred to by Texas at Pages 25 through 28 of its brief are not instances in which the median distant principle was used to delimit areas in the marginal sea, with one exception and that is the (Inaudible) Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.228" offset="9604200">But that Case did not apply the median line or equal distant principle for which Texas contends here and which beyond the State of Louisiana agrees the proper principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.871" offset="9650803">The Court in that Case used the right angle principle --</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.919" offset="9663028">Does the median line principle, equidistant median line principle apply only when there is not only a dispute between two States or Countries but only when the line, you can not say the line is ever been definitely established before?</text>

            <text syncTime="2816.930" offset="11371018">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.486" offset="11385229">I would not try to duplicate the argument that has just been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.967" offset="11399126">There is one thing though that I want to clear up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.312" offset="11408530">I think it was Mr. Justice White, when we argued the last Texas boundary case asked Mr. McDaniel?s about the effect of that judgment on the offshore boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.032" offset="11459417">And Mr. McDaniel?s said, this is on page 34 of our brief, that is correct, it does not affect United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.311" offset="11488569">I do not think because as to United States, the three-league limit only comes as far as our historic boundary, and Congress has not consented for us to extend it here anymore than they have consented for us to extend it up here north of the 32nd degree of latitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.586" offset="11557637">So we have no contrary, so Mr. McDaniel was saying that in the extension of 1848 it really did not affect the offshore boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.381" offset="11600791">I think in this case, one of the salient facts that as I see is the fact that the jetty starts on the coast of Louisiana and it extends out in the Gulf, so it is an extension of the coastline of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.999" offset="11663276">And the master actually determined that the jetties were part of the river to some extent, because he said that in the expert testimony was put in justified the fact that you could say that was an extension of the river mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.791" offset="11742479">But he said he did not have to hold it on that basis because on Geneva Convention, it would be the coast of Louisiana to the end of the jetties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.558" offset="11781559">And they have the low water mark at the end of the jetties which about 1800 feet approximately what Mr. Hill said, and that was a baseline, which is a baseline for measuring the territorial sea of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.857" offset="11838714">And in under Article XII of the Convention, it is measured from that baseline, so I think that the master was absolutely correct in taking the modern coastline since you had never had a boundary established, it was maybe incorrect boundary, but the Texas never had recognized any boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.197" offset="11924083">As a matter of fact I think the record would demonstrate that all of these parties have treated, more or less down the center of the jetties as being the boundary between Texas and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.742" offset="11970267">Now, of course, we disagree about the fact that their median line is correct, because the special master in his report said that there was not enough of the Louisiana coastline of 1845 to justify the median line that Texas was suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.689" offset="12070055">So we take issue on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.775" offset="12078414">I think one of the things that I would like to cover before I get into that is this north, as it comes into the Sabine River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.150" offset="12111955">The Sabine River comes in the Sabine Lake, there is no dispute over the fact that that is three hours, Texas in their brief admit that when they were admitted in the Union 1845 that their boundary was on the western most branch of the Sabine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.374" offset="12184785">So at that time there is no question about where their boundary was, there is no question about the channel that was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.610" offset="12217699">Now in 1838, which was before Texas was admitted, the United States surveyed this land for the purposes of issuing patents and made townships out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.496" offset="12273288">And they surveyed it to the west branch of the Sabine River, and they let Louisiana select that land under the Swap Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.510" offset="12313307">Now the only reason Louisiana could select it was that United States treated that as being in Louisiana, and then Louisiana patent that land out to individuals who owned it today and pay taxes in (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.064" offset="12371612">Now one of the important things as far as Louisiana is concerned is that the same surveyor held all of these channels were navigable, so that meant that Louisiana owned the beds of those navigable streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.099" offset="12423753">Now what the master has done, he admits that these islands were patented to Louisiana and patented out by Louisiana, but yet he says that they are now going to be in Texas, so that means that Louisiana has given up these navigable waters and also they have given up this taxes on this private properties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3118.188" offset="12576099">Our position was we had a statute too, that defines our boundary, and it commenced at the head of the jetties and took a line across the jetties and went due south.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.375" offset="12624791">And the United States line, this was median line based on the line across the jetties and after the master decided that was a proper line we have accepted it, so we do not allege the line, and we were alleging to the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.822" offset="12686649">So the Master in making this determination about these operands about the right channel, said something about the amount of water that came through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.208" offset="12728132">But it is difficult for us to see, how the master could put the land that was already determined to be in Louisiana over to into Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.431" offset="12765017">And that is going to be the effect of this decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.369" offset="12772749">It is going to affect title to a lot of property, since it came through the swamp land grants to Louisiana and was patented out by Louisiana, I am talking about over a hundred years ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="3187.734" offset="12854251">In other words they were entitled as you know to select overflow lands in that porters, and they did that they made these selections and then they issued patents to individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.623" offset="12937843">But anyway the Master admits this was all patented to Louisiana, and there is no question of acquiescence on the part of Louisiana, because right now, they would be in Texas and Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.097" offset="12983714">As a matter of fact this same issue arose right north of that Orange Texas, what they call it aniurous, and they had two channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.177" offset="13024047">And the Department of Interior determined that the western-most channel was the channel to be used because that was the channel on the west bank at which the Texas boundary was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.563" offset="13077545">Now that is the whole position we take is that the channel on which the west bank of Texas boundary was, West bank of Texas boundary is the channel to be used and the line was only moved to the middle of that channel.</text>
