            <text syncTime="52.522" offset="313385">Presented before the Court today is the case of Imbler versus Pachtman which presents an issue which has been litigated many, many times at the Circuit Court level throughout the United States and that is the question of the immunity or the liability which falls upon a public prosecutor under the 42 U.S.C. 1983 Civil Rights Act and Statute where in this particular case, there has been an allegation in the complaint of knowing use of perjury and also presents the rather unique set of facts that prior to the initiation of this lawsuit, there has been continuous litigation throughout the California Supreme Court through the United States District Court in Los Angeles, U.S. Ninth Circuit and so forth where we have opinions which have determined and fixed that there was in fact knowing use of perjury and a writ of habeas corpus was granted under 22 U.S.C., 28 U.S.C., 2254 for this knowing use of perjury.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.021" offset="643364">It was due to inadequate briefing in my opinion on the lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.056" offset="663531">It was due to perhaps an over ignoring by the California Supreme Court of some of the things that are place in this case within the meaning of Napue versus Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.375" offset="900827">So I am basing it on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.610" offset="909709">Of course I do not have access to how the voting took place other than that, but I can assure this Court that within the meaning of 28 U.S.C, 2254, the same record was examined by the Federal District Judge in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.319" offset="972612">There is no new evidentiary hearings took place and based on that record, the opinion at 298 F. Supp. 795 was prepared and that opinion is accurate and accurately reflects what took place in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.383" offset="1020886">Those findings for that District Judge are more complete than the California Supreme Court and in fact are accurate situation that occurred here, and you know, I cannot force the California Supreme Court to make findings and they also, when they granted in order to show cause in the California Supreme Court, they restricted the inquiry by certain questions which narrowed down the scope that they were going to take a look at in the significant Napue versus Illinois situation that occurred in this case, was really ignored by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.075" offset="1143661">Namely, unquestionably, the prosecutor in this case knew of certain false statements that were being made by his witness and he chose not for whatever reasons he had at that time to correct them.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.475" offset="1197160">Mr. Hanson, all the merits of the habeas corpus proceeding may have something to do with this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="281.967" offset="1231224">The primary and cardinal question here is the extent of the immunity, if any, of prosecutors, is it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="290.768" offset="1266332">And I know that you took a back up position that even though there might be immunity in the normal situation, at least there should be an exemption when a Federal Court has found that there are correct and that there was a knowing used of perjured testimony, but the first and basic question is the immunity of the prosecutor, quite a part from the merits of this case, is that not correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="315.102" offset="1363717">Now, as to that particular situation, there is no question that the national ballot, if you count up all the cases that have gone one way versus the other way, overwhelmingly is against the petitioner in this particular case, just without question.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.989" offset="1431217">However, there has been some, in my opinion, correctly made inroads out of the U.S. Sixth Circuit in Ohio in the case of Hilliard versus Williams which again has been decided by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.294" offset="1476461">I do not have the new citation on it, but it went up on the damages the second time and the U.S. Sixth Circuit again affirmed that line of reasoning and sent it back to the District Court to more correctly determine damages about the $1.00 limit that was awarded at the time of the trial by the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.144" offset="1547932">So I think the situation boils down to what type of case are we going to permit this in?</text>
            <text syncTime="369.101" offset="1579697">I do not ask the Court and I do not think it is really necessary to ask the Court to say, yes, the floodgates ought to be opened to allow any sort of lawsuit to be filed against the public prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.551" offset="1617523">I do not think that is a situation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.868" offset="1626822">I think there are many safety valves that can be accorded here and still allow the suit to be filed on its merits and among them are certainly pre-trial hearings, whereby the District Judge would inquire into the merits of the case and inquire into what I believe to be the four things that must really be inquired in.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.576" offset="1705608">Number one, did he do a Good Faith Act? Number two, was his act within his discretion?</text>
            <text syncTime="407.986" offset="1735283">Number three, was it within something provided by law and number four, was it within his jurisdiction?</text>

            <text syncTime="683.525" offset="2837441">Now, in this particular case as the Court perhaps knows there has been numerous contentions made that it is going to open the floodgates to litigation and I say again there is numerous safety valves that really militate against this and I think the first one is that usually people, like in the position of Mr. Imbler, are seeking substantial damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.194" offset="2932109">They go to a lawyer and they say I want to do this.</text>

            <text syncTime="717.998" offset="2975263">I, therefore, would suggest to the Court that any lawyer would probably scrutinize himself the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.568" offset="3001594">He would try to make inquiries to see if he is chasing a comet that has no merit at all, just like a personal injury case that comes in to the office of a lawyer, he would examine it with diligence to see and I think that there is an immense safety valve to the bringing of these lawsuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.175" offset="3764057">Certainly the bulk of these cases, I think are correctly decided in granting immunity because the bulk of the things that happened are within the discretion of the prosecutor.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.314" offset="3904595">Now, certainly, that probably was a mere mistake on the part of the judge and was correctly thrown out and that was the 1963 case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1887.340" offset="7652644">The issue there is whether a suit could be brought in the state courts under the Federal Civil rights Act and if so the application of the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.488" offset="7689216">Under the California Tort Claims Act itself there would be immunity for discretionary acts and an absolute immunity for malicious prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.973" offset="7727250">And then in the California Courts they would be the General Common Law defense as to defamation and use of testimony at trial, but there is a special statutory remedy for person convicted with crime who is later pardoned and compensation can be provided under statutory scheme for portion of his sentence he served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.669" offset="7810006">So that is not a suit against the prosecutor to suit, a claim filed with the state under Penal Code Section 4900.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.281" offset="7852429">So there is a monetary scheme available without a suit being maintained under the California Law against the prosecutor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.402" offset="11912902">The reason I wanted to correlate the defamation immunity with this and judicial immunity and legislative immunity is alleged -- the rule in this Court has been that immunity under 1983 is really a question of statutory construction and the statutory construction has always proceeded from the fact that what the immunity was at common law applies under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.535" offset="12017497">So this court found that under the common law, there was absolute judicial immunity and applied it under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.622" offset="12045813">The same thing with legislative immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.745" offset="12054277">As to executive immunity, for instance, peace officers found that at the common law peace officers when he had a defense in good faith and reasonable cause and apply at that under 1983 and the same is true with Scheuer versus Rhodes and the Strickland case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.953" offset="12215087">-- which is the earliest case and it itself relates defamation immunity and the reason why defamation immunity is also important is defamation immunity intends to allow a counsel in the presentation of this case to be free from worrying about civil liability as to himself personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.976" offset="12291260">So it is defending the act of asking questions and presenting evidence at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.903" offset="12310904">Now, if you are going to turn around say 1983 though allows against state prosecutors, suits for the questions they asked and the evidence they present at trial, then you have undercut the defamation immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.312" offset="12364507">The only thing you cannot be sued for is defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.775" offset="12374434">So if you are private counsel, you are home free and clear basically because there is no other cause of action lying against you, but if you are a state official, unhappily, you will be subject to suits for everything you say or present at trial which means you cannot argue a trial without worrying about the fear of suit and I think this case is a good case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3415.910" offset="13766969">There is just so much volume of matters coming into that that if we go over there in the matter, we do not get in touch with them until some time later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.056" offset="13795495">So I do not know whether they did or not, but in fact he was not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.034" offset="13815452">He was not a witness and was not present at the habeas corpus hearing, but think of the impact on the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.086" offset="13851606">I think we are weighing here an enormous impact we will have on the process of criminal justice against a private claim for monetary compensation and if habeas corpus hearings are going to decide the right to monetary compensation, I think it would be only reasonable to assume greater interest in habeas corpus hearing by the civil attorneys with the people who are going to be represented there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.739" offset="13958290">I have no doubt that the county counsel for instance would want to start being present and the city attorney would want to start being present and sometimes that might be to the good, but it certainly could slow up the habeas corpus writ which has been the purpose of habeas corpus has been to decide lawful custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.061" offset="14027567">We would then be converting the writ to decide lawful custody into a precondition for a civil suit and you cannot do that without having a ramification from the civil lawyers coming in and I think that plus the fact that people will not have that benefit at all who would tend to eliminate the writ of habeas corpus as a proper terminate for civil liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3568.706" offset="14378130">But no, this is an historic common law immunity as to damages and as other forms of redress that still open to the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.031" offset="14427449">He can still get his usual remedy for criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.281" offset="14444481">The district attorney certainly is under severe restrictions, for instance, by the trial judge, jury instructions, mistrial granted and the difference, what characterizes the difference between this and the executive say in Scheuer versus Rhodes is basically the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.042" offset="14523475">And that is the distinction that what the prosecutor does in presenting cases at trial is subject to all the restraints of the Sixth amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.180" offset="14556076">There is an adversary there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.425" offset="14560987">There is an impartial judge, there is an impartial jury.</text>
