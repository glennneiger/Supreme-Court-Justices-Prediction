            <label>Mr. William A. Watts</label>
            <text syncTime="66.591" offset="369715">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.664" offset="377970">I am W.A. Watts; I represent the City of Charlotte and individual petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.731" offset="402212">We are here on the certiorari to review a decision of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.182" offset="424050">That Court has ruled that a municipality must grant union dues check off under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the alternative, establish certain standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.800" offset="482564">Lower courts have found that Charlotte has not established clear and fair standards to differentiate between the denial of dues check off on the one hand and the granting of six withholdings from employees pay for such things as Credit Union savings, insurance premiums and contributions to one charity, to name a few.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.873" offset="602832">Now we say that by this decision, the lower courts have effectively carved out and established a substantive right to dues check off.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.198" offset="648076">We say that is a right that has never existed before because there is no right to dues check off as we see.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.200" offset="680155">It has always been viewed as a privilege and even in the private sector of our economy, check off must generally be secured by bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.963" offset="727175">Nevertheless, in spite of this the Court has equated the two and as required some kind of standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.915" offset="758940">I think it might be important to the Court to that I very briefly recite to facts giving a rise to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.424" offset="785062">During October, 1973, Local 660, International Association of Firefighters, made up entirely of municipal firemen employees and five of their employee members who are officers of the Union brought suit in the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.693" offset="862071">The Allegation was that there was a deprivation of rights under the First and Ninth Amendments and under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.397" offset="916929">Now at the time this action was brought, there were approximately 351 dues paying Union members in the Charlotte Fire Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.021" offset="955381">This was out of a total of about 543 uniformed firemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.738" offset="986310">The Union, of course, alleged in the complaint that the serious practice was arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.765" offset="1014418">They claimed also that denial of check off made it enable, made the Union unable to obtain Group Life Insurance, to obtain Counsel and certain other things that the Union desired to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.117" offset="1067812">Now on the other hand, the City contended and tried to show, and we think did show, that the City had established not standards, but a policy, a policy of voluntary withholding from employee’s pay and the City contended that the dues, check off simply did not conform to the policy which the City had established.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.884" offset="1162898">Now, I might mention here that there were actually 14 items which the City permitted to be withheld, but out of that 14, seven of the items were required by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.012" offset="1219322">I am thinking of such things as income tax withholdings and certain other things that either the federal or state statutes require the City to withhold.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.337" offset="1260700">That left seven items that the City voluntarily withheld when they were not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.285" offset="1288494">One of these was a city sponsored deferred compensation plan that the City had established as a Fringe Benefit and indeed we say all of the withholdings were in essence a fringe benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.607" offset="1345755">Insurance premiums and this again was for a company that the City sponsored and as a matter of fact, the City paid part of the premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.486" offset="1385252">The premiums were -- all it was accident, health and also life insurance.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="328.315" offset="1416599">Well, that was negotiated or part of the contract of every independent of the negotiation?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_a_watts" startTime="335.253" stopTime="363.213">
            <label>Mr. William A. Watts</label>
            <text syncTime="335.253" offset="1444289">It was negotiated with a private insurance company and the City participated in the program of giving its employees this protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.819" offset="1490578">And that, of course, was withheld one of the things that the city withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.830" offset="1506669">US Savings Bonds was another.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.262" offset="1516387">United Way Contributions, the one charity that was permitted and that was available to all employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.613" offset="1545748">Now in spite of this --</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="363.213" offset="1556197">Would you say Mr. Watts that all of these items then were available to all employees?</text>

            <text syncTime="370.782" offset="1586499">Mr. Justice Blackmun, we would say that all of these were available for all employees within a single work unit, i.e. the Fire Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.929" offset="1631012">Now as a matter of fact, the District Court found that to be a fact, found that this was the City’s policy, and we do not dispute that; we think that it is a correct finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.944" offset="1687123">Now --</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="400.102" offset="1703737">What if employee of Fire Department said I want you to send $20 out of each monthly paycheck, ten of every two weeks if they paid that way to my church.</text>

            <label>Mr. William A. Watts</label>
            <text syncTime="415.916" offset="1766953">Mr. Chief Justice, we would say that that would not be possible under the policy that the City had established.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.191" offset="1796106">The reason we would say that that would not be possible or practical would be that, we all know that there are many, many churches and you would have to set up some kind of a withholding for each church, I assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.465" offset="1857128">So that would not conform to the policy because as we all know that our fireman belong to many, many churches, many religious organizations, many social organizations, many Fraternal organizations and the sole reason that the City had this policy was so that we could grant or the City could grant withholding as a fringe benefit if you will, as a convenience to its people but still keep it under rationale and, well, let us say within bounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.911" offset="2206960">Dues were never permitted to any organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.097" offset="2219707">There might be many unions involved just as there might be many churches and we would say that would not conform to the policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.664" offset="2437987">Before you go on that, you referred a moment ago to the District Court’s opinion and I noticed that the District Court in its opinion at Page 813 of your petition, commented that desire to discourage municipal labor organizations would, of course, be an impermissible reason for refusing to withhold moneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.825" offset="2526594">Do you have any idea why he said that?</text>

            <text syncTime="613.625" offset="2557836">If you will notice the only citation at the District Court or for that matter the Fourth Circuit talked about, was the Virginia case that involved segregation and the impermissible objective of bringing about or denying integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.411" offset="2632964">Now for that reason it would appear that the District Court believed that the City attempted to discourage the Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.229" offset="2672253">Well, certainly the State of North Carolina attempts to discourage Municipal labor Union by its statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.425" offset="2693046">Is that an impermissible purpose for the State of North Carolina?</text>

            <text syncTime="651.828" offset="2710600">We litigated that case some time ago in a Three-Judge Court and this was upheld, the statute was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.797" offset="2742470">It is 95-98, I do not know lately, yes sir 95-98.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.632" offset="2769846">It provides in essence that because of policy, a municipality may not enter in the collective bargaining contracts with the Union, and that Your Honor was upheld for what it is worth by a lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.842" offset="2838705">We believe that it is a permissible type legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.601" offset="2853751">Now getting back to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question here, there is not one scintilla of evidence in this record that the City has ever attempted to discourage unions other than the statute which controls the City.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.291" offset="3780471">There is a long, long history of unionism in the United States and the fact that union dues check off is very important to the union as a matter of security.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.439" offset="4973118">In Strazny (ph) against Grusauskas, the District Court for the Southern District of Georgia considered this case and commented on it in the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.519" offset="5013347">Specifically, the court there, the District Court declined to follow Local 660 for many of the reasons that I have just enumerated to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.150" offset="5051903">It was -- this case was considered also by the District Court in the Northern District of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.735" offset="5086280">And in that case again, the District Court refused to follow the reasoning of Local 660 saying among other things, that this would grant a right to municipal employees that was not available to even private employees because private employees has to bargain for things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.343" offset="5200697">So for these reasons, we say that this is an intrusion on the right of a city to govern itself. Of course, you can -- it is easy to argue well, the District Court has left you in out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.715" offset="5294215">All you have to do is make out some kind of standard, but Your Honor what better standard is there than the standard which the City has, a standard which treats everyone alike under the Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.557" offset="5349595">We believe that the City Council should be permitted to govern in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.073" offset="5803603">Your Honor, if I may start out by answering that question in this way, contrary to what Mr. Watts has asserted in Court today that is that the standard that the policy that the City uses is a policy to allow all employees in a unit any trial deduction where all employees and in a unit can participate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.640" offset="5905898">Now that is the policy that Mr. Watts is asserting here today and he is saying that the policy that the City has adopted and has followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.786" offset="5938499">Now if you will look at Page 2 of the petition you will see that the first question which was addressed to this Court reads: “Have petitioners by following a policy of allowing only payroll withholdings which benefit all of its employees established a rational basis etcetera.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.973" offset="6007253">Now the reason that is important is that the District Court in this case, found on Page A-10 that the practice had meant to allow those deductions which were available to all city employees, that would be employees of all of the departments in the city, or those programs that were available to employees within a single department and that would be the fire department for example, to allow deductions that were available in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.985" offset="6139224">And since the deduction that we request, i.e. deduction for union dues is available to all employees within the fire department, then the Court said, well, you can not deny this deduction; that is the deduction that happens to run to a labor organization while you are allowing other deductions that only run to or only to benefit people in a particular department.</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.929" offset="6779015">At beginning of the litigation we filed some interrogatories and in the interrogatory number four we ask the City to state the criteria which they used to decide which withholding to allow and which withholding not to allow, and when they answered that interrogatory on Page 14 of the Appendix, they did not set forth any criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.719" offset="6870235">They just said, “This is what we do.” Later on in the litigation, in an affidavit filed by the City Manager and an affidavit filed by the Personnel Director, they said, “Our policy is to allow those deductions which every employee within the city can avail themselves of.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.713" offset="6938153">Judge McMillan then looked at those things that they actually allow, i.e. those deductions of the 14, and we argued to the Court and it was obvious from the record, from the answers to the interrogators that there were certain deductions that could only -- that will allow that only employees in the certain department could benefit from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.669" offset="7010042">And our argument to the Court was, well if that is really the practice of the City, what they do, then we think we should be able to avail ourselves of that benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2945.490" offset="11885327">Because it would be illegitimately attacking this Union because it was an unfavored group, then we would be talking more about the First Amendment question that Justice White raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="2963.860" offset="11958783">Well, we would be then in this Court invoking the First Amendment Right of Association which was involved in the Atkins case to attack the sister statute of 95 based 98, that is 95 based 97, which be made it a criminal offence for a firemen to be a member of Union, and that was attacked in the Atkins case and that of course fail on First Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.331" offset="12060661">And I think that the statute or the policy will also have to fall on First Amendment grounds if the Union was picked out as one group and all other groups were allowed withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.038" offset="12115518">Then no other questions I would conclude.</text>
