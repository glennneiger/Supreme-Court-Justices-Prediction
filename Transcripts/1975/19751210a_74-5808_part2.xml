            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="88.322" offset="456643">Well that is not, is it the Davis rule?</text>

          <turn speaker="barbara_rutledge" startTime="92.839" stopTime="460.659">
            <label>Ms. Barbara Rutledge</label>
            <text syncTime="92.839" offset="474615">In the Davis case, this Court stated that actual prejudice must be shown in order to obtain relief from a statutorily provided waiver for failure to assert it in a timely manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.243" offset="528323">However, even if this Court would not conclude that actual prejudice need be shown as the Fifth Circuit did, the state respectfully submits that likewise was no showing of “cause” in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.144" offset="595928">As far as applying the rule of Davis versus United States, this logic that applied there applies with equal force to a state prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.543" offset="641485">This Court observed in Davis versus United States if time limits for attack in the jury composition are followed, inquiry into alleged defects maybe concluded and if necessary cured it before the Court, the witnesses and the parties that have gone to the burden and the expense of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.515" offset="721420">If defendants were allowed to flaw its time limitations on the other hand, there would be little incentive to comply with its terms when a successful attack might simply result in a new indictment prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.866" offset="778785">Strong, tactical considerations would militate in favor of delaying the raising the claim in hope of acquittal, with the thought if those hopes did not materialize, the claim could be used to offset in otherwise valid conviction at the time when re-prosecution might well be difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.551" offset="861541">That reasoning applies in a Federal or a State prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.483" offset="885260">If this Court should accept petitioner's position, I do not see any reason why that would have to be an attempt to attack a grand jury because under the facts of this case, all the defense counsel will have to say is he believed it would be wasted effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.345" offset="960702">In Henry versus Mississippi, this Court shows that it will look to see if a procedural rule serves a legitimate state interest and it is urged that the rule to attack a grand jury prior to trial serves interest of time and expense of court and witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.990" offset="1047219">This Court stated in Kaufman versus United States, plainly the interest in finality is the same with regard to both Federal and State Prisoners and that is what the state is seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.093" offset="1111690">Moreover, this Court observed in Kaufman, federal prisoners are no less entitled to such consideration than state prisoners.There is no reason to treat federal trial errors as less destructive of constitutional guarantees than state trial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.921" offset="1175010">Not to gave great exclusive effects to procedural defaults by federal defendants then to similar defaults of a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.762" offset="1206357">The state simply asks that the converse be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.209" offset="1232166">In an address to the conference of Chief Justices in 1964, Mr. Justice Brennan observed, if the states afford the prisoners, full and fair opportunity on direct or collateral review to raise and prosecute their federal constitutional claims as federal habeas corpus affords then the federal habeas corpus courts will have no need to intervene in the supervision of state criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.941" offset="1351076">The state is asking that they be afforded the same direct and collateral review as a federal prisoner, but that no harsher rule be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.010" offset="1407396">Except in the contention that the standards of Davis versus United States should be applied, we observe that the Fifth Circuit said that actual prejudice must be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.620" offset="1469776">They found that the Louisiana rule did not make any exception for a waiver, but they then grafted a provision that there should be a showing of actual prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.194" offset="1528081">It is submitted that the Fifth Circuit was eminently correct and that it is not unfair if you would find that this is a harsher rule than Davis to apply it since the statute of Louisiana was silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.762" offset="1586387">However, in the alternative, if this Court finds that something less was meant by cause, we found, we urge that this Court find that there has been no showing of cause in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.372" offset="1656813">It was observed yesterday that the issue here basically is, was there a showing of incompetence by counsel to justify a showing of cause for the waiver of the attack on the grand jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="408.123" offset="1735807">I submit that the record supports a finding that there was most competent and able attorney in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.177" offset="1776036">Petitioner urges first of all that Chief Counsel Mr. Turow was not a capable attorney and that he had not tried a criminal case, a capital case in 15 years and his basic practice had turned away from the criminal practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.171" offset="1867987">I submit that this is no showing of an incompetent attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.611" offset="1893796">There is nothing in this record that I can point to show Mr. Turow’s competence as an efficient, hardworking attorney, but on the other hand, I say there is --</text>

            <text syncTime="1074.012" offset="4399356">If it would be that status, he probably would not need an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.014" offset="4427360">So I would submit, even if you have to go as far as that you have to apply a deliberate bypass, even that was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.887" offset="4478873">So it is the state's position here that under the rule of comity, applying Davis versus United States to bring a case to finality, unless there is an exceptional showing by petitioner, there must be held that he has waived his right to attack a grand jury and that there has not been that showing in the case involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1780.317" offset="7224552">Yes sir, I understand that, but I think the important point is that Amadi’s responsibility was limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.612" offset="7257779">Now, if one looks at the totality of the circumstances in this case, one is left with the questions of, why was this motion not filed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.354" offset="7284738">There is nothing clearly stated in the record that shows it was a tactical reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.908" offset="7298948">One is left with the other factors which we say add up to the fact that there was no knowing an intelligent waiver by Francis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.328" offset="7332594">There is not deliberate bypass by Francis or his counsel, but if the test is not that of Fay versus Noia, if the test is one of cause then we say this record supports a proposition that cause have been shown.</text>
