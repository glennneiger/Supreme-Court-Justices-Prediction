            <text syncTime="21.249" offset="84950">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.688" offset="98743">This case was brought on January 2nd of this year, first business day after the effective date of the Federal Election Campaign Act amendments of 1974, which I will refer to as the FECA.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.412" offset="149629">It is about a declaratory judgment of unconstitutionality and a permanent injunction against the enforcement of major provisions of that law, the 1971, Federal Election Campaign Act in subtitle H of the Internal Revenue Code as amended by the FECA Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.570" offset="210233">Pursuant to the expedited review provisions, the case was certified to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, after a remand to the District Court for fact finding, a framing of the constitutional issues and a re-certification to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.950" offset="271778">The Court of Appeals and a three-judge district court considering always subtitle H, rendered their opinions on August 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.475" offset="305842">The majority below upheld the constitutionality of every major provision of the law, but one and that provision was not appealed and is not an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.126" offset="344503">The allocation of argument for both sides will be as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.828" offset="363311">I will discuss the statutory limits on campaign expenditures by political parties, committees and candidates, limits on contribution to political candidates and limits on independent expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.559" offset="410227">My colleague Mr. Gora will discuss the challenge to the Act's disclosure provisions and this afternoon, Mr. Clagett will argue the unconstitutionality of federal subsidies to political candidates and parties and of the Federal Election Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.379" offset="465502">For the Appellees, Mr. Friedman will discuss general principles and the disclosure provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.988" offset="495909">Mr. Cox will discuss the limits on expenditures and contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.457" offset="521822">In the afternoon, Mr. Cutler will discuss subtitle H and Mr. Spritzer, the constitutional alibi of the Federal Election Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.443" offset="561737">Let me briefly describe the statutory provisions relevant to my portion of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.129" offset="584516">Candidates for all federal offices are limited by Section 608 in the amounts they may spend for purposes of influencing on election.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.032" offset="624118">National committee and State committees of a political party, may make expenditures on behalf of candidates which are in addition to the candidate's expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.886" offset="655464">Section 608 (e) prohibits expenditures independent of the candidate in excess of $1,000.00 so long is they are relative to a truly identified candidate and advocating the election or defeat of such candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.245" offset="708963">The statute also limits contributions to candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.470" offset="721816">No person may contribute in access of $1,000.00 to any candidates for Federal Office and political committees registered for 6 months, which have received contributions for more than 50 persons and have contributed to 5 or more candidates for Federal Office may make contributions to individual candidates up to $5,000.00 each?</text>
            <text syncTime="198.875" offset="795481">Candidates may expend personal funds or the funds of their immediate family up to $50,000.00 in the case of a candidate for President, $35,000.00 in the case of a candidate for the Senate and $25,000.00 in the case of a candidate for the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.327" offset="849293">Certain incidental out of pocket expenses incurred by volunteers in excess of $500.00 would constitute a contribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.172" offset="1328588">Well, that is certainly true, but the definition of expenditure is for the purpose of influencing an election and that is a factual determination to be made in each case as to which election the particular expenditure was designed to, you know, was intended to influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.868" offset="1391386">So, that conceivably under the Act, I take it that expenditures prior to a primary, prior to a nomination can be said by the FECA, by the Commission, or by a Court interpreting it, to in fact, have been for the purpose of General Election.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.353" offset="1457319">One of the principles duties of the Federal Election Commission will be to allocate to make a determination which expenditures in particular cases are for the purpose of which election.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.930" offset="1507683">The parties disagree as to the extent of Congressional Power to regulate political communication under the First Amendment, but they all agreed on one thing, which is that a statute which intrudes in a delicate area of this matter must be non-discriminatory on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.267" offset="1581035">For if it were not the state would be able to regulate the unpopular and in effect regulate the content of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.891" offset="1607471">I want to confront directly in detail the contention that the FECA is not facially discriminatory, for there are several theory cases official unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.055" offset="1652193">Section 608 limits contributions to and expenditures by candidates as defined in Section 591, essentially if anything of value, given or employed to influence a federal election.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.128" offset="1708408">Title 39, U.S.C., Section 3210 which is on page 81 of our volume 3 of the appendix, that sub-section E and F explicitly makes explicit exceptions to the definitions of contribution and expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.677" offset="1786671">What the exceptions are, are funds used in preparing materials to be sent out under the frank as well as the postal value of sending it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.220" offset="1824810">Section 3210 (a) (3) defines the kinds of materials that maybe sent out under the Frank.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.329" offset="1849260">That describes a variety of relevant materials which clearly influence elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.858" offset="1867337">But most particularly, it includes “discussions of proposed or pending Legislation or Governmental actions and the positions of the members of Congress on and arguments for or against such matters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="479.599" offset="1918328">The only limitation is that Frank cannot be used within 28 days in election.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.284" offset="1945078">Now, since the presentation of arguments for and against actions by Congress obviously influence elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.074" offset="1972245">The effect is that Section 608 limits all contributions to or expenditures by challengers for purposes of mailings which debate governmental issues, while leaving totally unregulated and unlimited private contributions to incumbents to prepare materials which is then send out in unlimited amounts at government expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.548" offset="2054165">No party to this litigations so far as I know disagrees with this interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.942" offset="2075690">Indeed, even in the propose regulations of the Federal Elections Commission relating to office accounts, the Commission was at pains not to treat funds supporting the activities describe in Section 3210 as either contributions or expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.286" offset="2133055">The issue we raise is not whether a congressman should be able to communicate with their constituents.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.616" offset="2150400">The issue is whether Congress under the First Amendment made by law, limit the ability of challengers to communicate with the very same constituents without similarly limiting itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.271" offset="2193032">Of course, public officials need to communicate with voters, but so do challengers and if private contributions to challengers for use in mailing are to be limited, since they may corrupt or give the wealthy an unequal voice, then contributions to incumbents for the same purpose should also be limited.</text>

            <text syncTime="893.551" offset="3574178">The FECA also and this applies to all Federal races, officially discriminates against independent candidates for office by permitting party committees to support their candidates over and above the candidate expenditure limit.</text>

            <text syncTime="946.768" offset="3787024">The wealthy candidate on the other hand can support his campaign from personal funds, including large early initial loans to the campaign which can later be repaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.758" offset="3822968">No reason which would stand the scrutiny has been given to justify giving the wealthy disadvantage in communication with the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.331" offset="3853270">Fifth, we also claim to this facial discrimination for the statute to permit large contributions by political committees which have been registered for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.800" offset="3891200">They are permitted to spend five times as much other kinds of committees and we believe that provision necessarily will help groups which have permanent organization, which have continuous professional contact, namely organized interest groups.</text>

            <text syncTime="993.901" offset="3975523">They tend to be generated by campaign activities which will occur too late for compliance for the six months requirement and they tend to call it less only in response to unanticipated events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.465" offset="4021812">It is certainly true that more ideological organizations such as the national committee for an effective Congress or the conservative victory fund will continue to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.312" offset="4061205">They will, however, be limited by the $5,000.00 limit and will be less able to proliferate the number of six months committees in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.236" offset="4100911">Organized interest groups, at least those with a geographic basis, which can organize horizontally are able to proliferate committees and that is why it seems to us that is very clear that the practice of this industry which have been heavily relied upon in the Court below can continue to occur under the statute, since they can organize their political committees on a county basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.231" offset="4200908">Contrary to the rhetoric which accompany passage of the FECA, the statute in particular favors the use of corporate and union money for political activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.884" offset="4235494">Both are permitted to spend statutorily unlimited sums to raise money for so called segregated funds to finance six-month political committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.141" offset="4268513">Union or corporate money is thus spent to raise money and that money is distributed without reference to the wishes to the donors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.986" offset="4299860">In effect to some extent, the FECA reformed the problem of legal corporate contributions when making them less necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.225" offset="4324833">Sisson speculation, since the enactment of the statute, there has been very sharp increase in the number of corporate political action committees with no visible increase in illogically oriented groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.915" offset="4363598">I should say that the change statute made was to include corporations with government contracts in their provisions permitting corporations to setup segregated funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.538" offset="4410096">Six, whatever facial neutrality the statute may have, it is only skin deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.175" offset="4444682">In its operation it inevitably works great discrimination among various candidates and various causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.434" offset="4473731">Candidates and political movements never began from positions of equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.796" offset="4491180">Some who are initially disadvantaged moreover can overcome this disadvantage only by heavy spending, no matter how much the opponent spends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.273" offset="4525035">Differences in name recognition, disadvantages on the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.195" offset="4536738">The record indicates, for example, in 1972 that Attorney General Kelly may well have been able to raise, wage a stronger race against Senator Griffin, had he been able to obtain a level of campaign spending, enabling him to focus the voters attention more on economic issues in which he was thought to be strong, rather than on the raging busing controversy where he was thought to be weak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.117" offset="4628376">In that kind of situation the busing was a controversial issue, independent of any activities of Senator Griffin could be overcome only by a vigorous campaign by Senator Kelly, no matter how many resources were available to Senator Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.352" offset="4697339">Appellees believe these propositions are common sense propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.678" offset="4718655">We do not think there is speculation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.876" offset="4727432">Indeed, they are now the law of the FECA, according to a ruling of Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.167" offset="4760660">In an advisory ruling, involving Senator Benson, the Commission explicitly relied on the fact that an incumbent's exposure is the equivalent of substantial campaign expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.320" offset="4801202">Senator Benson has announced that he intends to run in both the Texas Presidential and Senatorial primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.486" offset="4821891">The Commission, fearful that his combined expenditures will influence each of these simultaneous campaigns, ruled that Senator Benson may only spend the amount permissible for the Senate primary, all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.848" offset="4867344">His major anticipated adversary in the Presidential primary, Governor Wallas was less free to out spend him two to one since Presidential Primary Candidates can spend twice the Senate limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.016" offset="4911961">In handing down this ruling, the Commission said “within Texas, the reduced Presidential Primary expenditure limitation applicable to Senator Benson are compensated for by the fact that he is already the Senator from Texas and thus within Texas begins with the significant exposure advantage over his rivals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.888" offset="5435455">They are also relevant I might say to show the kind of deep intrusion the statute makes in that the Commission will be asked time and again to address the question, how much will this candidate be able to speak in election and how much will another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.304" offset="5493133">I am not sure, I am being responsive Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.863" offset="5515389">I think that similar disadvantages are visited upon challengers by the limits on contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.243" offset="5552901">Incumbents are as we described in our papers, large advantages in raising contributions under the statute because of mailing list they develop from the Frank and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.329" offset="5593234">Indeed, although one might have anticipated that fundraising would be more difficult, the figures show that by September 30th of this year, incumbent Senators up the next time have already raised over $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.896" offset="5655510">At a corresponding time in 1974, they have raised less than a million-and-a-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.285" offset="5673064">So, they are not having any trouble raising it because they have all of this time to raise it which challengers do not and time is critical when you are raising small contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.779" offset="5711099">There is one argument; well, the argument that the statute helps challengers because offsets the superior fund raising ability of incumbents seems to us to be an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.167" offset="5752581">The greatest differential in funds is in those races in which the challengers simply as little or no plausible chance of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.590" offset="5782256">The limits in those circumstances have little impact because the outcome is certain and because spending is often less than the limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.611" offset="5814439">The impact in those races which are competitive, however, will be drastic, but those races are the very races in which the differential in funds is leased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.992" offset="5847876">In 1974, in the House, if you take all the races in which the challenger did raise 70,000 or more, the amount raised by all such challengers in fact substantially exceeded the amounts raised by the incumbents is they faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.021" offset="5903987">The limits already have an effect on those races where equality is greatest at the present moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.332" offset="7789296">Yes, I think it is impermissible for Congress to attempt to bring about these remedies by lowering the level of political communication when disclosure is available and when other remedies are also available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.257" offset="7844989">Remedy such as prohibitions on large late contributions which is certainly a viable remedy, it responds to everything that was cited in support of the FECA and it is not in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.642" offset="7898488">I think that, while Congress in deciding to have disclosure, has considerable discretion in determining what kind of disclosure and when, but I do not think that they can really try, that they can remedy this by stopping essentially political speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.968" offset="7983856">Certainly limits on candidates expenditures, Justice Rehnquist cannot be justified by any theory that the FECA, any evil the FECA claims the remedy, certainly limits on independent expenditure, it seems to me cannot be justified that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.491" offset="8057940">The problem has to be, if there is a problem in equality argument and in the argument that the candidates, once they assumed office, will be overly beholden and obligated to certain contributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.421" offset="8105587">In the case of the equality argument I think it is demonstrated in the record that you cannot bring about equality without producing more inequality, either that or silence itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.401" offset="8153548">That the challengers, people are challenging the status quo, rely heavily on money and you have to freeze them out in the name of equality and that is wrongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.721" offset="8182805">Second, equality is an impermissible goal in any event because the danger sought to be remedied when you try to reduce equality, inequality in political voice, the dangers stems from the communicative nature of the act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.091" offset="8248320">It is not like O'Brien where you had a congressional purpose unrelated to free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.746" offset="8270890">It is like Tucker and other cases where the danger was perceived in communicative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.338" offset="8297326">So, it seems, as for the obligation of candidates, I think candidates are obligated to their voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.514" offset="8321985">They want votes, they do not want money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.128" offset="8332434">They need money to communicate with the voters and I think their ultimate obligation is to them and I think if there was effective disclosure, they will not become overly burdened with obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.279" offset="8373081">I might also say, if you speculate for a moment about when obligations are most likely to be created, it would not be in the case of safe seats, it is only in the case of close or highly competitive seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.413" offset="8425639">That is where people do need money to run effective campaigns, but those are also cases in which the person has to be the most fearful of what the voters thinks has to be the most sensitive to voters' wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.972" offset="8475794">When you are dealing with safe seats, large contributions do create real dangers, but the remedy for that is to be sure that the candidate receiving the contributions, makes expenditures only for voter persuasion and is not permitted as the present statute does -- permits him, to use campaign funds for a variety of non-speech purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.898" offset="8579553">By regulating expenditures you can solve the obligation problem in safe seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.127" offset="8616438">Now, virtually a large numbers of the large contributions or improper contributions described in the appendix were made well before April 7th or after the election.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.951" offset="8747781">It seems to me in The New York Times against.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.454" offset="8753737">Sullivan, Tornillo, Mills, O’Brien, Red Lion and Letter Carriers are not inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.509" offset="8789995">The principle of non-interference in political communication in every case is consistent with the outcome in those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.275" offset="8824999">It seems to me that this statute, there is no way, that this statute can be viewed other than as an attempt to regulate political communication, indeed to regulate the content of political communication by intricate web of statutory and administrative rulings which redirect and re-channel political speech as well as limit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.005" offset="8911935">The greatest campaign reform law ever enacted was the First Amendment, relying the proposition that good speech will drive out bad and all appellants ask is, the Court enforce that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.662" offset="11798570">If the purpose is not just promiscuous to find out whether your neighbor gives 125 bucks to the local congressional candidate, there is a presumption that is one's politics are one's own business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.986" offset="11847889">That is why when the purpose is in terms of the prevention of corruption then this Court and the Congress must ask whether the disclosure levels are drawn to meet that purpose, that is what we are saying.</text>

            <text syncTime="3016.578" offset="12066273">I mean, they are cost of living adjustments in the statute, but again, I think that the major point we are trying to make is that this Court has to require the Congress to think about these problems, to think about these line drawn problems, both in terms of the threshold of reporting, the $10.00 record keeping and the $100.00 from the reporting end in terms of the application to minor parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.011" offset="12188003">Finally, let me just turn for a moment to Section 434 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.610" offset="12210364">As I indicated in response to questions, that Section requires that any private citizen has nothing to do with the Candidate, Political Committees, not making contribution to a candidate or political committee wants to get involved in political activity, wants to condemn his local congressman and run off some leaflets and spend more than $100.00 doing it, that person has to register with the Federal Election Commission and supply the reports required of political committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.506" offset="12317989">We think that provision is virtually impossible to justify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.130" offset="12336483">It seems to us that it is flatly in contravention of the principles in the Talley case where this Court protected the right of political speech and unanimity and we think it is also in conflict with the principles of the Thomas case where this Court rejected the application of just a mere registration requirement upon giving a speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.073" offset="12428225">Section 434 (e) runs afoul of both of those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.119" offset="12448392">And let me finally if I might, in terms of the discrimination against small and minor parties that this disclosure statute involves, it has been our contention that Congress simply failed to consider what alternatives were available to deal with the valid interest served by disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.518" offset="12550060">The same Act which did draw a sharp and unconstitutional distinctions when it came to dispersing the benefit of public financing, for example, to know such distinctions in imposing the burdens on association entailed in reporting and disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.884" offset="12607530">Instead, Congress indiscriminately cast a net across the entire range of political association, that is manifest by contributions to a party without regard to the very widely varying interest at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.940" offset="12659670">Analytically this Court found such an approach insufficient in Robell and the other communist membership cases and we would submit that it should find that approach insufficient here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.838" offset="12939285">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.937" offset="12951719">As has been indicated, I will begin by outlining the problems that Congress was dealing within this statute and then rather briefly showing how the particular solution selected accomplished those objectives and then I will discuss in some detail, the reporting in disclosure provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.253" offset="13024967">Mr. Cox will then follow and discuss the contribution and expenditures limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.304" offset="13049208">Since early in this century, there has been, in the language of this Court in the Autoworkers case, a long series of congressional efforts calculated to avoid the deleterious influences on Federal Elections, resulting from use of money by those who exercise control over large aggregations of capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.414" offset="13137607">Congress first faced this problem back in 1907 by enacting a statute prohibiting certain contributions by corporations in connection with elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.560" offset="13186194">In the Autoworkers case, this Court traced it at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.605" offset="13202390">The history of the congressional regulation of this problem what it described as series of acts to protect the political process from what Congress deemed to be the corroding effect of money, employed in elections by aggregated power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.703" offset="13266756">Unfortunately however, as these statutes were enacted, they proved to have so many loopholes that they were virtually ineffective in doing anything about the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.138" offset="13312522">And beginning in 1960’s, in the late 1960’s, Congress held a series of detailed hearings, exploring all aspects of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.686" offset="13350661">These culminated in a 1971 Act, the initial Federal Elections Campaign Act and was followed by the present amendment in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.184" offset="13396637">Now, this statute therefore, is not something that came out of the blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.883" offset="13411474">It represents the result of many, many years of study, three quarters of a century by the Congress, the body that is particularly expert in knowing the problems, resulting from the use of money, the corrupting effect of money on Federal Elections and Congress has studied the problem, has recognized that when things do not work, changes are necessary and Congress has been willing to change in this area and to try the devise a scheme that will once and for all, we hope put an end to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.825" offset="13543236">The present statute of course is a direct out growth of the disclosures of the 1972 campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.857" offset="13575419">There is no need to go into any detail with that sorry and sordid story.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.387" offset="13593496">It is set out in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.726" offset="13598824">It is a matter of public knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.301" offset="13605198">The huge campaign contributions, the gifts for people who wanted to be ambassadors, the campaign, specific large contributions in connection with anticipated favorable Government actions such as the milk producers, a large number of corporate officials who were convicted and many whom pleaded guilty to illegal campaign contributions and the evidence that developed of the vast increase in the cost of campaigns in this Country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.561" offset="13742184">Three quarters of the century of study of this problem by the Congress, you suggested that was sustained study or sporadic study?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="3445.295" offset="13781159">I would say Mr. Chief Justice, it was sporadic in the sense that Congress was not constantly looking at the problem, but over a number of times, there are a large numbers of statutes over the years in 1900, starting in 1907 and 1910, in the middle of the second decade, the Corrupt Practices Act of 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.442" offset="13865691">Gradually over the years, Congress realized that what it had done up to then was not enough to solve the problem and looked at the situation and devised what appeared to be more and more comprehensive regulatory things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.328" offset="13933296">It expanded the type of controls that extended during war, the prohibition on gifts from corporations to unions, as problems developed Congress studied them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.442" offset="13973734">But my point is that over a long period of time, Congress has considered these problems, studied them and devised schemes to deal with what it perceived to be an increasingly serious evil in the body politic, the corruption of Federal Elections by the use of money and the cost of these campaigns has risen at the staggering rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.853" offset="14071327">It is really the staggering rate and at page 35 of Mr. Cox’s brief, there is a chart which shows the increase in campaign cost reflected to show increases in a consumer price index.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.220" offset="14136842">And what it shows is over a 20-year period, from 1952, the 1972, after adjustments to reflect increases in the cost of living, the cost of congressional races increased more than 300% and over the 10-year period, 1962 to 1972, the cost of Presidential races with the similar adjustment increased more than 450%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.870" offset="14239451">And by 1972, it was estimated that the total cost of elections in this Country exceeded approximately $400 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.328" offset="14281247">Now, what is the consequence of this escalating cost?</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.524" offset="14298070">It is a vicious circle because when one candidate sees another candidate spending more and more, he feels impelled to spend more and more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.738" offset="14334851">As the cost of these campaigns increase, the candidates naturally turn to where the money is, the easiest source of money, those are the wealthy interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.635" offset="14374452">Once a wealthy interest gives a campaign contribution, his competitors, other businessmen also feel obliged to give because they are concerned that if they do not give, either they will be discriminated against by Government officials or their competitors will gain an advantage as result for these contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.624" offset="14450416">And thus, the candidates as result of this thing feel more and more obligated to the sources, the large sources of campaign contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.870" offset="14487406">And it is not surprising with this history, that by the early 1970’s, there was a tremendous feeling in this country that you could not trust the Government, a lack of electric confidence in our Government Officials, the notion that somehow people could be bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.486" offset="14565878">If you gave enough money, people could be bought and conversely correspondingly really, the average man who was not very affluent, who did have access to all these sources, he believed that it was rather feel for him to try to play an active role in the campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.198" offset="14632751">For one thing if you want to run through office, he knew he could not raise these sources money and secondly if he wanted to try --</text>

            <text syncTime="4817.114" offset="19268441">First, this is a very useful method for enforcing the statute because and particularly where the overall limit is $1,000.00, a contribution of a hundred cannot said to be in substantial, but equally or perhaps more important is the problem of culminating of combining contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.915" offset="19351615">If you have a large number of people who are a affiliated, who do combine contributions again in this blue brief on page 174, an example is cited how a Senator on one day, in his senatorial campaign received 247 individual contributions totaling $28,000.00 from the employees of one single corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4968.996" offset="19875944">But our point is that the presence statute is a reasonable effort made by Congress to deal with this problem and that why we think there is a very little, if any, chilling effect to whatever extent there maybe some slide show we think that is more than off set by the very strong compelling Governmental interest in trying to protect the integrity of Federal Elections.</text>

            <text syncTime="5490.845" offset="21963337">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5495.075" offset="21980264">So I come late in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.545" offset="21994162">I cannot resist saying just a word in recognition of the importance and weight of the responsibility that rests upon this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.137" offset="22048496">Judging the constitutionality of the statute even when there are few are issues, less complicated issues and there are here, is always a solemn occasion, but here the issues are of even greater magnitude, indeed of a magnitude greater than any of those in any Federal Legislation I can think of in several decades, except perhaps the Civil Rights Acts of the 1960’s and certainly none go any closer to the heart of our Political and Governmental system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5550.030" offset="22200111">The attack I would emphasize, is leveled not only at the conclusions of the Congress and the President of the United States, but in substance it is leveled at the conclusions of a majority of the state legislatures and we must take it that much of this represents the conclusions of their people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5570.324" offset="22281195">There are 44 States that have disclosure statutes in one form or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.931" offset="22303660">There are 37 States that put limits on expenditures, many of them going back a number of decades and there 10 States that have been adopted public financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5588.318" offset="22353189">So, that in addition to the weight of the judgment of the Congress and the President to sign the legislation, there is this added problem of the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.074" offset="22400209">Now of course if it is the court's responsibility the whole the Act unconstitutional, it will do it as this Court always has, but I submit that those are considerations that should be weighed in the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.390" offset="22461544">My argument is directed to the proposition that ceilings upon contributions and expenditures are consistent with the First and Fifth Amendments both as a back did on the face of the statute and as applied to any situation ripe for adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.825" offset="22539285">It is important at the outset to be clear about exactly what the ceilings on contributions and expenditures do and do not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5645.980" offset="22583902">The Act deals with conduct, the giving and spending of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.319" offset="22609189">The conduct is speech related, I acknowledge and indeed emphasize because money buys the facilities of best communications and leveraging the money available for political campaigns, available for spending may of course to some degree reduce the amount that is spent for mass communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.154" offset="22692571">But even so the conduct to speech related, I emphasize that it is conduct and not speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="5681.583" offset="22726322">The FECA does not prohibit, punish or attached liability to utterance, communication or publication except in the very limited sense that in the case of expenditures one may have to look at the publication to see whether it urges the election or defeat of candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5701.753" offset="22806988">So, it will be evidence as to purpose, but in no other sense --</text>

            <text syncTime="5710.501" offset="22841992">But there is no attempt under 608 (e) or anywhere else to censure directly or indirectly the ideas expressed or the verbal or pictorial form communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.609" offset="22894341">Equally apart, the public injuries at which the Act is directed are the consequences, not of speech, but of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5734.303" offset="22937182">Congress was not saying that there is too much speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="5737.641" offset="22950557">The dangerous thoughts were being expressed, that the wrong people were expressing or that they were expressing them in dangerous ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.467" offset="22985770">Congress was concerned with what we call the arms race political expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.993" offset="23007922">With the pressure to raise vast financial resources, the corrosive influence of obligations to big contributors upon the conduct of Government, with the laws of public confidence in the honor and integrity of Government when money spent plays too big a role.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.684" offset="23074691">And with the political inequalities resulting not from the volume of speech, but from the need to raise money and the indebtedness to those who provide big money and I think those two characteristics of the statute fix the applicable First Amendment principles, although I do not suggest for a moment that they render the First Amendment irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5794.728" offset="23178867">When the Governments attempts to deal with speech directly then a case for regulations has to be made wholly or in partly at least in terms of the danger, the danger of the consequences of the ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5810.618" offset="23242397">Mills in Alabama’s are very good example.</text>
            <text syncTime="5813.686" offset="23254727">The Alabama statute forbade last minute newspaper editorials on Election Day.</text>
            <text syncTime="5819.075" offset="23276251">The only conceivable justification was that the ideas expressed would have somehow have too much impact upon the public and it was quite right for the court to reply as it did in that case, no test of reasonableness can save such as state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.787" offset="23343125">The reason is that censorship concerned for the ideas expressed may suppress the information or criticism essential to Self Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.705" offset="23386802">It carries danger of discrimination among ideas or speakers and there is sometimes have been said, it carries the seeds of an official ideology.</text>
            <text syncTime="5855.629" offset="23422433">And, of course in such cases there is little or perhaps no room for balancing because the very purpose of the First Amendment as James Madison said “Is to withhold the censorial power from Government and retain it in the people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5873.108" offset="23492336">The cases that illustrate this proposition are the case of the Pentagon Papers, New York Times against Sullivan, Miami Herald against Tornillo and the Red Lion Broadcasting case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.939" offset="23543745">I want to make clear -- plain that we are not quarreling with those cases and we have no need to invoke any of them in our support.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.232" offset="23584914">Cases like the present which involves the regulation of speech related conduct because of the public injury done by the conduct, quite apart from the speech call for an entirely difference step.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.661" offset="23646563">Such a law carries few with any of peculiar risk of censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5917.224" offset="23668820">It does not suppress criticism, ideas or information.</text>

            <text syncTime="6861.064" offset="27444245">There is no question that the incumbents have advantages sometimes the disadvantages, but they are likely through name recognition to be advantages.</text>

            <text syncTime="6897.191" offset="27588754">I would add to that Mr. Chief Justice that the most that is contended, is that on the average as I understand it because the word generally is included in the heading in the brief that on the average they contend statistically somewhat more incumbents may benefit and challengers be hurt than the other way around.</text>
            <text syncTime="6921.796" offset="27687184">But one does not make a case of unconstitutional discrimination by that kind of statistical average.</text>
            <text syncTime="6931.971" offset="27727830">Furthermore, all it seems to me say is that challengers gain more from the pernicious practices and incumbents and we would say that the pernicious practices are the evils, Congress were meeting or was meeting are such that they justifies certainly any chance differentiation between them.</text>
