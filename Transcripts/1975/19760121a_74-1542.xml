            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103368">We will hear arguments first this morning in number 1542, Union Electric Company against the Environmental Protection Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.420" offset="137014">Mr. Ferrell, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Ferrell</label>
            <text syncTime="11.245" offset="148299">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.353" offset="176720">This case arose in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.259" offset="212351">It arose by a petition brought under the Judicial Review Section of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, to review the sulfur emission regulation in the Missouri Implementation Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.494" offset="309317">Section 307 (b) (1) says that petitions may be brought within two different time periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.236" offset="356233">In the first place, the petition may be brought within 30 days after the administrator of the EPA approves the implementation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.244" offset="412344">In that event, it is probable that there would be an administrative record which is susceptible of review by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.312" offset="476606">The Section secondly says that petitions may be brought at a later date if tMr. Justice Rehnquisthey arise solely on grounds that have occurred more than 30 days after the EPA approved the state devised implementation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.011" offset="587365">So far as we have been able to ascertain, this is the only case in the United States that has been brought more than 30 days after the EPA approved the implementation plan, and of course, brought on grounds that arose more than 30 days after such group.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.926" offset="703035">There were a substantial number of cases that have been filed within this initial 30-day period which in 99% of the cases occurred within the month of June 1972 and those cases have resulted in a apparently substantial number of opinions by the several United States Courts of Appeals and the various Circuits because this implementation plan review petitions must be brought in the appropriate Circuit, First to Tenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.050" offset="887564">The results have differed in those decisions and I think that it is the differing results that have occurred vis-à-vis themselves and the different result in many of those cases with the result reached by the Eighth Circuit in the instant case is now before Your Honors, there is the reason this case is here, that is the basis for us to grant of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.334" offset="1012638">Now, let us take a quick look at the allegations of the petitioner’s petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.177" offset="1059972">Union Electric alleges that three of its base load electric generating plants and base load plants are the one that supply the bulk of the electricity, three of them, all located in the State of Missouri in the Eighth Circuit do not meet the sulfur emission regulation in the state devised implementation plan, that by EPA approval has become a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.604" offset="1217752">We allege that grounds which of a reason more than 30 days after the EPA approval make it impossible for Union Electric on technical grounds to comply with this regulation and we allege that it would be manifestly against the public interest for Union Electric to make an attempt to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.380" offset="1364873">Now, going on a scientific possibility of compliance, I am not saying that it may work out, there are as far as we know and as far as we allege in the petition only two scientific basis of which a compliance could hope to be attempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.746" offset="1454317">One is by the utilization of what is called sulfur dioxide removal equipment, in the industry is commonly known as scrubbers and perhaps that is what we actually refer to it from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.929" offset="1527041">The other method would be the use of a low sulfur content coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.429" offset="1565076">It is ordinarily found in the Midwest and it is not too frequent these days.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.041" offset="1603528">We allege in our petition that in the time following the period 30 days after the administrator approved the EPA plan, I mean, the administrator of the EPA approve the implementation plan, thereby making it federal law that it has been demonstrated that no scrubbers have been developed or invented that would permit or enable a compliance with this sulfur emission regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.579" offset="1777608">So we demonstrate that it is technically impossible to comply with this federal law and we allege that those grounds have a reason more than 30 days following the EPA approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.725" offset="1842183">Now, it is true that a considerable number of years ago, utilities and suppliers began to work on what are called scrubbers, development, invent them, Union Electric was deeply engaged in this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.591" offset="1921699">There were high hopes, high expectations, but unhappily in light and in this case, the expectations have not been realized and this (Inaudible) in our complaint, one that we think that is susceptible of proof and I think should be taken by this Court in these deliberations as being a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.977" offset="2035175">Now, going to low sulfur coal I think even and I am not saying this in any derogatory manner, but my brethren of the Department of Justice, the respondent EPA would agree that there is unhappily is just not enough low sulfur coal at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.832" offset="2126604">And if we go on to the market and corner it, beat it up, up, up, we are going to run into electric rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.482" offset="2165265">Money has to come from somewhere and it comes from the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.008" offset="2191388">So we are going to have electric rate so high, that we corner the market on low sulfur coal that it would topple, virtually destroy the economy on the St. Louis area, much of Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.859" offset="2262754">So we contend that it would be manifestly against the public interest for us to attempt if we could to corner the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.577" offset="2301624">Now, turning a minute to scrubbers if I may, I am sure all of Your Honors are familiar with the fact, there has been a series of inflation in the world today, unhappily the price of these ineffective scrubbers, these inefficient scrubbers that will not enable us to comply have increased so enormously that to install them on our three electric generating plants would cost us over $500 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.511" offset="2457314">Assuming that we can go on to the market in New York and ask and get $500 million for non-productive equipment, we have terrible carrying charges as we allege, it is worth hundred million dollars per year, that would call for terrible increase on electric rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.113" offset="2539757">We do not allege the percentage, but it would be so high that we say it would be manifestly against the public interest and again it would be imposing upon our economy and economic condition there would be manifestly against the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.641" offset="2617915">I think there is one variant part of allegation in our complaint that has to be realized and considered in this entire case and that is our allegation that although Union Electric, the petitioner is not meeting the state sulfur emission standard in the federally approved implementation plan, it is fulfilling the national ambient air quality standards, both primarily and secondary and these national ambient air quality standards are really thrust the purpose of our Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.832" offset="2838597">I suppose that when you get down to precise question as you have to at some time or should in any lawsuit, perhaps make an existence precisely as possible to do, what do we mean by the word “grounds” in the judicial review section?</text>
            <text syncTime="704.137" offset="2919890">Well it is a word of general import; lawyers use it all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.378" offset="2956880">Judges use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.028" offset="2963463">I do not know if whether we always know exactly what we mean by it, but here I do not think we can take that word alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.704" offset="2994183">We have to look at to congressional history.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.359" offset="3008707">We have a somewhat ambiguous statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.551" offset="3021559">We have to look at the congressional history and there is one other thing that I want to point out and that is this Court is familiar with the rule that you should construe an Act of Congress to be constitutional or rather than unconstitutional for the reason of the concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.847" offset="3102748">So sometimes in the constructional process itself, we are confronted with constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.099" offset="3151753">Now, let me divert, if I may for just one second, there has been a kind of a thread that is running through this litigation and that is that where really you should not and maybe you do not intend to place a fact-finding original type jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals, for we claim that you have here, but the statute has, the Congressional Act has, maybe that is unfortunate, I suppose it is unfortunate the courts have more than they can do anyway, but it has been done here and the question is, what are the facts to be found?</text>
            <text syncTime="821.114" offset="3387796">We say that these technical and economic factors making it impossible for petitioners to comply with the regulation, although we are fulfilling the federal standard.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="840.390" offset="3464909">Are you suggesting Mr. Ferrell that none of these of factors could have been anticipated in time for a different type of review?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_ferrell" startTime="853.593" stopTime="949.323">
            <label>Mr. William H. Ferrell</label>
            <text syncTime="853.593" offset="3517677">Well, I do in my brief and I will now point out that we think from constitutional point of view, there are three different methods that the constitutional requirement should be met and when you talk about a different type of review in a sense you have to look at the two periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.202" offset="3624152">I hope I am not taking too long to answer your question, but when you have it in the Court of Appeals 30 days after the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has approved the plan then you do have some kind of a record before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.173" offset="3708057">But when you are alleging in your petition in the Court of Appeals grounds that arose long after the Federal Agency has acted, you do not have an administrator or administrative record or review with one possible exception which I refer to in my brief and I think it is a possible one, one that might be adapted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.669" offset="3845984">Maybe it is the best one, I do not know, we are unhappily dealing with a sort of ambiguous Act of Congress and presented with a very difficult problem, well, you do not want to throw it out completely as being too ambiguous.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="949.323" offset="3900632">But did not the Eighth Circuit say in effect that even if you had raised this within a 30-day period, they would not have listen to it?</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Ferrell</label>
            <text syncTime="957.082" offset="3931665">They did say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.841" offset="3938666">They did say that and I have been anticipating whether there would be a question as to whether the time period really makes a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.966" offset="3983179">Procedurally, I think it probably might.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.573" offset="4001569">In my initial brief, I skirted around it, in my reply brief and the adversary have sometimes, I have got a little more definitely to it, but I am not at all assured.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.114" offset="4055799">I mean, I am rather inclined to think that technical and economic factors must be considered at any time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.635" offset="4105850">Yes, but I thought Judge Gibson's opinion said you cannot consider that until you bring in an employee?</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.960" offset="4235208">That to me brings in sort of a constitutional feeling I have, but here we have something that the person can lose his business for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.837" offset="4354640">I question whether that is a very clear interpretation from the statute that it should be raised in enforcement proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.769" offset="4406362">No, in fact I say that if you rule as has I think the Seventh Circuit in the Indiana in Michigan Electric Company case, former Justice of this Court was ahead of the time there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.735" offset="4470206">Mr. Justice Clark, I think it s a Buckeye case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.674" offset="4494029">I think that is a Sixth Circuit that held that the constitutional difficulty is same and I would agree with him if the point may be raised in enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.961" offset="4551185">Now, of course, the statute itself says that you may not raise anything in an enforcement proceeding, there is a preclusionary provision, if it may be raised in a judicial review proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.328" offset="4652645">Maybe -- may I mention just one practical matter?</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.759" offset="4666333">Maybe it is not a legal matter, but the utility industry is engaged in a very large capital raising campaign and it maybe true that it will come about, but you hate to go to the Wall Street when you right sitting in an enforcement proceeding that may close down all of your plants or require to pay as much as a $50,000.00 a day in fine per plant to keep them open which would mean you could not get the working capital to go on and you kind of hate to go on and try to raise money to build new plants and we must build new plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.146" offset="4843861">In fact, new plants must be built just to stay on even line. Everybody has --</text>

            <text syncTime="1197.001" offset="4891299">I suppose that people in Missouri would be unhappy if you had to close up the utility and not serve the community anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.088" offset="4919616">Is it that your reaction they are not proceeding in that area, that arena because they ruled against you on the merits whereas there is no procedure in Missouri at all in which you can raise any of these questions?</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Ferrell</label>
            <text syncTime="1216.216" offset="4968204">Well, the variance procedure this Court did, I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist was the author of the opinion, decided one and only one case under the Clean Air Act and that is a variance approved by the state under the state law may thereafter be consider a revision of an implementation plan and approved by the Environmental Protection Agency under to be precise I think it is 101 or 110 (c) of the Clean Air Act, if there will not be any jeopardy to the maintenance of the National Air Quality Standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.084" offset="5183662">But at least in Missouri and I will not go down Missouri, there is one difficulty about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.805" offset="5210516">The statute that governs the EPA’s approval of a variance, a revision section 101 (c) says there must be a public hearing and the Missouri statute that provides for variances and I think others too as well as Missouri, say that a variance may be granted without a hearing and at least 90% of them are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.599" offset="5341755">The executive secretary, I do not like to say percentages, I do not really know or many of them are, the executive secretary proves the grant of the variance to the Air Act Conservation permission as granted without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.545" offset="5421481">So, at least in Missouri we cannot have EPA approved variances unless there is a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.843" offset="5462650">Now, if there is a hearing, the EPA still proceeds with the enforcement of the Federal Law, you see we have separate verification, we have a state law, we have a federal law, I mean, that does not really have any particular concern on what state is doing, the state can have a proceeding that goes on for four or five six years --</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.307" offset="6352589">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.094" offset="6367740">I think the question has been well presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.248" offset="6380279">Primarily we are concerned with whether or not in approval of the State Air Implementation Plan, the EPA must consider the economic and technological feasibility of the plan before approving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.548" offset="6445481">The Court below said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.606" offset="6453735">They said no at anytime as a matter of law whether 30 days, within 30 days or after.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.174" offset="6484037">We agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.614" offset="6489784">We believe that from the face of the statute that is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.062" offset="6503577">We believe from the history of it is clear and also from its structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.248" offset="6524266">If there is one thing that is clear on pollution control law when you go to Congress, it is technology and economics and the Water Pollution Control Act, it is a Technology Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.773" offset="6574421">Under section 301, they refer to for 77 to the best practicable control technology available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.794" offset="6618516">For 83, they refer to the best available technology, economically achievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.709" offset="6646101">In the Clean Air Act, it comes up again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.015" offset="6659371">It comes up with respect to technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.167" offset="6667939">It is relevant to Air Craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.916" offset="6679015">It is relevant to fuels, to motor vehicles, to new source performance standards and Section 110 itself twice brings technology into play, in Section 110 (e) and Section 110 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.061" offset="6743590">So that I think that when the standards are set forth in Section 110 (a) (2) as to what the EPA shall review when it reviews a plan, it sets eight of them out and when it chooses to omit technology and economics, I think it is very clear that that choice by Congress was clear and intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.277" offset="6832406">In fact, when you go to the history of the Act, it is even more clear, set forth well in the Court of Appeals, set forth well in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.721" offset="6866157">The Act adapted the Senate language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.723" offset="6882248">The reports, the floor debates, statements after the fact all make very, very clear that as far as Congress was concerned, the primary Air Quality Standards were to be met where the plants were to close or they were to return and get an extension from Congress itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.039" offset="11943420">Assuming that what you have put forward is going to the market for 500 million is a legitimate ground under some standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.143" offset="11983858">Assuming that I would suggest that really what they did was they had an order of violation from the EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.595" offset="12021683">Rather than go through the 113 procedure of a conference of going through the various grounds that the EPA must incorporate into its order of compliance, it chose to go to the Court of Appeals and I think there is a good reason why they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.791" offset="12090437">They did that because if they can win the Court of Appeals, if those things can be heard in the Court of Appeals under 307, they have avoided the plan and they start the procedure all over again back at the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.472" offset="12141219">If you look at what the Third Circuit did in Duquesne, they have been back and forth the EPA four times in the original plan on economic and technological grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.048" offset="12187508">The Court of Appeals could not keep up with the change in technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.285" offset="12208406">Our argument last March, they were still submitting new studies on technology to the Court of Appeals and all they were getting to was avoiding the plan which would require going back to the state, back to the EPA, back to the Court of Appeals and then finally only at that time could you get an enforcement started again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.130" offset="12283848">And when you have two years, in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for the case to be heard, you are talking about the fact that if they can win by this route, we cannot get back to enforcement, to a compliance schedule for perhaps up to three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.410" offset="12344975">In fact, if you go through compliance hearing in order to enforce and a case to enforce by the EPA which the state could moot it anytime by revising the plan provided they still come under the primary air quality standards, they could revise the plan along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.014" offset="12419371">But assuming that you get to an enforcement proceeding, assuming they have an equitable ground that must be heard, like going to the market, like they cannot close down all the plants, assuming they have such a ground, the Court at that point can fashion an order after full adjudicatory type hearing, could fashion an order which will make the Clean Air Act as effective as it can immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.297" offset="12524488">Then you go up to the Court of Appeals on review at that time and they review the record before the Trial Court which must have findings of fact in conclusion to go and the decree is in effect at that point unless the Court of Appeals were to stay it, if new technology comes up, if a new report comes up, you go back under Rule 60 (b) under Federal Rules and you re-open at the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.547" offset="12625530">You do not submit technology reports to the Court of Appeals on oral argument as was done in Duquesne.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.003" offset="12651339">The fact is the one should get into economics and to technology, inevitably is not a broad standard you are concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.231" offset="12696269">You get down how it affects one plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.820" offset="12710584">All the plan does is set an emission standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.630" offset="12725840">How the plant complies is up to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.552" offset="12737543">It may be, if it has an old plant, it cannot use a particular kind of technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.933" offset="12755097">It may be if it is financial structure is weak it cannot get to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.706" offset="12774114">Maybe if it is financial structure is strong it could, but as Duquesne indicates, you are getting to the point where to consider these you have to consider it case by case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.381" offset="12820821">And if you are going to consider it case by case, enforcement is the only way you can because at that point you call witnesses, you have your experts on the stand, they are under cross-examination at that time and that is the way that this kind of issue must be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.814" offset="12886545">So that I think that enforcement is the stage where if they have a ground then that is where it must be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.643" offset="12913921">It may be equitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.185" offset="12920086">It may be -- I just do not know what they will be, but that will be fashioned as you go, but to have it heard on the Court of Appeals is impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.488" offset="12957285">I think if the Court would look at the State of Texas, the EPA, which had to do with t the Texas Plan where the EPA changed the plan because they did not think the model use on oxides would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.991" offset="13007231">And the Court of Appeals at that point had to go through a diffusion model on oxide as it applies not just to electric utilities, but to all the various kinds of sources to put oxides out, including automobiles and every kind of plant that uses heat of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.477" offset="13085180">And if you see there, I believe it was Mr. Justice Cork in concurring said that this is no way to review this kind of matter as to technical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.941" offset="13131051">They did not have findings of fact to conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.186" offset="13144112">In fact, after it was argued, they had hold hearings informally with the parties from both sides and in fact with experts so that for the benefit of the Court, the expert could take them through the diffusion model used by the state and the one use by the EPA and I think if you look at that and that is just the overall model used, that did not even get into the question whether or not it was feasible as to particular plants and sources.</text>

            <text syncTime="3582.612" offset="14433726">I would refer to our briefs on that, but I want to make one unique point that arises for the first time I think in American juridical history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.486" offset="14481268">And that is that we have here the very anomalous situation where a state can place an emission and an emission limitation in a plant that exceeds the national air quality standards and that by EPA approval of that plan, it becomes Federal Law whereas the Federal Government itself, if it made an implementation plan could not place an emission limitation that exceeds the national air quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.110" offset="14679799">That is due, I think to a clear misreading of Section 116, both as to congressional history and as to the Section itself.</text>
