            <label>Mr. Alphonso H. Voorhees</label>
            <text syncTime="12.918" offset="154988">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.996" offset="167318">My name is Voorhees, I am from Saint Luis Missouri, and I represent Transamerican Freight Lines, the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.304" offset="200546">The case is hereby a writ of certiorari to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.764" offset="222384">The facts of this case involved a lease of equipment between two trucking companies, two certificated carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.324" offset="268568">They start on January 19, 1968 at which time the lesser the owner of the equipment, a tractor and trailer leased the equipment to Transamerican Freight Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.685" offset="334083">The lesser was Brada Miller Freight Systems, the respondent here leased the equipment to Transamerican Freight Lines to carry a load of steel from Detroit, Michigan, at which point the lease was entered into to Kansas City, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.060" offset="403569">During the progress of the lease and the carriage of the steel, the truck was involved in an accident in Illinois and injuring one Sandra Wear seriously, and she later filed suit against both Brada Miller and Transamerican.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.310" offset="492594">Prior to trial Sandra Wear, dismissed her case against Brada Miller and proceeded to trial against Transamerican Freight Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.422" offset="524986">During the course of which trial, Transamerican entered into a settlement with Sandra Wear.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.662" offset="549959">The lease agreement between the parties leasing the equipment, provided for the lease of the equipment and provided that the lesser, Brada Miller, would furnish a driver, one Hardrick, who would operate the equipment during the term do the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.391" offset="664898">The lease also contained an indemnity agreement providing that in the event of a loss, the lesser Brada Miller, would hold the lessee Transamerican, harmless from any loss, which resulted from the negligence of the lesser, or its agents, or servants.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.231" offset="752252">The lease provided that the driver was to be considered an employee and agent of the lesser during the terms of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.257" offset="792376">The Interstate Commerce Commission has handed down regulations, some twenty years ago, governing the relationship of parties involving in the leasing or the transfer of equipment from one person or company to another for a trip, which is what we call this, in other words the equipment was leased for one trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.152" offset="935945">And the regulations of the Commission set forth certain requirements which must be met by the parties to the lease in this kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.230" offset="988190">Applying to our case, one of the regulations states, and I am quoting out of the middle of Section 1057 3(a) of the regulations, that the two carriers involved in the lease must have first agreed in writing that control and responsibility for the operation of the equipment shall be that of the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.315" offset="1124549">This case was argued and decided by the Seventh Circuit and that Court held that the indemnity agreement involved here violated the control and responsibility provisions of the Commerce Commissions Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.787" offset="1218485">The purpose of this lawsuit is a suit by Transamerican the lessee, against Brada the lesser, to recover the amount which Transamerican had paid Sandra Wear to settle the lawsuit plus the expenses involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.990" offset="1295285">As I say the narrow issue is now whether or not the indemnity provision in the lease agreement violates the control and responsibility provisions of the Regulations of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.468" offset="1401238">The Seventh Circuit among the Circuits, among the Circuit Court of Appeals, stands alone in holding that the indemnity provisions are in violation of these Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.158" offset="1467902">And on the other side, and holding directly opposite, are decisions of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Circuits and by implication a decision of the Tenth Circuit, all of which cases are cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.912" offset="1542926">The question the Commission has in the past resided that when they talk about control and responsibility, and I will quote, possibly subject to some qualifications it may be stated that when a certificate are permit holder; Furnishes service in vehicles owned and operated by others, he must control the service to the same extent as if he owned the vehicles, but need to control the vehicles only to the extent necessary to be responsible to the shipper, the public and the Commission for the Transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.254" offset="1716379">This lease provided and was complied within this respect that the equipment during the term of the lease was identified as that of the lessee, the signs, decals, whatever you want to call them of the Transamerican Freight Lines were placed on the truck and were on the truck at the time of the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.277" offset="1808434">The truck was required to and was following the certificate of the routes of the Transamerican Freight Lines, and Transamerican in carrying out its responsibility, which is provided for by the lease and the regulations has ultimately paid the injured party in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.453" offset="1913133">As I have quoted from comments of the Commission in the prior hearings, the—it is not necessary, it is not the dealing of the Commission that the lessee has to control the direct minute-to-minute, day-to-day operation of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.602" offset="2013757">The lessee must control the service, that is the routes, the identity of the equipment, other things which are provided for in the regulations, but as far as the actual operation of the vehicle itself, the lessee is permitted to allow this equipment or direct that it be in effect operated by others as long as it, the lessee, is responsible for the operations.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="518.674" offset="2178015">Does the agreement provide that the lessee has the right to reject the driver furnished by the lesser?</text>
            <text syncTime="529.395" offset="2220856">Will it go that far?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alphonso_h_voorhees" startTime="530.809" stopTime="589.609">
            <label>Mr. Alphonso H. Voorhees</label>
            <text syncTime="530.809" offset="2226603">The agreement does not specifically provide that, in fact the agreement in this case, which is contained in the appendix to the petitioner’s brief, provides that the person operating the truck shall be Howard Hardrick, the employee of Brada Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.431" offset="2325032">It does not—now by implication, or I guess by actual words, by making that provision the lessee has at least accepted Howard Hardrick as a driver of the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.528" offset="2385427">Hardrick was an employee of the lesser Brada, prior to the time of the lease, he was an employee of Brada after the lease and, by the terms of the lease was an employee of Brada the lesser at the time of the lease.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.609" offset="2461705">As I understand it, the indemnification clause here does not apply to the lessee’s own negligence.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="597.597" offset="2493679">Do you think the case would be different if it did?</text>

            <label>Mr. Alphonso H. Voorhees</label>
            <text syncTime="602.197" offset="2512069">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.343" offset="2524712">I think if we read the amici curiae brief filed by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the United States, they are discussing the fact that ultimately they may enact regulations regulating the area of indemnity agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.389" offset="2608826">Their briefs states quite clearly that they do not feel that their present regulations do control these agreements, and they state that when they do enact such regulations they would consider allowing indemnity agreements in certain instances and not allowing them in other instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.526" offset="2713421">But at this point the position is that no regulations have been made controlling the indemnity agreement, prohibiting them or allowing them, they did not just mention therefore the indemnity agreement we contend is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.404" offset="2780921">Now, your question is directed to if it was the negligence of the lessee, and I think if we read the amici curiae brief, their feeling is that when they enact regulations they would probably provide that negligence of the lessee would preclude its recovery under an indemnity agreement, but this has not been regulated at this time?</text>

            <text syncTime="937.531" offset="3853404">Now, to track back a little bit on this history the Commission may enacted these Regulations and one of the principle things that they were concerned about was lessee’s dodging liability I think, so they said that the lessee should be responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.000" offset="3927279">And then I say this, all of the requirements of the Regulations of the Commission have been carried out in this case, they have been followed by the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.412" offset="4548993">I find in defining the word control of an employee to involve some rather nebulous phrases and sometimes beyond those fictitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.626" offset="4597790">An employer is not going to control the minute-to-minute operations of a driver driving a truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.103" offset="4627778">He is not going to be able to prevent him from going too fast or from failing to stop at an appropriate time, he is going to—the control involved here is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.521" offset="4689427">The lessee controls in that he tells the driver where to go and what routes to follow and what reports to file and prepare, the lesser controls because the lesser is the continuing employer, the lesser is the one that the man is going to be working for next week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.700" offset="4790155">Chances are the lessee would not see this driver again after the end of this particular trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.963" offset="4807187">So that the lesser is then the one that has the right to discipline the employee if he has violated traffic regulations, or has done something wrong and the lesser is the one that could discharge him, or provide some other type of discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.003" offset="4891301">Now, there are two, aside from the fact that we have the authority of several Circuits maintaining that these indemnity agreements are not in violation of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.221" offset="4964235">Two basic reasons here, which I urge are first the basic concept of freedom of contract;</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.724" offset="5006240">I have quoted in the brief from a case that is quite old from this Court, a 1900 case, and it is Baltimore and Ohio, Southwestern Railway Company versus White, provides that the contract between parties should not be invalidated unless it is clearly against public policy, public right or public welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.740" offset="5146257">Additionally, the courts have held and this Court in the case of Bowles against Seminole Rock and Sand Company, that the interpretations by an administrative agency of the government of its own regulations are entitled to great weight(ph) and they become controlling, and this is a quote from the Bowles case, “become of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.421" offset="5297035">The amici brief, filed in this case by the Commission and by the United States, takes the strong position that they have not attempted to regulate indemnity agreements that they feel that the indemnity agreement in this case is appropriate and is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.884" offset="5390867">And that they do discuss the fact that in the future they may attempt to regulate these agreements, I think you can assume from reading their brief that they probably will but they have not at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.634" offset="5453874">I think that basically that concludes my argument unless the Court has any further questions?</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.004" offset="5527331">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.505" offset="5541332">The respondent in this case takes a somewhat different view of the various liabilities and the right of control and the fact of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.456" offset="5589189">The questions presented by the petitioner, the respondent and the ICC and the United States, and I will refer to it as the ICC for simplicity, are a little bit different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.029" offset="5639448">The petitioner states that the question before the Court is where the lessee assumes control and responsibility for the tractor and trailer is an indemnity caused in an otherwise vital least agreement against the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.807" offset="5698590">The respondent sees the question as whether an agreement to indemnify for losses, due to the operation of the equipment, is in violation of the regulations and the ICC sees the question as whether the agreement to indemnify for loses—whether the regulation for prohibits the lesser from agreeing to indemnify the lessee for losses caused by the negligence of the lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.277" offset="5808408">Now in the amici curiae brief, the Interstate Commerce Commission claims that indemnity agreements, such as we have here, are beneficial because they tend to place the responsibility for the loss, for the casualty, where it belongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.581" offset="5881656">The ICC assumes that the negligence of the driver is the negligence of the lesser, and it is respondent’s position in this case that the ICC is incorrect in that for reasons I hope to develop in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.929" offset="5942991">The regulations require that the exclusive possession control and use of the equipment remain in the lessee, and of course not in the lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.901" offset="5986877">Now, in the ICC brief, the Interstate Commerce Commission takes the position that the regulations do not require the lessee to operate the equipment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.786" offset="6050511">The lesser can perform that task by furnishing the driver as well as the equipment, and that subject to authority and responsibili—responsibility of the regulations, it can allow the lesser to perform the ministerial tasks of moving the freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.175" offset="6123968">In other words, it is the Interstate Commerce Commission’s position and the petitioner’s commission that the actual movement of the freight, the actual work is done by the lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.182" offset="6176003">On page eight of the brief states that the mere performance by the lesser of physical operation of leased equipment does not negate the lessee’s control and responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.049" offset="6219471">And further on page nine, under certain circumstances, an indemnity cause might help to induce the lesser properly to perform the ministerial tasks that under the regulations can be assigned to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.806" offset="6274537">The indemnity cause might help the lessee influence performance of the lesser and thereby exercise control and responsibility over the lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.085" offset="6307661">And finally on page sixteen, the amici curiae brief states that providing the driver at least physical moment-to-moment control of the vehicle and the lesser, this is the control over ministerial tasks and the ICC states is it not the control and responsibility required by the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.045" offset="6391461">Now, I think that the ICC’s position that the party who is responsible in fact and the negligent party shall ultimately bear the loss, it is the correct position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.620" offset="6457812">However, I think it is based on a false premise and therefore the—although the logic is good the conclusion is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.212" offset="6488114">And I say this by going back to the history of master of the master-servant relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.677" offset="6533986">Let us assume that there was no regulation in this case, I think these matters would be governed by traditional questions of respondeat superior, master and servant, agent and principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.578" offset="6593649">I think, well I know that all of the cases that have considered this particular problem, the State cases and the Federal cases, have held the opposite that the lessee operates and trans-operates the vehicle and transports the freight under the common law and under the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.722" offset="6682257">Now, getting back to our assumption that this is a common law rather than a regulation matter, there is no regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.587" offset="6717679">When the lessee takes over control of the truck and of the driver, the driver becomes the special employee of the lessee, he still may remain in the general employee of the lesser but traditionally under our law and I think cases almost all hold this, that in the event of the negligence of the driver in that situation that the responsibility would be the responsibility of the lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.437" offset="6841081">We must remember, of the lessee I am sorry, of the lessee, yes Sir I am sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.263" offset="6924359">A party a lesser to a lessee is not negligent itself it only can be negligent through the act of the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.075" offset="6959572">Now, in this particular situation and the situations, which are generally considered, the driver is driving down the road and it commits a negligent act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.598" offset="6997711">The act is an act of an individual, some employee or co-employer, or corporation, or other party through a legal fiction is responsible for that person’s act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.968" offset="7231141">Now, if there were no regulation, would not Transamerican in many states be able to obtain indemnity against him, just under common law if he were negligent?</text>

            <text syncTime="1795.425" offset="7285058">Yes Sir, they could, against him in the same way in that in this case, Transamerican could obtain indemnity against the driver Hardrick, but you see they are not attempting to obtain indemnity from the driver Hardrick but from Brada Miller who is Hardrick’s general employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.915" offset="7358932">There is a difference there; the driver is always subject to indemnify his principle, whether he be Brada Miller or Transamerican, the driver being the ultimately responsible person is always the person who theoretically at least must pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.425" offset="7441061">And in a situation you gave, the driver being the owner of the truck must pay, the question in this case is must Brada Miller being the general employer of the driver of the truck pay, and I think that is a different issue, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.606" offset="7513786">Now, under common law principles of respondeat superior, I am going to refer the Courts that I have to two Missouri cases one of which Mr. Voorhees was involved in, it is in my brief, Branica versus Transamerican 428 Southwest 2d 524, and Barshed Truck Lines versus Gerry Lips 424 Southwest 2d 81.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.432" offset="7625068">And I think it is the general law throughout the country and always has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.187" offset="7648056">The Courts generally hold that under the common law principles of respondeat superior for a person to become a special employer, three things are necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.694" offset="7702077">First, the employee must consent to enter into the special employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.526" offset="7729453">Second, he must as a matter of fact enter into the special employment and go forward with the employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.966" offset="7755158">And third, the special employer must have the right to control his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.804" offset="7778563">If those three conditions are met, then the driver comes in to the special employ, of in this case Transamerica, and Transamerica would then be liable to the general public for any negligence of the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.129" offset="7855886">Now, were those three conditions met, I think they obviously were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.163" offset="7871977">Hardrick here did enter, did agree to enter into the special employ, he did as a matter of fact enter on to this special employ by driving the truck and Transamerican did have the control, in fact as well as under the regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2194.269" offset="8880408">Alright, I believe that—I believe that the ICC’s position is based on a false premise, MR. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.732" offset="8922204">And the false premise is that the control of the equipment and of the driver remains in the lesser.</text>

            <text syncTime="2216.170" offset="8967971">Now the ICC has stated, and I quote—paraphrase, “the objective of safe operation might be frustrated if the indemnity clause also requires the lesser to indemnify the lessee for the lessee’s negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.334" offset="9032650">In other words the ICC, and if I understand that statement correctly, takes the position that if it’s the indem—if the indem, I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.079" offset="9075595">If the lesser is called upon to indemnify the lessee for the lessee’s own negligence, then the purpose—then the indemnity agreement does then to frustrate the purpose of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.117" offset="9127736">So I think it is very important for us to determine whose negligence is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.463" offset="9149156">Is it the negligence of Hardrick, the negligence of the lesser, or the negligence of the lessee?</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.650" offset="9173920">If the negligence if Hardrick is the negligence of the lessee, then if read the ICC’s brief correctly, then the ICC would take the possession well there it should remain; and it would not be proper under the regulations and it would not follow that the liability should be shifted from a non-negligent—from a negligent to a non-negligent part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.529" offset="9289486">There are also some practical reasons, if might cite someway, these regulations might be con—I am sorry, why these indemnity agreements might be contrary to the regulations and might be against public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.436" offset="9357091">As the Court knows from reading the respondent’s brief, there is a serious question as to whether or not the driver in this case have the right and authority to enter into this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.319" offset="9408604">I know that is not a question for this Court and I know this Court will not decide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.696" offset="9426054">But it brings up an important part—point, here you have a situation where a driver comes up to the doorway of a trucking company with a truck and solicits a load, and it takes a load.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.357" offset="9488748">The lessee describes the cargo, tells him, decides what kind of cargo is to be carried, whether a dangerous cargo or other cargo, how it is to be loaded, where it is to be taken, the route by which it is to be taken, the lessee describes and gives instructions, any especial instructions with regard to the trip itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.159" offset="9583938">The lessee gives the driver expense money, the lessee checks the driver’s medical records, the lessee makes an inspection of the truck itself, in the event of an accident the lessee—the driver reports to the lessee and the lessee in turn reports to the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.759" offset="9674322">I think all of this taken together show a great deal of practical control of the lesser over the trip and the driver and the equipment itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2453.022" offset="9915380">In this particular case Brada Miller did not know of this accident for four months, its investigation of the accident was impeded, the accident was not reported by the lesser for about four months, he report it to the ICC for about four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.295" offset="9984448">It is respondent’s position that if a lessee knows or thinks that it is going to be reimbursed or indemnified for an accident, it does not have the incentive to do what it must do and to make a prompt investigation and attempt to make a prompt settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.985" offset="10059262">I think a rule such as this, I am sorry, I think an indemnity agreement which shifts liability will tend to have an inhibiting effect an investigations and on settlements of claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2532.474" offset="10233238">I should—I would like to close with the following comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.796" offset="10258524">These indemnity agreements at best are questioned, they at best—at worst they actually take the responsibility from where the law places it, and the regulations place it, and the practicality has placed it, and shift it to where it does not belong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.075" offset="10343579">They take it and the respondent’s position to—position the respondent’s takes, the indemnity agreement takes the ultimate financial responsibility from the lessee, who has control under the common law under the regulations and under the practicalities, and puts it in the lesser who does not have those responsibilities and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.705" offset="10446188">Now it seems to me that that is contrary to the intent of the regulations, despite the position of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and contrary to good practice, to good—to good practice in the trucking industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.463" offset="10521212">Why not leave the ultimate responsibility where the law places it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.598" offset="10541692">If for example the negligence is the negligence of the lessee through the driver, leave the ultimate responsibility with the lessee, if the negligence is the negligence of the lessee through some other act of the lessee, then leave the responsibility—the ultimate responsibility with the lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.098" offset="10619746">If on the other hand the lesser is negligent, the lesser is responsible and the lessee would have a cause of action over without an indemnity agreement, allow the law, not the artificial indemnity agreement, to place the ultimate responsibility where it belongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.091" offset="10699680">I think under those circumstances the law would best be served, it would cut down litigation of which there is considerable amount in this area, and unless the Court does take such a position these cases are going to continue to be litigated because the only thing, as I understand, the only question before this Court is whether or not these kinds of agreements are contrary to public policy because of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.556" offset="10821515">If the Court says, no they are not and we will allow them, then we will continue to have litigation under the law of the various states under the provisions of the various contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.301" offset="10872506">I respectfully submit on behalf of respondent that the Court hold that indemnity agreements, which tend to shift liability, from that party who is ultimately responsible under the law to some party who is not responsible under the law should be condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.974" offset="10955262">Then I think, Your Honors, that the regulations will be complied with, the common law would be followed, and the litigation will be terminated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2758.514" offset="11137388">Right, but it also in another part of the agreement states that the lesser, that the driver is not an agent of the lessee but rather remains an agent of the lesser, which is contrary to fact, to common law and to the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.945" offset="11215128">The provisions of the lease in this case, which attempt to both through the indemnity agreement by stating that the driver remains the agent of the lesser and is not the agent of the lessee is contrary to fact in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.964" offset="11291197">There are many provisions of this agreement which attempt to bolster the indemnity—the indemnity agreement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alphonso H. Voorhees</label>
            <text syncTime="2818.026" offset="11375416">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.595" offset="11385656">I have one or two quick comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.284" offset="11400493">First, as I have mentioned earlier the question here is the issue, the narrow issue is what has the Commission done, and I believe that most of Mr. Leritz argument was directed to what should they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.025" offset="11487429">Since I do not believe that is the question I hesitate to get into it, however I note in one of the footnotes in the briefs of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Unites States, they—well as a matter of a fact in a part of their brief including a footnote, they refer to probably what they would do and the beneficial aspects of indemnity agreements in general if they should ever reach the point of regulating this indemnity agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.083" offset="11631625">In this footnote, they refer to a 1973 University of Chicago Law Review Article, which tries to assess or appraise the economic approach to accidents and to the master-servant relationship and to the independent contractor relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.599" offset="11717724">And the gist of the article is that the person writing that article reaches the conclusion that liability should ultimately be with the person who has the most control over the ultimate prevention of the accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.993" offset="11811243">He advocates in this article the use of indemnity agreements to allocate that liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.264" offset="11848337">He says in his view there should not be any distinction between independent contractor and master-servant relationships that it would be ideal for both parties, were at common law liable, and then they could adjust their differences between themselves by means of indemnity agreement, and thereby put the blame on the person who theoretically would be in a best position to prevent accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.468" offset="11969231">And as we have shown here, Brada Miller is the company that would have the control over determining or analyzing latent defects to their equipment that Transamerican may not be able to find by inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.664" offset="12041956">Also, Brada the lesser, is the company that has the ultimate employer-employee control over their driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.858" offset="12074766">They have the means of weeding out drivers with bad driving history, they have the means of disciplinary or discharging, and the best means of providing safe drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.251" offset="12132340">So as I say, even though that is not the question in this case, when we consider various authorities on what should be done, this particular authority cited in the amici curiae brief does endorse and advocate the approach of use of indemnity agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.423" offset="12216977">I think that concludes the petitioner’s argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.629" offset="12225858">Thank you.</text>
