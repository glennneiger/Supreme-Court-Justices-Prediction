            <text syncTime="130.574" offset="625620">If Your Honor please, 1447(d) says exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.613" offset="645787">That an order of remand is not reviewable by appeal, mandamus, prohibition or any writ whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.549" offset="681522">What 1447 contemplates obviously is that there would not be any orders of remand where a case was removed properly, where the District Court had jurisdiction of the case, assumed jurisdiction of the case and then turn around and wrongfully remanded it upon some arbitrary and discretionary basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.704" offset="770129">Why is it not just as possible to say that what 1447(d) contemplates is that Congress rather deliberately chose to avoid the danger of delay that would come from appealing an order of remand, even though that order was erroneous rather than to make sure that an erroneous order of remand was straightened out by the Court of Appeals every time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank G. Dickey, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="190.573" offset="865633">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would agree that Congress did intend not to burden the Circuit Courts of Appeals with review of every order of remand that came along.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.971" offset="919236">1441 provides that any civil action brought in a state court of which the District Courts of the United States have original jurisdiction may be removed by that defendant from the State Court to Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.499" offset="977333">Section 1447(c) provides, if at anytime, before final judgment, it appears that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction then it shall be remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.490" offset="1049326">In any case that it is removed from the State Court to the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.552" offset="1073568">If it is removed and on the face of the petition for removal, it is apparent that there is no jurisdiction, then it is mandatory that that case shall be remanded and there is no review of that order because the petitioner has not complied with the statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.035" offset="1147442">However, if a case is removed properly or providently and if the District Court has jurisdiction then the District Court must assume jurisdiction and cannot remand that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.868" offset="1210763">Otherwise, if it were not so, the District Court could enter an order of remand in any case it saw fit and the petitioners, whether there was jurisdiction or not, would be sent back to State Court without any remedy, without any review of any discretionary or arbitrary decision and I submit that would constitute a denial of due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.514" offset="1345346">Mr. Justice Blackmun, if my memory serves me correctly, there are cases which say that even if the order of remand in a case where there is no jurisdiction and the case goes back to State Court and is tried and comes, in this case, to the Court of Appeals for the Commonwealth of Kentucky, that this Court I believe would say and has stated or at least the Sixth Circuit has stated that that order of remand is not reviewable under Section 1447(d) for the simple reason that that order of remand in that particular case was made because the Court obviously did not have jurisdiction and to hold otherwise, would create a volume of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.128" offset="1563834">In every single case where a defendant thinks that he would be wrongfully denied access to the Federal Courts under his statutory rights which Congress has granted since 1797 -- 89 that statutory right would be denied, that there would be a volume of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.263" offset="1728405">In this case, the petitioners removed this action from the Pike Circuit Court in Pike, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.767" offset="1758394">That action was removed in strict compliance with the removal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.187" offset="1780128">It was properly removed and the respondent has conceded that it was properly removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.922" offset="1803011">In this case, the respondent assumed jurisdiction over this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.564" offset="1821610">The respondent recognized that he had jurisdiction over it and the case stayed in United States District Court for some nine months, after which the respondent took it upon himself to remand the case to the Pike Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.559" offset="1889529">And in this situation where an order of remand was wrongfully entered, the petitioners must have some remedy in as much as the order of remand was based on purely discretionary considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.123" offset="1951804">And based upon considerations that have no foundation whatsoever in the legal scheme or the statutory scheme as far as removal and remand are concerned that until this Court granted certiorari, the petitioners had been denied any remedy whatsoever from the order of remand.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.257" offset="2284396">In 14 cases, there were orders entered show cause why the cases should not be remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.043" offset="2319504">In all but two of those cases, orders of remand were entered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.866" offset="9874743">Improvidence has a deeper meaning, a meaning where the parties intend to provide for the future, that is to provide a more impartial tribunal and bear in mind I say a more impartial tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.900" offset="9946946">So in my view, what the Congress was saying, using the disjunctive or is that whenever the District Court finds that the removal was improvident and that it was not done for the purpose of securing a more impartial tribunal then and under those circumstances, the Court could remand because after all, that was the intent and the purpose of the removal statute in the first instance.</text>
