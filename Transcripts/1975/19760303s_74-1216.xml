            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.268" offset="110656">Here on the Certiorari from the United States of Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.199" offset="130405">The respondent, a Negro, was prosecuted in the Massachusetts's   state court for a violent crime against a white security guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.723" offset="164469">The trial judge questioned veniremen on voir dire as to general bias or prejudice but declined to put a question specifically addressed to racial prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.706" offset="212429">Following conviction and affirmance in the state courts, respondent was granted relief by a District Court in a Federal habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.961" offset="253494">The Court of Appeals affirmed relying on our decision in Ham against South Carolina but Ham does not hold that the constitution requires in every criminal case, involving parties or witnesses of different races that specific questions as to racial prejudice, be asked of venireman.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.358" offset="343042">Ham involved a highly inflammatory situation, where the defendant claimed he had been framed on account of his race.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.204" offset="378464">We view the circumstances, in this case, including the care exercised by the Massachusetts trial court in seeking an impartial jury to be quite different from Ham.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.610" offset="428096">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.135" offset="442203">Mr. Justice White filed a statement concurring in the result, Mr. Justice Marshall filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.450" offset="479401">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
