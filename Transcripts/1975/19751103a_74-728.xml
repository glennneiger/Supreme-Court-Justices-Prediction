            <text syncTime="36.336" offset="248614">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.632" offset="261884">This Court granted Certiorari to determine whether the District Courts have the power to restore victims of hiring discrimination based on race to the present seniority positions which they would have occupied but for the discriminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.205" offset="324160">The issue is presented both under Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other 42 U.S. Code Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.150" offset="359895">The Court Of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held and awarded retroactive seniority beyond the power of the District Courts because in its view, such an award would violate Section 703 (h) of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.660" offset="413917">That Section provides that an employer may lawfully use a bona fide seniority or merit system, provided that it is not the result of an intention to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.225" offset="456235">The Court of Appeals did not specifically address the question under Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.631" offset="481835">The legal issues presented in this case arises in circumstances of unvarnished racial discrimination in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.661" offset="517989">The District Court found that respondent Bowman Transportation had pursued a policy of excluding black employees and applicants from all but a few of the lowest paying most menial jobs in the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.373" offset="580787">The enactment of Title VII had stimulated no change in Bowman’s policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.128" offset="603879">The company continued to discriminate in virtually every aspect of its operations for years after Title VII became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.968" offset="635226">And indeed was still engaged in most of its discriminatory practices at the time of trial in March 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.911" offset="670962">The District Court’s findings as to Bowman’s discriminatory practices read like a virtual catalog of unlawful employment practices under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.315" offset="716624">Maintenance of segregated jobs and segregated departments, a job seniority system, no transfer rules, illegal, unvalidated testing, racial assignment and steering of new employees, word of mouth recruitment and retaliation against those few black employees who tried to better themselves despite this system.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.662" offset="801992">The record presents no mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.821" offset="818606">Before this court specifically, are claims arising from Bowman’s rejection of the applications of qualified black truck driver applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.437" offset="865104">This policy of exclusion remained absolute until the eve of filing of petitioner’s suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.418" offset="896973">Until September 1970, Bowman had never hired a single black over the road driver to fill its approximately 500 road driver jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.973" offset="943262">In September 1970, Bowman began to hire a few black truck drivers at one of its terminals but continued to resist hiring black truck drivers at its other terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.526" offset="993417">At one of its major Truck Driver terminals in Charlotte, the first black truck was hired only a month before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.331" offset="1028630">During the period 1969 to 1971 which is the focus of this claim, hundreds of black truck driver applicants applied to Bowman.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.156" offset="1071993">Many of these applicants were fully qualified under Bowman’s usual standards for hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.264" offset="1100415">During the same time Bowman did hire in excess of 200 white truck drivers each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.468" offset="1129149">Many of this white truck drivers lacked adequate or minimum qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.266" offset="1152346">And up to 150 of these whites were hired as trainees even though they lacked the minimum truck driving experience supposedly required.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.158" offset="1195918">Bowman hired these white trainees upon the personal recommendation of members of its all white or nearly all white road driver work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.264" offset="1236356">When these unqualified whites were hired along with many other whites who were no better qualified than dozens of unsuccessful black applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.561" offset="1273554">They began to accumulate employment date seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.824" offset="1294661">At trial the District Court certified this case as a class action and designated several sub-classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.749" offset="1322351">One of them, denominated class three and represented by petitioner Lee consists of rejected black road driver applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.471" offset="1357251">Over 200 individuals were identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.984" offset="1371252">Those individuals were given notice and were invited to reapply for hiring by Bowman with priority consideration but without retroactive seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.630" offset="1413884">There after, a few class three members reapplied and were hired began to drive trucks for Bowman.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.456" offset="1441156">However, they took as their employment seniority date, the date of their actual hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.572" offset="1469577">Months or even years after they had initially filed their applications and months or even years later than the employment seniority date of many whites who had initially applied at the same time they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.208" offset="1528196">Under the ruling of the Fifth Circuit, these blacks, in their seniority standing will never catch up with the whites who were hired ahead of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.344" offset="1568738">Today or tomorrow, when one of these black employees competes with a contemporary white applicant, he will loose out in bidding and he will have less security from lay-off.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.034" offset="1619415">Moreover, he will have lesser fringe benefits than he can—</text>

            <text syncTime="382.060" offset="1631536">When the seniority is granted, that is at who's expense in a sense, if the seniority is retroactively granted, what happens to the man who -- how’s the seniority now, this is not something that can be divided, is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="402.470" offset="1713247">It has to be taken away from one person in order to give it to another.</text>

            <text syncTime="1911.307" offset="7748578">It is true that the whites who were hired during this intervening period are innocent.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="1984.070" offset="8039582">Well, Congress was concerned about that in a wide variety of context other than the narrow one we are dealing with and if I can get into the statutory analysis, I think I can explain both the nature of that concern and its limits and why it does not extend to this case because there is no question that Congress was concerned about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.394" offset="8124846">Let me start by saying this, I think there is no question that the first sentence of Section 706(g) generally encompassed a Congressional intention to make people whole for the effects of discrimination visited against them to make whole those who suffer the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.824" offset="8198615">And what in essence the Court below said is that there is carved out of this make whole remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.371" offset="8224842">A category of relief which you cannot give even though it would make whole to with the retroactive seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.693" offset="8254100">And so the focus our question has to be is that indeed, why Section 703(h) is in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.367" offset="8280744">Was it put there to put a limit on what would otherwise be legitimate make whole relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.762" offset="8306344">And I suggest that the answer that cannot come by looking first at Section 703(H).</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.574" offset="8329646">The answer to that question has to come by looking at the history of the legislative debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.379" offset="8360888">Because when Congress, when this bill was first introduced and it was a bipartisan bill, Section 706(g) at that time not only had the first sentence to make whole provision, it also had a last sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.301" offset="8416477">And the last sentence was what we have characterized as the anti-preference section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.806" offset="8438524">It said, “You shall not give relief to people who were not the victims of discrimination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.655" offset="8457959">So that on the one hand you shall make whole those who are victims of discrimination, on the other you shall not give preference to those who were not victims of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.725" offset="8498188">Now though -- the statutory language was very clear or the language of the bill was very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.468" offset="8521175">That did not prevent its declaimers from going all over the countryside suggesting that that indeed was not what Title VII was going to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.944" offset="8559105">And there was voice both on the floor of Congress and throughout the land because the period of time we are talking about was during the presidential primary of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.023" offset="8599438">The impending Title VII was an issue of great debate during that primary and at least one candidate made the defeat of that bill, one of his major issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.258" offset="8644369">And so we have the anomaly of Unions appearing before Congress saying “enact the statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.640" offset="8665894">Well Congressmen were being inundated by letters from presumably white workers saying, “Do not pass that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.347" offset="8692748">That statute is going to give all kinds preferences to people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.579" offset="8705600">Because indeed the detractors were saying this statute will give preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.389" offset="8728901">And we were in the midst of a three month filibuster over this bill and the floor managers of the bill, Senators Clark and Case introduced literally an avalanche of written legislative history designed to reassure all of these concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.215" offset="8788147">The theme of that repeatedly was this bill though it is designed to end discrimination and make whole its victims, is not intended to give any preferences to anybody on a count of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.026" offset="8835376">It is not designed to -- in one fell swoop cure an entire national history of discrimination all its designed to do is to make sure that from this day forward, employers and Union shall not discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.073" offset="8895562">And that the victims of that discrimination which occurs from this day forward will be made whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.257" offset="8916356">There will be no qoutas, there will not be no special seniority rights as they called it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.131" offset="8935895">We are just going to stop discrimination as of this date and give remedies to those who suffer any continued discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.908" offset="9238916">What 703(h) does and its part of a mosaic was that after the sponsors had literally grown hoarse resisting claims that this statute was a preference statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.994" offset="9283324">They were still confronted with the filibuster and they were still confronted with people screaming that indeed it did create preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.318" offset="9312581">And so there was a whole revision of the bill, the so called “Dirksen-Mansfield Compromise Bill” which reincorporated the central provisions of the statute intact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2486.865" offset="10050802">Watkins is the clearest one, but there are a range, we are not suggesting that we have the answer all at one time for the entire range of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.253" offset="10088313">What for example of the employee who did not apply for a job in 1970 because he knew this company did not hire blacks but who comes forward in 1972 and says, “I should get two years of seniority would have been feudal to apply.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.848" offset="10146723">That involves some of the fact type questions this Court dealt with in Blue Chips Stamps and in an entirely different context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.450" offset="10173159">We are not suggesting the answer to that, I think that is something that has to be litigated in the future but from that litigation will emerge an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.439" offset="10201058">That person either is or is not the victim of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.867" offset="10218821">The ultimate determination is that he is a victim of discrimination then he will be entitled to make whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="2543.083" offset="10275664">And so the line we see is a very clear one but it is important to see both sides of the line because if you only try to look at one as petitioners do, you slide into the problem that everybody says “But where does this line stop.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.700" offset="10322162">And to us the line is very clear, the two sides of it at least in this case are clear and this case falls on the make whole side.</text>

            <text syncTime="2579.968" offset="10423203">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.157" offset="10439922">We are not seeking to sustain Court of Appeal's interpretation of Section 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.531" offset="10477433">We agree with the other parties that the interpretation is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.994" offset="10503347">That is our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.066" offset="10511602">We do not agree with everything that the other parties are saying en route to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.169" offset="10540023">We think that it is clear form the legislative history and from that terms and words of the statute itself that this Section was intended to have a definite effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.052" offset="10591536">It was intended to place a limitation both on the substantive provisions of Title VII and on the remedies that are available under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.341" offset="10640646">Now there has been discussion of the distinction between pre-act discrimination and post-act discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.562" offset="10677531">That distinction, I would I say is a starting point, I would consider valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.180" offset="10699997">However, I would go farther than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.389" offset="10708878">I think that Congress was drawing a distinction here between the discrimination which is the subject of the case that is specifically before the Court indicates and for which it is framing a remedy, as compared with general discrimination in the past which is it not seeking to remedy in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.653" offset="10801979">For example, I think that Congress foresaw the concept which has developed under this statute, I might say different from anything under the National Labor Relations Act to which it has been compared under which practices which are racially neutral in themselves are held to be violative of the Act because of their continuation of the effects of past discrimination including pre-act discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.934" offset="10923082">Now, Congress apparently saw that and the legislative history demonstrates that it was consigned that the statute would taken its sweep, seniority rights under numerous seniority systems over the country either under Union Contracts or under company policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.329" offset="11000614">Well, the system itself had been affected by race discrimination in the past and even those that might be affected by racial discrimination in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.245" offset="11048261">So, we think that is the important distinction in Section 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.049" offset="11075533">Now, concededly here, the discrimination that we are talking about occurred after Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.304" offset="11108552">Consequently, we are not talking about just a system that continuously affect the past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.072" offset="11143660">Now its our view that in the case of this kind that the Court has the same kind of discretion that the National Labor Relations Board would have and has had for a number of years in framing remedies for discrimination cases under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.782" offset="11218475">It has been noted that the remedial provisions of this act were to some extent modeled after the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.372" offset="11252852">It is always been considered under that statute, that the restoration of seniority for discharged employee is a part of his reinstatement, was an available remedy, usually they ought to reach without prejudice to seniority all other rights and privileges previously enjoy it or some similar wording and a similar remedy has frequently been framed for employees who had discriminatorily rejected for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.614" offset="11373747">Now we think that those remedies were intended to be available at the discretion of the Court that was framing the remedy under Title VII, just as they were under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.339" offset="11436650">Now, we think though that the discretion of the court still has an important role.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.154" offset="11463922">Now I am aware of course of the decision of this Court in the Albemarle case, I am aware of the holdings that the discretion calls for judgment and not just inclination and that it must be exercised consistently with purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.652" offset="11541975">We submit that there was support in this record for the action which the District Court took and that he did act properly within his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.887" offset="11582831">Now on appeal, the Court of Appeals, although making this interpretation of Section 703(h) concluded with the holding that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in withholding this remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.545" offset="11641450">Now, I want to refer particularly to the factual situation that was before the Court, there had been exhaustive discovery before this case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.181" offset="11684082">These people were identified clearly and full information had been provided to the other parties, about all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.452" offset="11713130">There were some 200 of these applicants in this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.341" offset="11728699">They got all the documents relating to them and had a full information about the company’s action on each case including the reasons advanced by the company for the disqualification of different ones under the criteria that the company was applying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.822" offset="11802573">They had full opportunity to interview these people, there was nothing to keep them from it and I might say that answers to subject when interrogators have indicated that they did in fact interview them though I assume they did not interview all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.030" offset="11859415">Two of them in addition to the class representative himself testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.638" offset="11885851">Also witnesses for the company testified about the way in which different individuals were disqualified that were in this group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.616" offset="11921796">Now, the District Court on the basis of this record made the statement as part of the basis for his denial of his relief that there was no evidence in the record on which he could base the multiple conclusions necessary for an award of retroactive seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.670" offset="12009985">Also, I think the fact that it makes very little difference in this particular case, under the facts that seniority has such a small effect among the road drivers in view of the high rate of turn over and also in view of the fact that there is very little by way of job benefits that really depends on seniority.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <label>Mr. Morris J. Baller</label>
            <text syncTime="3454.403" offset="13920895">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.329" offset="13928627">Just a couple of brief points in rebuttal as to mootness, our position is that because the existence of class members where their lives stake in the controversy and a certified class action, the case does fit within the Sosna Rule and it is viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.782" offset="13994455">Moreover, Johnny Lee had a life claim at the time the case was certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.548" offset="14013473">With respect to discretion I submit that the Court reviews what the District Court and the Court of Appeals actually held, it will see quite clearly that this was not an exercise of discretion nor was it affirmed as such by the Court of Appeals rather they were erroneous rules of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.676" offset="14085989">With respect to the effect of this on, presumably innocent white employees, I would simply note that as the court has frequently held, seniority being contractual is subject to modification to conform with law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.287" offset="14172506">And focusing on the innocence of affected employees would create the kind of subjective standard which this Court has abjured in Griggs and other employment discrimination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.556" offset="14229557">Finally with regard to the reliance by Mr. Gottesman on the Clark Case materials to create a distinction between pre-act and post-act discrimination which he conceives is reflected nowhere in the statute itself, I would simply state to the Court our position that the Lower Courts have made it clear that Clark Case materials cannot be read literally to convey the Congressional intention on their face, they are far broader than both the terms of the statute and broader than any construction, the Court’s have been willing to give in stating that no pre-1965 seniority rights would ever be affected by any Title VII action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.579" offset="14417639">That simply has not been an acceptable interpretation in the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.559" offset="14441567">Finally, I would just call to the Court's attention that all we seek is the same as this Court has accorded to all claims of employment discrimination brought under Title VII from Griggs through Albemarle Paper that is a construction which assures that victims of discrimination will have a chance to prove in court that they were wrong and upon proof of discrimination that they are entitled to ask complete relief as is possible in the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.224" offset="14568209">We fee that this petitioners deserve no less.</text>

            <text syncTime="3625.797" offset="14606557">Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.793" offset="14614498">Section 1981 is a separate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.326" offset="14628604">We feel that the interference with contractual rights in the nature of seniority benefits, is it violates the prohibition in Section 1981 on discrimination in making an enforcement of contracts and there should be a cause of action with a right retroactive seniority to restore those contractual benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.217" offset="14732153">Congress specifically rejected amendments that would have made Title VII the exclusive remedy for employment discrimination and as this Court held in Alexander, it did not mean in enacting Title VII to repeal pre-existing remedies.</text>
