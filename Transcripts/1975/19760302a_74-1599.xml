            <text syncTime="78.231" offset="416206">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.975" offset="431253">Prior to 1972, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act did not apply to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.675" offset="473989">In 1972, Title VII was amended so as to make unlawful under Title VII, discrimination by Federal agencies and departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.361" offset="520801">The 1972 Amendments also provided to federal employees and applicants for employment a right to file a civil action in a United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.387" offset="572837">The question in this case is what is the nature and the scope of that civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.227" offset="600213">Petitioner contends that it is a plenary judicial proceeding and the respondents contend that it is a review of the administrative record pursuant to a substantial evidence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.204" offset="660086">Petitioner is a black female employee of the Veterans Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.843" offset="682655">In 1972, she applied for a GS-13 supervisory claims examiner position.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.274" offset="708360">She was designated as highly qualified for the position but a Filipino-American male was selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.199" offset="740125">She thereupon filed a compliant alleging that she had been discriminated against on the basis of her race and sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.830" offset="770636">An investigation was conducted and after the investigation petitioner was offered the option of either receiving a final agency decision on the basis of the investigative file without an administrative evidentiary hearing or the option of receiving a final agency decision after an administrative evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.415" offset="861020">She selected the second option.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.179" offset="871991">Petitioner is not an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.453" offset="877111">She represented herself at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.250" offset="888291">She requested that 24 witnesses be called to testify and the examiner declined to call 15 of the 24 witnesses requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.728" offset="926221">Nevertheless, the examiner found partially in petitioner’s favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.927" offset="947015">She found that petitioner had been discriminated against on the basis of her sex but that she had not been discriminated against on the basis of her race.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.671" offset="985989">The examiner recommended that petitioner be promoted immediately and retroactively to the position in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.963" offset="1019113">The examiner’s findings however are only recommendations to the head of the agency or his designee and the Veterans Administration accepted the examiners finding that there had been no race discrimination but rejected the finding that there had been sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.076" offset="1087658">Petitioner at that point had the option of filing suit in the District Court or appealing to the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.841" offset="1118691">She chose the second option.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.344" offset="1124647">The Civil Service Commission affirmed the agency’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.988" offset="1143246">This suit followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.536" offset="1149411">In the District Court petitioner sought discovery, she sought initially to take two depositions and she requested production of documents in connection with one of these depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.570" offset="1197581">The District Court however granted summary judgment on the basis of the administrative record in favor of the defendants with no discovery and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.031" offset="1251393">The positions -- the issue in this case is sharply drawn and the positions of the parties on stark conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.215" offset="1292144">I think that the issue can be stated in terms of two interrelated questions: One, who is the finder of fact in this kind of case, is it the Court or is it the agency; and secondly what evidence may be considered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.390" offset="1372915">May the Court consider all relevant evidence or is the Court limited to considering the evidence contained in the administrative record?</text>

            <text syncTime="326.073" offset="1407606">Do you admit that the possibility that the mode of trial in a District Court might be one way had there been no appeal to the Civil Service Commission but on another way if as in this case there was, I suppose, you, representing the clients you do, would not admit of any possibility that -- because your client did take an appeal to the Civil Service Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.290" offset="1504468">And the statute specifically contemplates that suit maybe filed in either situation and makes no distinction between them.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.678" offset="1534038">But the suit maybe filed within 30 days after the final agency decision, as I understand it.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.252" offset="1556295">Or within 15 days after the final agency decision then appeal maybe taken to Civil Service Commission then it is a 180-day.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.024" offset="1587433">I know the option, but my question was do you -- and probably I know now your answer because I realize the position that your client is in.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.468" offset="1621183">But it just occurred to me that the answer might be -- the mode of trial might be in one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.710" offset="1650126">where there was no appeal with Civil Service Commission and in another way where there was.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.761" offset="1666322">Well, of course, I would also point out that the only thing added by the appeal to the Civil Service Commission is a further, is a review of the record by the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.005" offset="1707282">There is no additional opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.218" offset="1720135">There is an opportunity to make representations, written representations to the Commission but there is no hearing --</text>

            <text syncTime="417.888" offset="1774887">Petitioner’s position on this two interrelated issues is that the Court is the finder of fact and that the plaintiff should be permitted to discover and introduce all relevant evidence pursuant to the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures applied in all other Title VII cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.445" offset="1849075">If the Court adopts our theory, plaintiffs, in federal sector cases, would have no more procedural rights in District Courts than plaintiffs in any other Title VII cases and they would have no less rights in District Courts than all other plaintiffs.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.858" offset="1994734">There can be no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.858" offset="2002780">It is a finding of an agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="570.530" offset="2385421">It depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case and I would think that the same would apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.335" offset="2408618">But the important thing about the footnote in Alexander is that it says that the administrative decision is admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.546" offset="2445503">It maybe accorded some weight but that refers to its weight as one piece of evidence along with any other evidence that it is admitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.576" offset="2513630">And I would like to respond on that but I would like to finish what I was saying about the footnote which is that the record is admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.695" offset="2554068">It is entitled to whatever weight makes sense in the particular circumstances, but that does not mean that it maybe used as a reason for excluding other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.865" offset="2594819">And the Court goes on in the footnote in Alexander to say that it is the duty of the courts to assure the full availability of the judicial forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.960" offset="2627106">Now, the arbitration process is not a statutory proceeding under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.680" offset="2654064">However, in Alexander the Court also considered and rejected a proposed rule of deferral to arbitral decisions which the Fifth Circuit had adopted in the case called Rios against Reynolds Metal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.748" offset="2706309">And the conditions which the Fifth Circuit set for deferral were, one that the contractual right must coincide with rights under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.192" offset="2748105">Two, and I -- well, I will not go into them unless the Court wishes but there were a number of conditions which would have to be satisfied under the Rios test for deferring to an arbitral decision and the very first condition was that the arbitral, the rights under the contract must be congruent with Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.204" offset="2824174">And the Court held in Alexander that even if that were so deferral would be inappropriate and there should be a trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.295" offset="2868477">Now the Government’s position is explicitly that the agency is the finder of fact in these matters subject to substantial evidence review in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.926" offset="2923021">And that the court should normally defer to the findings and decision of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.079" offset="2955622">Furthermore, the Government’s position is that in the ordinary case there is no discovery in the District Court and the record before the reviewing court must be limited to the record made by the defendants -- by the defendant agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.645" offset="3005882">Under this rule, the Federal Government would be placed in a class all by itself exempt from plenary judicial scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.759" offset="3046319">We think that it is important to understand what review on the record pursuant to a substantial evidence test means.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.766" offset="3074427">And Professor Jaffe has explained it as follows, under the substantial evidence test the Court will be required to sustain a finding which it believes to be incorrect and even against the weight of evidence, because it is the agency and not the Court which finds the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.350" offset="3148719">So long as there is substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole that could support the agency’s decision, the Court must accept that decision even if it would believe it to be wrong making an independent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.620" offset="3205771">We think that such a posture by a District Court in a Federal Sector Title VII cases would be wholly inconsistent with the Court’s function as the finder of fact and as the decider of what relief should be provided.</text>

            <text syncTime="892.140" offset="3671900">No, and that is the second point in our favor Mr. Justice Stewart which is that even that draft legislation did not apply to the federal sector and federal sector cases were governed by completely different section of the draft legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.773" offset="3734384">Now, I think it is important to consider one of the arguments which was made in favor of cease and desist and Court of Appeals review in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.951" offset="3783077">And that argument was that it would be to too much of a burden on the District Courts to trial these cases de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.881" offset="3814842">There was repeated reference to the problem of congestion in the dockets of the lower courts and a repeatedly expressed reason in favor of agency enforcement rather than court enforcement in the private sector was that this would relieve the burdens on the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.591" offset="3893627">That argument may have been valid, but it was rejected by the Congress, and I think that that has special significance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.252" offset="3932288">In that regard, this is why we believe that the comments of Senator Dominick have special significance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.288" offset="3968442">There would be no 1972 Amendments without Senator Dominick because couture could not have been obtained unless the Congress had agreed to Senator Dominick’s Amendment which would have substituted -- which would have indeed substitute court enforcement in the private sector for cease and desist enforcement in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.571" offset="4057571">And that Senator Dominick repeatedly expressed his concern that all parties, plaintiffs and defendants in private industry, in state and local governments and in the Federal Government should have their claims adjudicated pursuant to the same procedures and by the same fact finder, i.e., by an independent United States District Judge who would independently determine the merits of their case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.627" offset="5721780">It is further significant that whereas we are concerned today with the adjudication of a particular complaint, this adjudication process is a part, an integral part, of a much larger whole equal employment opportunity effort by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.975" offset="5807253">It is all subject to the Direction Office, it is under a single office, under a single director, and additional component parts of this overall effort are in addition to the adjudication process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.715" offset="5854169">There is a continuing process carried out by the Bureau of Personnel and Management Evaluation, which evaluates programs on a continuing basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.283" offset="5888442">In addition, the statute charges the Civil Service Commission with the review and approval of equal employment opportunity plans on a regional and national level and finally the Civil Service Commission is charged with training an upward mobility, affirmative action programs throughout the entire Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.367" offset="5964824">So that the Federal Judge, when he considers a particularly equal employment opportunity case, gets the picture that is presented by that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.869" offset="6002753">The Civil Service Commission, by contrast, has the adjudication process as a component part of a much broader overall program and this, this was the thrust of Judge Gisele’s opinion in Hackley versus Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.897" offset="6070881">He made the very significant observation which is true that it is almost impossible in the usual case, federal case, to differentiate between claims appear discrimination on the one hand and the related problems, the necessarily related problems of promotion, hiring, training and general affirmative action and up -- well, no, promotion, hiring and training and the great majority of the cases are promotion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.031" offset="6191462">Judge Gisele’s conclusion in a single statement -- in a single sense which I quote is, that “the commission’s growing expertise in civil rights matters coupled with its preeminent expertise in this latter areas emphasizes that an automatic trial de novo will not the serve the laudable purpose of the act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.093" offset="6271710">It is further instructive to note as was pointed out by Mr. Justice White that regardless of how you decide this case, the Government is going to be in a class by itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.592" offset="6753722">And the attempts at that point at the very most informal lever to achieve some kind of an agreement to find out what it is that has happened in the C, if he cannot work it out at that level and a lot percentage of them are worked out at that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.071" offset="6807638">If within 21 days that has not been done then the aggrieved employee files a formal complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.041" offset="6839508">And at that point there is an investigator who is appointed to make an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.410" offset="6856957">The investigator comes from within the agency but he cannot be under the supervision of the person who is alleged to have discriminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.651" offset="6905963">The investigation is really the heart, initially of the inquiry into discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.425" offset="6940967">He has full authority to ask questions, to interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.417" offset="6956954">It is not an adversary process; it is an inquisitorial process, and he prepares an investigation file which is a report of what he has found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.668" offset="7005960">The next step is that an attempt at adjustment of the complaint is attempted on the basis of that investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.903" offset="7042949">In the event that an adjustment of the complaint can not be achieved, then the complainant indicates that he wants a hearing, and that is when the Civil Service Commission appoints its hearing examiner and the hearing is held within the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.600" offset="7101673">Fortunately we have a good record in this case and I would simply commend to the Court that you might want to read the record of the hearing in this case because I think it is an example of how a hearing can operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.700" offset="7150156">The individual was entitled to be represented by a counsel, he is not required to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.754" offset="7162277">In this case, Mrs. Chandler represented herself and frankly in my opinion she did a good job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.889" offset="7186832">There is a representative of the agency present as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.535" offset="7205431">In this case it would appear that the representative of the agency was not a lawyer but in any event he would not take a vigorous adversary procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.658" offset="7237927">The complaints examiner renders a recommended decision and makes, in effect, findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.867" offset="7266766">That is forwarded to the agency itself which makes the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.362" offset="7284739">From that point the complainant has two options: He can either go direct to Court or he can go to -- or he can appeal to the Appeals Review Board of the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.873" offset="7322773">And following 180 days of the filing either with the Civil Service Commission or with the agency it has the right go into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.903" offset="7362897">The issue, it seems to us, is that whether it is more consistent with these overall Civil Service Commission responsibilities and the fact of integration of the adjudication process with a much broader federal equal employment opportunity effort to relegate the Civil Service Commission to the role of an examiner or the provider, if you will, of address rehearsal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.313" offset="7468536">The traditional tandem of agency and Court in affecting congressional policy and in utilizing scarce federal resources for this purpose, works best when the agency brings it expertise to bear on substantive policy matters integrating its broader rule making authority with its adjudicatory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.296" offset="7560487">And the Court is doing what they do best, correcting errors of law, errors of procedure, excesses of statutory power or constitutional right and correcting factual errors only when they do rise to their level of excesses of substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.010" offset="7623390">And this, we submit, is what Congress must have meant by integrating the complaint adjudicating process as a part of the Commissions broader equal employment opportunity in federal and federal merit system responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.060" offset="7675531">And giving the Commission, on parallel, remedial powers. Senator Williams stated at the conclusion after all of the amendment -- at the time that all of the amendments were made, and the Senate Committee Report also states early in the legislative history that an important adjunct to the strengthened Civil Service Commission responsibilities is the statutory provision of a private right of action or review of the agency proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.597" offset="7785663">That right of review is Senator Williams language later on, that right of review language does not appear in the Senate Committee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.390" offset="7816905">But the point I would like to make is that both regarded it as an adjunct to the strengthened Civil Service Commission responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.582" offset="7857656">It is significant in this regard that this Court’s decision in Alexander versus Gardner-Denver, as I read it, relies principally on the fact that in the private, in the arbitration context up until the time that you got into Court, the complainant had not had the access to any official body of the Federal Government that had either the authority or the responsibility for implementing and for fleshing out the details and implementing of equal employment opportunity policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.750" offset="8022332">The statement is made a number of ways in a number of different places in the Gardner-Denver opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.434" offset="8049082">But the thrust is always the same that the responsibility of the arbitrator is to implement the contract whereas the responsibility of the Civil Service Commission by contrast is to implement the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.783" offset="8102476">The arbitrator simply has no responsibility to implement the federal policy contained in the 1972 Amendments, by contrast, the Civil Service Commission does and that is its principle responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.922" offset="8167051">Now, Justice Stewart asked the question whether there would be any difference whether you appeal to the -- directly to the appeals -- you appeal directly from the agency or you go through the Appeals Review Board and I think it is apparent, and now that my answer to that question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.953" offset="8235073">And the reason is that under either circumstance it is, we do have this tandem of agency responsibility and Court responsibility with each doing the kind of things that they do best.</text>

            <text syncTime="2336.759" offset="9450394">What we are talking about Mr. Chief Justice is the period of time that it takes from the filing of a complaint up until the time that the administrative record is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.005" offset="9499295">You have 180 days at the agency level and you also have 180 days at the Civil Service Commission Appeals Review Board in the event that they elect that option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.668" offset="9553944">And I should also point out that with the proposed adoption of class action procedures, we are likely to have other cases in which the elapsed time is even greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.350" offset="9608696">We do not see this as a significant problem insofar as the present issue is concern for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.484" offset="9629281">In the average case where -- be at the 201 or 218, by the time the Court reaches the issue there will be an administrative record, because with 180 days just in the time that it takes to file an answer, you would be up to the 218 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.345" offset="9708693">But let us take the case in which it is not 218 maybe it is 300, it is our view that what the Court should do under those circumstances for the reasons that we have been talking about is that Court should entertain a stay motion and should first inquire to determine what the reason is for the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.971" offset="9783194">If the Court finds that it is for any reason other than the fault of the agency, the Court should then favorably entertain a stay motion and should wait for the completion of the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.239" offset="9844216">In the event that the delay is due to the agency’s fault then it would be appropriate for the Court to proceed with de novo review or to take other steps that might -- that are within the discretion of the reviewing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.902" offset="9930943">Finally, the point has or it is also been argued that there is a problem insofar as the procedures are concerned with the examiner being the only one who has had the opportunity to observe the -- it is a credibility problem, the demeanor problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.938" offset="10019028">In that respect there are some cases in which credibility and demeanor may occupy a large part of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.598" offset="10065735">In those instances, in those instances, if the agency and the Commission have not followed the commissioner, the examiner’s decision, then under the traditional rules of review that were established by this Court in the Universal Camera case, the Court can reverse on that ground alone that inadequate consideration was given to what the examiner did, and similarly another alternative would be simply to remand the case for further consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.004" offset="10195302">In this particular case, credibility was not a large issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.863" offset="10218812">There really -- it was not a substantial issue insofar as what happened, who was telling the truth and who was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.492" offset="10245248">The principal issue in this case was whether it is more important in selecting section chiefs to rely on individual specific kinds of skills such as the ability to read computer printouts and experience in specific phases of the agency’s work or whether the larger more subjective kinds of skills such as the ability to motivate people are concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2602.905" offset="10514936">In conclusion we submit that Congress has made a comprehensive effort to assure equal employment opportunity in the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.748" offset="10554329">It is an effort that consists of several interlocking components, including review of equal opportunity, employment opportunity plans, training, upward mobility, affirmative action, adjudication of grievances, complete with full remedial authority that is unparalleled anywhere is either within Government or outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.830" offset="10634682">The administration of this total integrated whole is charged to the Civil Service Commission already preeminent and unique in its expertise and areas of hiring, training and promotions which are the consistent touchstones of equal opportunity issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.388" offset="11072912">In fact, it even cuts our way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.276" offset="11080435">The fact is that notwithstanding that concern, Congress said several things, one is that notwithstanding that concern the Civil Service Commission, they did choose the Civil Service Commission and in that respect in order to assist it yet the committee was persuaded that Civil Service Commission’s sincereness, dedication to principles of equal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.201" offset="11156086">In order to assist the Commission in accomplishing these goals to make clear the Congressional expectation, it was given responsibilities to function in developing a comprehensive equal employment opportunity program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.168" offset="11215958">The fact of the matter is that notwithstanding those concerns which were thoroughly erred in Congress, it was the total responsibility that was clearly placed in the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.369" offset="11256814">And I do not want to give the impression that I do not think that it is working.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.069" offset="11275622">You look at the statement by Chairman Hampton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.188" offset="11292027">My friends have indicated the performance of the EEOC with regard to back pay awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.915" offset="11315015">Well, that is all really that the EEOC can get the through the courts is back pay awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.189" offset="11332046">But in the Federal sector, far more important than back pay is GS grade, because that relates not only to money it also relates to future status and to other employment considerations that are equally as important as money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.639" offset="11389829">And as that report shows at the same time that federal employment is been going down, we have had a perceptible improvement at all of the GS levels insofar as minorities are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.670" offset="11437999">But the principle point is that whether it is succeeding or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.826" offset="11454613">If there are statutes -- if the Commission has acted in excess of its statutory responsibility, then that is a basis for complaint in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.084" offset="11479691">That is the kind of thing that Courts do well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.541" offset="11489513">If in fact they are saying that Congress made the wrong judgment in giving this kind of responsibility to the Civil Service Commission then the remedy there is in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.669" offset="11534025">But you cannot simply, you cannot simply say that -- you cannot simply make a subjective judgment that the Civil Service Commission has not been doing as well as it ought to do and therefore rejected the judgment that Congress made but this is where the responsibility lies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3016.931" offset="12170995">Mr. Justice Marshall credulity is certainly was an issue in this case and I would direct the Court’s attention to Pages 63 through 67 of the certified administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.730" offset="12218224">These pages are not produced in the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.418" offset="12225016">It is part of the testimony of the selecting supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.789" offset="12238495">The Civil Service Commission, in affirming the agency decision, repeatedly relied upon the explanations of the selecting supervisor as to why he selected Mr. DeNiro (ph) rather than Mrs. Chandler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.808" offset="12286561">And if you look at the pages that I am citing you to, I think you will see the reason why the complaints examiner at least find no credibility in those explanations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.086" offset="12327625">The Court, of course, had no opportunity to hear Mr. Holland (ph) testify and one of the first acts that petitioner did in District Court was to try to take Mr. Holland’s deposition and I suppose you would have called him as a witness in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.845" offset="12382691">Now it is also suggested that these cases are so complicated and it is so difficult to distinguish between discrimination and a valid personnel procedure that the courts will not be able to understand these cases and deal with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.363" offset="12452804">At Page 11 in Footnote 14 of our reply brief, we have cited the case of United States against United States Steel Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.912" offset="12490943">That is a case in which the Government was the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.869" offset="12510796">We would commend that the Court’s attention and there are several different opinions in there, that is a case which is extremely complicated and yet the Court was able to deal with it, the lines of progression, the way in which the United States Steel in Birmingham operates, requires a great deal of expertise to even begin to understand what is going on at the United States Steel Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.775" offset="12614450">And yet the Courts have to deal with this kind of thing everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.179" offset="12624063">They also have to deal with testing which is extremely complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.611" offset="12641722">Now we think it is significant with respect to the question of a hearing that the statute does not require that these cases be determined after a hearing nor is the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.127" offset="12687802">In the draft legislation providing for cease and desist review in the private sector and review on the record on the record in the Court of Appeals, the Committee bill, the Hawkins bill, those draft legislation required that hearings be conducted by the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.548" offset="12761467">They also contain the stay provision to which counsel referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.868" offset="12778812">Of course neither the stay provision nor the provision requiring a hearing a hearing in the private sector is contained in the statute as enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.763" offset="12810368">And I do not think it is the function of the Court to read things into the statute which are not there particularly when they were there under antecedent draft legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.124" offset="12919769">Now of course I would like to say something about the middle positions which have been assumed by some of the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.723" offset="12954251">Obviously this Court is not bounded by the positions advocated by either party but we feel very strongly that these middle positions are also completely inadequate and we have discussed the reasons for this at some length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.768" offset="13018407">Indeed we think the Government’s position implicitly recognizes that there is no middle ground in this area either the Court is the finder of fact or the agency is the finder of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3238.625" offset="13057800">Now the Government case, if not a middle position, it does not take -- it admits of exceptions to what it -- to the rule that it advocates.</text>

          <turn speaker="joel_l_selig" startTime="3245.523" stopTime="3247.191">
            <label>Mr. Joel L. Selig</label>

            <text syncTime="3247.191" offset="13092073">But it concedes 54:08 that the rule it advocates maybe inadequate or defective in certain circumstances, is that correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel L. Selig</label>
            <text syncTime="3258.419" offset="13137003">That is correct, but -- and I think the exceptions that they are recognizing are very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.025" offset="13163439">But Mr. Justice Stewart I think the problem -- there are several problems with this middle rules which some of the lower courts have adopted and which are not being advocated by the Government, but one big problem with them is that they put the burden on the wrong party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.171" offset="13224043">They put the burden on the plaintiff to show a need to go beyond the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.287" offset="13248494">They put a burden on the plaintiff to show that it is necessary to have discovery, that it is necessary to have other witnesses testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.572" offset="13281617">Well, under the federal Rules of Civil Procedure if discovery is inappropriate, it is the defendant’s burden to show that it is inappropriate under the rules and under the applicable case law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3340.284" offset="13464474">Well, as we have said, we assume that the administrative record is admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.783" offset="13482446">We also assume that duplication without a purpose can be prevented by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.651" offset="13509927">But I think the important phrases as Judge Leventhal stated it, duplication without a purpose, sometimes there is a purpose in duplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.189" offset="13536050">Frequently in antitrust cases, there are large numbers of depositions that have been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.937" offset="13551096">This is true in many areas of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.458" offset="13565098">I think finally that -- of course it is conceded by the Government as it would have to be conceded in the light of Morton against Mancari that what we are up to here is providing the same substantive law, the same substantive rights in the federal sectors and the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.436" offset="13633016">It is our position basically that you cannot separate substance and procedure in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.457" offset="13661124">And this is why we believe the Court noted in Alexander that the choice of forms inevitably affects the scope of the substantive right to be vindicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.113" offset="13707726">And this is why we believe that the general principle which is applicable here is the principle stated in the House Committee Report and quoted by the Court in Mancari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.264" offset="13760389">And that is that the present law in the proposed statute do not permit industry and labor organizations to be the judges of their own conduct in the area of employment discrimination, and there is no reason why government agencies should not be treated similarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.251" offset="13824337">Thank you.</text>
