            <text syncTime="46.555" offset="289562">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.846" offset="302728">The statute issue in this case provides that pistols, revolvers and other firearms capable of being concealed on the person are not mailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.496" offset="345255">Interpretive regulations of the Postal Service provide that the phrase, all other firearms capable of being concealed on the person includes what is not limited to short barrel shotguns and riffles.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.644" offset="397918">And that a short barrel shotgun includes but it is not limited to shotguns with barrels less than 18-inches in length and an overall length of less that 26-inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.130" offset="443789">Respondent was indicted for mailing a sort-of shotgun from one part of the State of Washington to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.428" offset="468971">The evidence introduced at trial demonstrated that a shotgun with a barrel length of 10-inches and an overall length of 22-inches sort of both on the barrel and on the stock was mailed by respondent to Mrs. Theresa Bailey who apparently was not its intended recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.273" offset="548383">Mrs. Bailey turned the weapon over to the FBI and the FBI turned the evidence over to the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.045" offset="579521">Respondent admitted buying a shotgun but denied ever having altered it or mailing it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="128.384" offset="616824">This shotgun had a barrel length of 10-inches and an overall length of 22-inches, actually 22 and 1/8-inches including the stock and the barrel.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="138.208" offset="656112">So it is well within the regulation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="139.613" stopTime="246.078">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="139.613" offset="661754">It is well within the regulations and in fact it is well within the numerical definitions set out in other Federal Statutes and in the Washington State Statutes prohibits the possession of similar sort-of shotguns with barrels less than 12-inches in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.187" offset="728105">The Jury was instructed that in order to convict, it had to find not only that respondent mailed the weapon but that the weapon was capable of being concealed on the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.736" offset="766244">The Jury returned the verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.577" offset="777634">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the statute is vague as to all weapons that were designed as shoulder weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.465" offset="809190">Apparently no matter how small or readily concealable the weapon maybe or whether it was so altered that it is no longer capable of being used as a shoulder weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.853" offset="858718">The Court held that the phrase capable of being concealed on the person is so uncertain in scope and application that it cannot constitutionally be used by Congress and the Congress should instead have used numerical definitions as it has done in other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.556" offset="925487">The Court did not refer the Postal Service Regulation and the Court made no attempts to clarify or construe the statute in such a way that it would alleviate the vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.724" offset="966238">The only issue before the Court therefore is whether the phrase other firearms capable of being concealed on the person is so devoid if meaning that it cannot be used to support punishment even if the particular shotgun is, as the Jury found in this case, capable of being concealed on the person, and even if there is an entire class of weapons clearly capable of being concealed on the person, our point of departure is the general principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.395" offset="2456889">It is an argument that the statutes words are so uncertain that no one has any idea whatever, whether his conduct is within the ambient of the the statute, whether there is a zone of uncertainty around the statute, whether he could comply with the statute if he attempted to comply.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.522" offset="2601399">Concealability depends on a number of factors within the experience of most people.</text>

            <text syncTime="719.790" offset="2982473">Then too the standard under this statute is an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.354" offset="3004729">All of the factors we have suggested, the length of the weapon, the weight of the weapon, the bulkiness of the weapon depend on verifiable objective factors pertaining to the weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.164" offset="3047988">The statutes with which this Court has been concerned and has struck down for vagueness depend on subjective standards, such as the degree of annoyance caused by standard by conduct or the amount of harmed competitors caused by particular conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.501" offset="3117265">On the statutes meaning turns upon the effect of the conduct on third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.129" offset="3139834">It is often hard for someone even one who seeks to comply to assess that conduct in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.566" offset="3165539">He cannot know the ripples that his conduct will propagate among other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.714" offset="3182153">Not so here, the standard is objective, physical and turns on an analysis of the gun itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.819" offset="3226561">In fact, as I have suggested before, perhaps the proper construction of the statute is that all sort-of shotguns are within its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.054" offset="3255505">And as Mr. Justice White stated if the Court agrees with us on that submission then there is no problem of vagueness as applied or a vagueness on its face.</text>

            <text syncTime="1001.360" offset="4108768">The first of these, we have touched on earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.421" offset="4120994">And that is the argument that the shotgun in this case had a bulky stock would have caused a bulge under someone’s coat and therefore was not in fact conceivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.080" offset="4155580">That argument went to the Jury and the jury rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.362" offset="4164775">It is, we submit it, not a vagueness argument at all but simply a question of fact to be adjudicated on the the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.051" offset="4191524">Second argument is the argument that the statute could have been drawn with greater precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.076" offset="4211586">And therefore should have been drawn with greater precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.632" offset="4225797">This we think is an argument about legislative policy, the constitutional question is simply whether the words Congress used are devoid of meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.531" offset="4261428">If Congress uses words of clear purport in at least some cases, the fact that they could have been clearer still is immaterial for constitutional purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.189" offset="4304060">Third, respondent argues that there is some murky zone between large and therefore mailable sort-of shotguns and small and therefore non-mailable sort-of shotguns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.822" offset="4354633">And that respondent could not tell where in the zone of uncertainty her conduct fell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.646" offset="4377934">This is again not a vagueness argument by and large but an argument for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.778" offset="4398414">To the extent it is a vagueness argument at all</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.359" offset="4408759">It is an argument about vagueness as applied to particular weapons, it may well be that there are some sort-of shotguns that are so large that even though the jury concludes ultimately that they are capable of being concealed on the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.911" offset="4470930">That it was so uncertain cannot be properly culpable for her conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.625" offset="4501859">Now this Court has indicated that in most ordinary criminal statues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.773" offset="4526414">A person who approaches the zone of uncertainty, simply takes the risk, that he will cross the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.153" offset="4551910">That we submit is the proper resolution of the a vagueness as applied issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1189.886" offset="4862871">The problem the Court of Appeals found in this statute is whether the phrase capable of being concealed on the person is too vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.986" offset="4895263">The vagueness problem discerned by the Court of Appeals will exist in this case even if the statute said that pistols, revolvers, shotguns and other firearms capable of being concealed on the person shall be non mailable because respondents still could contend that her shotgun was not capable of being concealed on the person that the statute was vague as to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.654" offset="4981885">We think therefore that the argument that the statute does not specifically mention shotguns is simply not a vagueness argument within the posture of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.459" offset="5021173">In some, the only problem with the statute is whether the phrase capable of being concealed on the person is so devoid of meaning that it cannot ever carry with it a criminal punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.922" offset="5067044">We think that it can and that it can be construed to be even clearer by this Court, especially perhaps by reference to the Postal Service Regulations which have made it about as clear as can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.814" offset="5110617">We think this case is governed by what the Court wrote two terms ago in the letter carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.662" offset="5133918">There are limitations in the English language with respect to being both specific and manageably brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.581" offset="5157637">And it seems to us that although the prohibitions may not satisfy those intent upon finding fault at any cost, they are settled in terms that ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense, and sufficiently understand and comply with.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.167" offset="9859991">I think that if the Court, if this Court decided that there is a question or an issue of vagueness and there is a question of vagueness of the statute as applied to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.834" offset="9902623">To save that statute from its constitutional challenge of being vague that the Court may and in fact I think the Court must at least as I read Harris then interpret the statute so that it can avoid the vagueness issue and I think there is a little doubt that there must be some question as to the certainty of the statute, by the very fact that we have the Court of Appeals wondering and in fact ruling that the statute does not cover sort-of shotguns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.379" offset="10016830">I think in a similar case in Colorado, Cockley (ph) versus People, which is on Page 7 in my brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2502.033" offset="10111394">So I think there is a considerable question as to what application the statute has and I think that application issue goes to the issue of whether or not the language is certain enough to advise a man of common intelligence that the mailing of a sort-of shotgun of 22 and eighth inches is in fact in violation of the statute, especially if you look at the history of the statute in the first instance because I believe the history of the statute in the first instance was that it was to control the mailing of pistols and revolvers of handguns by mail-order people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.856" offset="10242737">I think clearly in that history, it refers to the Sears and Roebuck mailing of handguns and that the loss of the control of the states in a mail-order situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3035.666" offset="12246016">Based number one on its language, pistols and revolvers and other firearms capable of concealment on the person, I think that the statutory construction is that pistols and revolvers will modify the general language in the statute and the general language will be then presumed to be of the same class as to pistols and revolvers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.894" offset="12318845">Pistols and revolvers are in the class of handguns and it would seem to me that clearly under that theory of statutory construction, this is a statute to control the unlawful mailing of handguns, I think that the history of the statute and the congressional record --</text>

            <text syncTime="3112.325" offset="12552589">Well I think that the distinction between handgun and shoulder type weapons is not that it can -- all guns are fired with the hand or hands, can be hand or hands gun, but I think that the distinction is that a handgun characteristically can be fired with one hand away from the body where a shoulder type of weapon needs to rest against the body itself and whether the structure be the shoulder or the hip, it needs to rest against the shoulder or the hip and I think that is the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.955" offset="12667110">Not whether one uses a hand to manipulate the trigger because all guns are fired in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.867" offset="12686754">Pistols and revolvers first I think set up to class in terms of size and I think that they also setup the class in terms of characteristics.</text>

            <text syncTime="3154.438" offset="12721026">Between a handgun and a shoulder gun, that is the basic difference and a sort-of shotgun, once it is sort of is not a typical shoulder gun.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.149" offset="12807857">Again the question why it sort-of for ultimate purpose I do not think is one that we can give speculation to, I think the question is that in the argument, I am raising is that pistols and revolvers define not only the class and that handgun is oppose to shoulder but also define the size and that under either of those classes, this statute refers to pistols and revolvers and I think that it is not unreasonable and that men of common intelligence quite readily may assume that there are not pistols and revolvers of 22 and 1/8 inches, in with the barrel of ten inches and I think that they are not of a bulky nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.395" offset="12972847">So I would say that at this point it seems that and it is a construction argument in the sense that if the statute can be saved from its vagueness then it must be saved by construction but even further that construction argument points to the problem in the statute in terms of its certainty because from the construction, analysis of the statute, it does not apply to sort-of shotguns, it does not govern a weapon of that size or the kind of crime it was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.553" offset="13101474">And I would think that other firearms capable of being concealed is not anymore definable, it is symbolic language that has an outward reference point and that our reference point is not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.826" offset="13154659">I do not think it is anymore clearer than the current rate per diem in the Connally case so that I would say in conclusion then that this statute is unduly vague and that it can be saved, I believe by this Court from its vagueness challenge by construction limiting it to pistols and revolvers and pistols type weapons—</text>
