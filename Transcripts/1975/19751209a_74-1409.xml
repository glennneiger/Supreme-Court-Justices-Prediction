            <text syncTime="1912.230" offset="7752221">The position of the appellees today is that the Federal Constitution does not require that a defendant who is accused of a criminal misdemeanor charge for which the possible punishment is imprisonment that -that individual need not be tried by lawyer judge, that the Federal Constitution does not mandate that kind of requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.717" offset="7846157">Now the Tenth Amendment of our Federal Constitution, the States have the right to establish their own judicial system and the Commonwealth of Kentucky has adopted a judicial system that handles misdemeanor cases, minor criminal misdemeanor cases and in part that criminal misdemeanor system utilizes non lawyer judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.326" offset="7944587">We do not feel that the Tenth Amendment, in the Tenth Amendment there is any constitutional compulsion that a State adopt what might be considered an ideal system of the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.963" offset="7995160">That the fact that a judicial system has lawyer judges does not necessarily mean that they are good judges, whether that is a good system or that a judicial system that has non-lawyer judges means that that is a bad judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.373" offset="8060779">And the States, the State of Commonwealth of Kentucky has in part adopted a system, using non lawyer judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.534" offset="8105397">The issue in the case, in this case is not whether the judicial power was constitutionally exercised by Judge C. B Russell, it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.011" offset="8155343">But the issue is whether that judicial power was constitutionally vested and we believe that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.473" offset="8181152">We believe that judicial power maybe constitutionally placed with a non lawyer, well, in keeping with the requirements of Due Process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.366" offset="8220753">Court proceedings are held for the various solemn purpose of ascertaining the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.129" offset="8247816">That seems to be the very heart of a fair trial is the ascertainment of the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.889" offset="8274879">We readily agree that the Constitution and Due Process does require a fair trial in a fair tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.937" offset="8311032">This Court has considered several times what is necessary for there to be a fair tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.730" offset="8342275">The Court has said that the tribunal should be unbiased, that the tribunal should be neutral and detached Tome, Ward, Moore v. Demcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.420" offset="8385011">Each of these cases, there was something to taint the tribunal in terms of his biasness or his neutrality in considering the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.292" offset="8424508">But we believe that a non-lawyer can be unbiased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.054" offset="8439555">He can be neutral, and he can be detached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.920" offset="8455019">This unbiased, neutral and detached non-lawyer judge can give a defendant a genuinely fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.710" offset="8494099">It is a two part thing, fair trial in a fair tribunal and we do not feel that the non-lawyer Judge is prohibited by that status from being a fair tribunal and that status neither prevents him from affording one accused of a criminal misdemeanor a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.973" offset="8595245">A non-lawyer judge seems can look at a case, can look at a case in terms of ascertaining the truth against the standard that is required in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.453" offset="8641116">The burden of beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.169" offset="8655953">We believe that the non-lawyer judge can make independent judgments of the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.598" offset="8685733">There is no real probability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.579" offset="8693674">We feel that prejudice will result in a case that is handled by a non lawyer Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.642" offset="8725857">There is no nothing to show that non lawyer judges convict more frequently or reversed more on appeal or that they allow matters into evidence or otherwise handle a minor criminal misdemeanor case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.043" offset="11923454">We have first of all, the consideration that obviously as an outgrowth of that smallness, there is not going to be nearly the number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.783" offset="11958458">We have part time police court judges in the smaller cities whereas in the larger cities they would be a full time position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.515" offset="11985416">In a small city, being in rural parts of the state, the police court judges, they know the people in that small, and the prosecutions usually are not that vigorous and there are differences in handling of the cases in a smaller class of city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.051" offset="12071516">You also have just the very, very important factors still existing in Kentucky that we have counties in the Commonwealth Kentucky where there are few attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.649" offset="12117909">Maybe only one or two, or maybe only four or five existing in some 24 of our 120 counties, so we do have a problem that I think that you recognize in Argersinger, that we still have in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.295" offset="12188440">Although the situation in Argersinger and as far as the distribution of attorneys in the Commonwealth is quite different, we believe in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.591" offset="12229713">In Argersinger, the requirement of having an attorney for a criminal misdemeanor case, the fact that that attorney would come from a first class city and drive down the road 25 miles to a class of city maybe a fifth or sixth class city.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.202" offset="12292094">That was really very unimportant as long as that man helped the accused, present his defense but we are talking about here the fact that as our State has liked and we think the citizens of the Commonwealth want to have matters handled by one of their own by residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.239" offset="12368267">And we have residential requirement for police Court judges, so it is not the shuttling of an attorney from maybe where there are two many attorneys in Louisville Kentucky, for example, and to a small community such as I live in with 4000 people and less than 10,000 people in the entire country, Only fifty miles from Louisville.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.709" offset="12666167">And the new amendment to our Kentucky Constitution would say that each county is entitled to a District Court and in the county in which the District Court judge does not reside, he shall appoint a trial commissioner, that amendment goes on -- that section of the new amendment goes on further to say that if that the trial commissioner shall be an attorney, if one is available and qualified so again we are back to the same situation much as we find ourself before, that if every county is going to be required to have a District Court and there maybe as only one or two attorneys in the entire country.</text>
