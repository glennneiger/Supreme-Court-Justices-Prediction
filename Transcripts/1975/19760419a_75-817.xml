            <text syncTime="32.600" offset="234996">The basic question before the Court is whether it is permissible under the First Amendment for a Court to issue a direct prior restraint against the Press, prohibiting in advance a publication or reporting of information revealed in Public Court proceedings, Public Court records and from other sources about pendent judicial proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="77.358" offset="414091">This case as I said arose out multiple murders in Lincoln County in Nebraska back in October, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.467" offset="442513">The suspect, a man named Simants was arrested the following morning which was a Sunday and on Monday and Tuesday as would be normally expected, there are a number of stories, factual in nature appeared in the local media.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.460" offset="494444">They told about his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.328" offset="501967">They mentioned that the Lincoln County Attorney have said that Mr. Simants had made a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.732" offset="527567">The Lincoln County Attorney had said that he had a theory about the motive which would be brought out when the autopsy was completed and it was also reported that one person had said that Simants father had told him that Simants had told the father the he had committed the killings.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.501" offset="814601">On the Tuesday evening, the prosecutor, in advance of a preliminary hearing that was expected the next day, moved for a prior restraint in the County Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.236" offset="865592">No evidence was admitted to back it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.911" offset="880325">The County Court entered an order the following day in which he said that because of the reasonable likelihood of prejudicial news that would make it difficult, if not impossible to impanel an impartial jury, he was entering the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.910" offset="936331">It was a very broad order.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.754" offset="943646">It prohibited not only any evidence that would come forward at the preliminary hearing, but any evidence apart from the preliminary hearing except as would be allowed in certain voluntary Press-Bar Guidelines that were then in effect in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.627" offset="1011146">That order would have remained in effect even after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.777" offset="1031730">As a result of that order which the Press chose to obey, the Press could not report the following day what happened at the preliminary hearing, even though it was an open preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.974" offset="1072586">The public was there, the Press was there, anybody who wanted to be, could be there and could leave and go out and tell anybody he wanted to what had happened, but the Press was prohibited from reporting what had occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.978" offset="1136534">We are in a strange situation in regard to closed hearings there because you have a statute that says that it had to be open, but the Nebraska Supreme Court in this case seems to be interpreting in a way that seems to allow to have been closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.696" offset="1187420">Certainly the judge at the time thought that that hearing had to be open.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.179" offset="2197314">Because of that County Court, because of the trial was going to be in the District Court, the petitioners here went to the District Court and asked for him to strike the County Court order and the District Court entered its own order and its grounds was because of the nature of the crimes charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.387" offset="2262202">He said that there was a clear and present danger that the pretrial publicity could impinge on defendant’s right to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.149" offset="2289265">He also included those guidelines as part of his order, but he changed a number of items and said for example that we could not report the identity of persons sexually assaulted in connection with these murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.234" offset="2341615">That order would have remained in effect until after the jury was sworn.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.142" offset="2389262">Mr. Justice Blackmun entered an order granting in part and staying in part the District Court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.891" offset="2420191">He eliminated the guidelines as being too broad and vague and he did allow certain information to be published, but he also prohibited the publication of other items, including facts strongly implicated with the accused or facts highly prejudicial to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.676" offset="2491348">That order was then succeeded by the Fourth Order which is the one that is before you and that order is the one of the Nebraska Supreme Court entered on December 1, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.383" offset="2534189">It too, eliminated the guidelines, but it prohibited the publication of the existence or content of confessions or admissions against interest, made by the accused to law enforcement officers or the third parties except to the Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.063" offset="2604929">And it also prohibited, “other information strongly implicative of the accused as the perpetrator of the slain,” whatever that means and we are not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.729" offset="2655606">That applied interestingly only to petitioners and not to all the other media and it was effective only as to events which had occurred prior to the entry of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.537" offset="2702836">As a result of all four of these orders, the Press was prohibited from publishing information, most of it coming from public records and public hearings for over eleven weeks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1114.345" offset="4562023">Well, Your Honor, the difference between prior restraint and a contempt after the event has just been made so clear through all of your opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.181" offset="4613327">In the prior restraint, in the first place people tend to obey them, and therefore, it directly prohibits them doing of the event and in the second place, if he is going to be held for a contempt, he can contest the order itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.994" offset="4668602">He can even get a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.372" offset="4674140">He can contest the contempt order, but in a prior restraint, you cannot do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.109" offset="4697128">If their prior restraint is entered, you then must obey it under the laws it now stands until it is reversed on appeal and if you go in and try to attack the order, the only defense is that you did not violate it, but you cannot attack the order itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.441" offset="4754388">So there is a great difference between the two situations, certainly in terms of impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.927" offset="4780302">We say that the assumption that someone who hears about a case, even an alleged confession, the fact that he cannot be impartial or if he is partial, but he cannot be weeded out during the voir dire is simply unsupported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.523" offset="4842787">In fact, it is directly refuted by statutes in Nebraska and elsewhere which we have cited in our reply brief which allow jurors to sit, even if they have formed opinions of guilt from reading newspapers so long as the judge is satisfied that the juror is impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.891" offset="4928259">The courts have made it clear from United States versus Burr in 1807, all down through Irvin v. Dowd and Reynolds and Murphy versus Florida, that juror can give an impartial verdict even if he has some preconceived notion as to guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.604" offset="4995028">And if we need any examples of that, we certainly have them recently with Cali, Chapen, Mitchell, Connelly, Lily, all of whom stand as it seems to me irrefutable proof that even all pervasive publicity does not necessarily result in an unfair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.501" offset="5074650">We trust our juries in so many ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.587" offset="5083009">We sit there and tell them, look, do not listen to the confession given by your co-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.871" offset="5104116">It does not apply for you and we give them these instructions and we trust them and we expect them to do their job and yet Nebraska is not willing to concede that with proper voir dire and proper constructions that you cannot find 12 people who were going to give this man an impartial and fair verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.701" offset="5175482">There are ample ways, short of prior restraint to deal with adverse publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.343" offset="5193977">Sheppard, I counted, 12 of them in Sheppard and I do not need to go through them because you are certainly aware of them, but certainly two of them, change of venue and continuance, neither which were given here would obviously be what --</text>

            <label>Mr. Floyd Abrams</label>
            <text syncTime="1683.762" offset="6839691">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.194" offset="6849409">Mr. Prettyman represents as he has advised you, a large elements of the Nebraska Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.571" offset="6870934">I appear today on behalf of a variety of publishers, broadcasters and journalists from around the country to join with that Press and to urge upon you today a ruling which would be unthinkable in any nation in the world, except ours and unlikely in the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.911" offset="6940315">That it is in our view entirely consistent with American history makes it no less remarkable, but simply points to the remarkable nature of that history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.646" offset="6975215">For what we would asked of you is nothing less than a renunciation of power, a conclusion by this Court that the judiciary should not, indeed and may not, tell the Press in advance what news it may print, save only in that rare national security situation and that rare national security case adverted to by this Court in Near Versus Minnesota in the Pentagon papers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.761" offset="7071659">And what we urge upon you is that renunciation occurred over 200 years ago, that has been reaffirmed by this Court since its formation and that you should reaffirm it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.346" offset="7122023">Mr. Justice Stevens asked earlier whether the label prior restraint was important here and what the relevance of it is and I would like to devote the bulk of my remarks to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.384" offset="7166222">I would like to start historically because I think it is important to note that until very recently it was accepted by one and all that whatever else could be done to the Press with respect to pretrial publicity, the one thing that could not be done was any kind of prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.047" offset="7232782">20 years ago this month, if can be personal for a moment, I was on college debating team we used to talk about this subject and debate this subject full-time for a year and of all the remedies that people proposed to control what was then thought sometimes to be an irresponsible Press, no one even suggested in the scholarly works or in our debates the idea of prior restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.766" offset="7323688">So understood was it that while there could be some areas perhaps for contempt of Court after trials are over, that there could be no prior restraints in the area and we were not alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.161" offset="7373321">The cases supported us as they existed then, our briefs submitted on behalf of the amici curiae that I represent indicate that in our effort to survey all the cases in this area in American history, we come upon only five prior to the Sheppard Case in which there is any reports at all of any attempt to obtain a prior restraint against the Press and that each of those cases, it was easily and summarily reversed, they have of course in many cases since Sheppard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.976" offset="7492544">And while it is true that almost all of them had been reversed, all but one, two or three at the most, it is also true that prior restraints on the Press around the country are becoming a common place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.602" offset="7547087">Within the last year, New York has had its first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.785" offset="7563806">New Jersey has had its first and its second and Nebraska has had its first and second and third.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.454" offset="7594421">But I think it is a fair question to ask what is new or what has changed to lead to the start of a process by which prior restraints are now being issued in almost common place fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.862" offset="7656070">What I would urge on you, it is not that the Press has been more irresponsible by anyone’s judgment within the last few years than the years preceding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.979" offset="7692537">The days of the front page are over if they ever existed and even if Harry Hurst trial bore no resemblance to that of Sam Sheppard or Bruno Hauptmann.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.002" offset="7732661">It is not the guilty defendants are walking free on the streets because of the Press and because there is sometimes perhaps excessive pretrial publicity and it is not the innocent man, so far as we can tell, are in jail because of irresponsible Press coverage of trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.802" offset="7807894">And it is not, I would urged on you, that we now have reason to think that juries are less trustworthy than we ever thought they were and as Mr. Prettyman indicated, I can hardly think of a time in our history when juries have proved their metal in a more strong basis than they have it in the last few years nor is it the studies of scholars, of judges, of lawyers and a journalists have concluded within the last few years that anything had changed and that we should retreat from our abhorrence of prior restraint in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.664" offset="8007260">I will turn on that right now after just observing that there are five separate studies in these area by Bar Association Groups and the like and each of those conclude the prior restraints are constitutionally impermissible or unwise or the both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.387" offset="8078209">With respect to the post trial study, I would have a few comments to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.728" offset="8099525">First, it is really devoid, the record of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.943" offset="8116452">Mr. Prettyman in his brief urged upon you that if you care to take account of that post trial study that that petitioners before you should be permitted to put in a post-trial study of their own which is a poll taken by the North Platte newspaper of the jurors as to what they meant when the judge asked them those questions after the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.002" offset="8200671">I suspect you will not be interested in that poll, but I think it is first to rather unreliable study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.798" offset="8227838">I think the phraseology of the study is to say the least, slanted, and I am struck by the fact as Mr. Prettyman’s brief argues to you that one would believe jurors at the post trial moment when they are asked that question and not believe them when they are asked if they can give a fair trial in voir dire time prior to a trial beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.614" offset="8319058">It seems to me that a good part of what is involved in this in this case involves just that question of whether we can trust jurors or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.931" offset="8348419">As I have urged upon you, we think there is no time in our history when jurors have better indicated their ability to decide cases and to decide them without reliance on outside factors which might have been indicated and which others might have thought might have affected them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.915" offset="8408292">Now, we have urged on you the Sheppard Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.783" offset="8415815">We have urged it again and again and I just for you to decide whether our interpretation of Sheppard and our reading of Sheppard is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.158" offset="8445281">It is supported, we urge on you by Higher Courts in New York and California and by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.774" offset="8475793">And I can think one other reason apart from what I believe to be a misinterpretation by many Lower Courts of the Sheppard decision, for the amount of gag orders or restrictive orders that had been issuing in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.989" offset="8528560">I detect for what it maybe worth to you, a profound and growing sense of judicial concern that what is sometimes is viewed to be your responsibility on the part of the Press and its coverage of Courts and of other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.318" offset="8577879">I have been confronted when I have argued before other Courts than this with a number of questions relating to just those matters, relating essentially to matters of responsibility and I could do no more with respect to that and to urge on you the language in the CBS case of the Chief Justice for the majority of the Court that the risks of abuse of the First Amendment are well known to the framers who accepted the reality that risks of those of abuse or evils of which there was no acceptable remedy other than the spirit of moderation and a sense of responsibility and civility on the part of those who exercise the guaranteed freedoms of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.642" offset="8723224">I wish to be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.612" offset="8727090">We maybe back someday, I suspect, some of us will, representing clients or some of our brethren representing clients will be back urging on you the proposition that a power to hold the Press in contempt is very narrow, that the power to punish the Press for what it prints is narrower still.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.589" offset="8802950">But historically, the power to ban the Press in advance, from deciding what to print, is narrowest still and that is this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2214.396" offset="8962193">One is in this reading as we view it of the Sheppard case by Lower Courts around the country and the second is what I described as what I view at least or what I see at least, as the continuing sense of judicial concern of the nature of the reporting which occurs with respect to the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.918" offset="9036276">Those are the two things that I think it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.547" offset="9046829">It is also I think, and we have urged upon you in our amici brief on this reading of those cases of this Court which deal with the heavy burden on prior restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.668" offset="9095313">I did not understand the concept of heavy burden on prior restraints to be an invitation to enter prior restraints when on some basis or another it was thought useful to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.284" offset="9137735">We believe that the nature of the prior restraint idea is set forth in the Southeastern Productions Case of Justice Blackmun and that you must take into account in deciding whether they can be prior restraints at all, whether historically, there has been a category established here of prior restraints which are acceptable in this area and an exception to what the Court in Southeastern Production refer to as the prohibition against prior restraints.</text>

            <text syncTime="2325.826" offset="9407946">I would close with this observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.650" offset="9415260">We well appreciate that there are cases which this Court must sit as a drawer of very hard to draw lines on an ad hoc basis on a case-to-case basis and there are of course areas in which it may properly be set as Justice Holmes did, “that the power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2376.905" offset="9612224">I am representing the Honorable Hugh Stuart, Judge of the Lincoln County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.355" offset="9634062">Mr. Milton Larson, a Lincoln County Attorney is also with me here today and we will argue a certain aspects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.295" offset="9677843">Let me, if I may, take this case from the top. 8:00 p.m., October 18th 1975, KNOP, the only television station in North Platte began transmitting the NBC Saturday night movie, The Deadly Tower, a dramatization of the 1966 massacre of 16 persons and the wounding of 31 others by a sniper atop the tower, the University of Texas in Austin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.148" offset="9817233">By an uncanny coincidence, the movie provided the electric background for another broadcast mass murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.332" offset="9854013">About 18 minutes into the movie, a KNOP newsman answered a telephone call from the sheriffs’ office which requested the television station to put a warning on the area that there had been killing at nearby Sutherland, Nebraska and that everyone should lock their doors and windows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.941" offset="9920364">The case at bar was born.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.089" offset="9933007">It is, therefore, proper that certain events be reviewed and placed in the proper perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.584" offset="9962996">The town of Sutherland is located in Western Nebraska between the North and South Platte Rivers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2474.707" offset="10003433">The town of Sutherland had a 1970 population of approximately 800 persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.129" offset="10029138">The population today is somewhat larger due to a number of transient workers who are employed in the construction of a huge electrical generating facility nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.968" offset="10080547">Following the television announcement, law enforcement officers in the Sutherland area continued their investigation of the crime and early the next morning, on a tip by a reliable informer, they arrested the respondent Erwin Charles Simants near the scene of the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2669.980" offset="10784599">The statement on page five of the brief of the petitioners is that “On October 20, a Lincoln County Attorney told the Press that Simants have given authorities a statement,” exemplifies the need, in case such as this, for the trial courts to be able to restrict the media in certain cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.778" offset="10867773">Specifically the quote on page five of the petitioner’s brief refers to read at page 88 of the joint appendix and there sure enough, there is a copy of a newspaper and a quote “Lincoln County Attorney Milton Larson, said Monday, that Simants has given authorities his statement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.802" offset="10935900">Putting aside for a moment how the reputation of a quotation such as that could influence a community where a jury will ultimately be chosen, is the naked fact that the statement is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.754" offset="10995668">Indeed the writer who is the Bureau Chief of one of one the nation's largest wire services has now admitted that hearsay of an eminent's driver's husband was falsely attributed to the County Attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="3516.902" offset="14172263">Your Honor, there are though of several issues and I would like to address myself to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.865" offset="14200057">First, is the first very basic issue and that is whether or not the Courts had a power and under in what circumstances to enter a valid protective order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.528" offset="14234748">The answer seems to me unequivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.589" offset="14243002">The Courts do have the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.807" offset="14251884">A few basic consideration seems to me make this conclusion absolutely necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.295" offset="14273827">One, fair administration of justice is one of the most essential functions of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.476" offset="14294516">Every other with other right including the right of a free Press may well depend upon ability to get a judicial hearing that is dispassionate and as an impartial as a weakness inherent men will permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.593" offset="14342999">Two, the media has the power, whether lawful or not, to destroy the right to a fair trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.106" offset="14369121">Not only does it have this power, but it has been exercised as demonstrated in the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.904" offset="14396289">Three, no Government can long endure if it can permit private persons or persons to prevent the discharge of one of its essential functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.471" offset="14434532">The Press has taken a position that the Courts have no power, save national security, to issue restrictive orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.876" offset="14460132">That position I submit to you finds no support whatever in the constitution in the United States nor does it find any support in the teachings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.823" offset="14499943">Two dangerous impressions moreover are alleged in the position that the petitioners have taken in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.422" offset="14522304">One, is it that the press is above the law, and the other is that the people in the Government are antagonistic, that the press must somehow protect the people from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.592" offset="14558979">I submit to you that these impressions are based upon some misconceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.603" offset="14579041">A fundamental principle of American law and from Anglo-American law for at least 700 years is that no one is above the law and certainly, neither the constitution nor the people are conferred upon private corporations, whether engaged in a publishing or the broadcasting business or any other business, a status that not even of the President of the United States can claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.789" offset="14667753">All are under the law and none has the right in its sole discretion to prevent the judicial branch or any other branch of the Government in carrying out its assigned functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.764" offset="14707668">Secondly, America’s greatest claim to freedom, to its place and history is its Government other people, by the people and for the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.542" offset="14750823">Is that the Government who is at the control of the people, the people want and they need the news media to assist them in this process, but only under the law and not above it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.574" offset="14802963">Freedom of the Press simply is not absolute and absolute discretion is granted to no one under the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.367" offset="14838072">Ours is the Government of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.614" offset="14847058">It is not a Government of men.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.623" offset="14863149">Thus it cannot seriously be doubted that the Courts have the power to render valid protective orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.732" offset="14883525">That critical issue is under what circumstances can a restrictive order be entered and what should be its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.972" offset="14908498">The issue here is delicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.830" offset="14915917">It is a delicate balancing of interest between the First and Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.665" offset="14931277">This is where the Courts and media must give careful consideration to the important functions that media performs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.602" offset="14959071">Perhaps a good place to start is the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.393" offset="14970251">This is a likely source of most Restrictive Orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.794" offset="14983835">As I have previously alluded to you under Nebraska Law, one who believes he had been unjustly charged with a criminal offense has a right for a prompt preliminary hearing before a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.137" offset="15025213">In that particular hearing, the Government does have the burden proving one, whether or not a crime has been committed and two whether or not a person charged committed the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.574" offset="15078921">The dissemination of public information at that stage of the trial can in appropriate case create habit in providing a defendant with a fair trial because frequently at such hearings there is testimony relating to confessions, and I call your attention to several empirical studies, empirical studies which are cited on pages 10 and 11 of the brief for the respondent Stuart, which demonstrate how, the publication of a confession or the fact that one has been given can in a particular case deny that criminal defendant a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.697" offset="15255404">In the case of Estes versus Texas this Court itself had that the pretrial can create a major problem for the defendant in criminal case. Indeed, the Court went on to state a pretrial publicity may be more harmful than publicity during the trial for it may well set the community opinion as to guilt or innocence.</text>

            <text syncTime="4218.366" offset="16978127">I am the prosecutor in this action and I am here representing the State of Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="4225.659" offset="17007280">I believe that, insofar as the factual background, Mr. Mosher has done a very good job in laying forth the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.222" offset="17045523">The one thing that he did not mention in terms of whether the state may have overreacted to some publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.816" offset="17087946">I was called to Sutherland on the evening of October 18th, assisted in the criminal investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.723" offset="17119502">The bodies were in the house from approximately 10 o’clock when I got there until 4:30 the next morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.773" offset="17143744">Everything left just as it was for the purpose of getting the criminal investigation underway and completed and before the bodies were removed, there was an NBC helicopter from Denver that had arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.018" offset="17204766">There were news, media representatives from the Wire Services, AP, UPI, Omaha World-Herald, all of the local radio stations, television.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.681" offset="17255339">It was very apparent, very early that I was going to be faced with a good deal of publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.097" offset="17288984">In this regard, I would like to narrow the issues here a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.776" offset="17315734">I think that we need to say that we are talking here only about the very exceptional case in the criminal arena, unfortunately the sensational case, the highly publicized case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.943" offset="17364426">However, we are also talking therefore about the major cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.168" offset="17377278">The ones that the public presumably the going to be the most interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.814" offset="17395877">Certainly this case, involving the mass murder of six people, involving sexual assaults on children and an elderly woman both before and after death must fall within the realm of an exceptional case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.897" offset="17460243">You have to couple that, unlike the Watergate situations that happened in a metropolitan area where everyone is not terribly concerned about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.573" offset="17514891">Here we have a situation in a town of 800 where virtually everyone knows everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.519" offset="17538715">The people in the community knew both the accused and all of the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="4364.147" offset="17561285">They were very vitally interested in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.891" offset="17572256">They were going to learn all that they could and rightfully so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.038" offset="17592841">They would want to learn all that they could, but that adds to the prosecutions’ burden of protecting the individual’s right to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.814" offset="17631920">I do not mean to sound as a defense attorney, but as an officer of the Court, I felt that it was the burden of the prosecution as well and I think that is clearly indicated in Sheppard to take reasonable steps as I felt were necessary to protect the individual’s right to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.650" offset="17715198">I do also wish to reemphasize the fact that I did not, at any time state that the defendant had made a statement and I am very happy to report that because it would have been highly embarrassing had I done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.185" offset="17773399">I was misquoted on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.036" offset="17784788">Then with regard to the pervasiveness of the County Court's Order, he simply said, you shall not report what happened at the preliminary hearing, except as in compliance to the Bar Press Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.235" offset="17833585">You have to take that into account in terms of the circumstances there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.794" offset="17855841">Nebraska has a statute requiring that if a man is held without bond that he shall be entitled to a preliminary hearing within four days.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.156" offset="17885308">That is not very much time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.257" offset="17893667">By the time we got even organized, I have a four-man staff, by the time I even got organized to consider the procedural problems of Due Process and fair trial and the Sixth Amendment, it was Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.590" offset="17951032">I had to have the preliminary hearing Tuesday, and so I asked, I simply put a motion on and said, Your Honor, I just request that the order -- that the Court enter whatever order it deems necessary to protect this individual’s right to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.977" offset="18016547">And the judge looked at it and he said, my gosh, I see the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.196" offset="18037445">In the meantime, I have received calls from the Chicago Tribune, LA Sun-Times, The London Sunday-Times, NBC, ABC, everyone and I was very much appalled that what was going to transpire.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.766" offset="18111737">So the judge said, obviously, this needs to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.385" offset="18134202">Obviously, I have not much time, call of the media that are here and that are represented, asked them to come to the Court this evening and we are going to talk this over and he came in, he ultimately decided that he was not going to be able to make any extensive study of the law in the area and he said, you are going to be able to get a review from the District Court and I am just going to shut it down and you can get your review there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.947" offset="18244439">The following morning, we had our preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.872" offset="18260113">The following evening, we had a hearing as to the -- we had a review of the County Court's Order and the District Judge also said, this order is over broad, but I do not know how over broad it is because I am not right up-to-date on everything with regard to free-Press and fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.718" offset="18347466">So I want to postpone this matter until October 27th, that was four days, request that counsel give me some guidelines, give me their thoughts as to what ought to go into the order and if they ought not to be in order, what those -- the basis for that is and on October 27th, he modified the order which was five days after the original order had been entered and I think under the circumstances he got it on Wednesday, gave Thursday and Friday for the people to get -- the people involved to get their information together as to what they want to put before the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.124" offset="18509112">Then on October 27th, at which he entered his order and the heard arguments as to its validity and what ought to be in it, and what ought not to be in it and decided to go with the Bar-Press Guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.044" offset="18560834">And Justice Blackmun, I think correctly stated, that they are over broad because they are not specific enough in all areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.531" offset="18586748">If you are going to be charged with contempt you certainly ought to know what you are being charged with and I could not agree more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.597" offset="18610989">I think that is absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.222" offset="18621543">So, it was limited to confessions, confessions made to law enforcement people, confessions made to others, and to those facts strongly implicative of this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.214" offset="18681520">Now, Justice Stevens question is that would on its face appear to be rather pervasive, but I would submit that it is not when applied to the facts to the case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.207" offset="18733451">Basically, at the time of the preliminary hearing all we have was the confession of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.644" offset="18759260">All of the physical evidence that was to later corroborate the confession, the fibers that were found from his coat, that were found on the bodies of the defendants and etcetera, this was all being packaged and being sent to the FBI Laboratory in Washington D.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.075" offset="18824984">We had nothing at the time of the preliminary hearing to secure a probable cause for the bind over of this defendant, except, nothing exculpatory except his confession which is sufficient for establishing probable cause, to bind him over.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.362" offset="18910144">But with regard to the questions that are involved here, I think what comes into conflict are the two rules of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.745" offset="18959672">One that that which transpires in the open courtroom is maybe published with impunity and two, that where there is a reasonable likelihood of prejudicial news coverage that the judge shall take those steps as are required to protect the right to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.573" offset="19038979">Clearly, none of the cases have indicated that there is any indication toward prior restraint that that it is all desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.076" offset="19068968">That I submit in exceptional cases where locale and circumstance combine such that pervasive publicity, extensive publicity and prejudicial publicity would or create a clear and present danger to the impaneling of a fair and impartial jury that that must necessarily that the judge must necessarily have the authority to enter any appropriate order.</text>

            <text syncTime="4871.567" offset="19590895">In regard to the confession itself, I would submit to the Court that a confession, in an exceptional case, such as we have before us uniquely lends itself to a restriction in the pretrial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.703" offset="19659440">I think it is also important to remember that we are talking about pretrial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.956" offset="19676472">I cannot conceive of any basis during the trial of precluding publicity because obviously the jury can be sequestered at that time, they do not need to have access to that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.898" offset="19732269">But we are talking about pretrial and we do not know who the perspective jurors are going to be and we do know though what type of information they are going to have at their disposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.742" offset="19775633">I would submit, Your Honors that in light of the four-day requirement, in light of the fact of necessity had to introduce the confession at the preliminary hearing in order to get a bind over, that it can be hardly said as petitioners would have believe that we volunteered that information for dissemination to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.786" offset="19855776">As a matter of prosecution, as a matter of getting my job done, there was no -- I had no alternative, but to introduce confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="4952.382" offset="19914186">No, Your Honor, that was the next point that I was going to make, Due Process before the admission of a confession, into the trial portion, requires a due process hearing outside the presence of the jury with relationship to voluntariness, that was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.291" offset="19985761">But I would submit to you that that would be a very little moment if the confession had already been published and the jurors already have knowledge of it, because I would submit that what would go up to the mind of the juror, if they went to the trial and no confession was introduced, was not that there must not have been a confession, but rather that, well, that prosecutor did not introduce said confession, but I know it was made and I think that type of prejudice simply cannot be over come.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.468" offset="20106552">And I think that the issue, the basic issue here is that in the exceptional case who shall govern, who shall have ultimate authority to protect the due process requirements with relationship to a fair trial. Shall it be, the Courts, shall it be the judiciary or shall it be the editor?</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.927" offset="20200384">I would submit that before public dissemination of information relative to the existence of a confession can be or should be disseminated that the question of voluntariness should first be determined, in the first instance by the judiciary, not by editorial comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.074" offset="20276975">And that again, I am talking about exceptional cases, highly publicized issues, I am talking about this case gentleman, where in a small rural community we had a mass murder of a scope that was unprecedented in Nebraska since the Starkweather case in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.480" offset="20366522">It would seem to me that if ever there was a situation where there could be a limited prior restraint, and again we must say limited, I feel that as I think it clearly the law, it can be no more pervasive and it is absolutely necessary to insure the judicial process and the orderly administration of justice and that is really what we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.291" offset="20461817">Is the ultimate power of the Courts to control their own processes to insure that due process of the law is met.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.933" offset="20492328">I think that we should talk about the Estes case, the Rideau case, the Sheppard case which indicate that due process, that actual prejudice need not be shown where a due process demands a reversal because of prejudicial publicity.</text>

            <text syncTime="5298.396" offset="21298258">Well, of course, we would contend and the Nebraska Supreme Court does not agree with us that the Press is entitled to intervene here, that it represents not only its own rights, but the public's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.512" offset="21346741">One very strange aspect to this case is that the Nebraska Supreme Court said, we never should have been allowed to intervene in the first place, and that therefore, we could have disobeyed the County Court order with impunity even though it was entered against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5323.973" offset="21400553">Now, you got a strange situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5335.264" offset="21445693">Defendants as a matter of course are going to ask for a prior restraint, both to prevent themselves from being charged of in effective assistance to the counsel and also because it is obviously in their client's interest not to have any publicity about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.610" offset="21499087">So that is going to become the normal thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5353.805" offset="21519881">Let us do not take a chance on reversal later, disagree to it and suddenly you are sitting there with a judge, with both of parties agreeing on something, pushing it toward it, you do not have the Press present in Nebraska, because they do not have a right to intervene, and so the judge naturally who also does not want to be reversed is going to grant it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5490.532" offset="22066780">Let us say for example that on the morning of an election, a Congressman is indicted and confesses and an unconstitutional order, constitutional or not is entered immediately against the Press, but it stays into effect only until 7 o’clock that night.</text>

            <text syncTime="5539.446" offset="22262385">The public's right immediately to news, because you cannot judge the impact that news is going to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.739" offset="22295613">In the Joan Little case for example, the fact that the women’s rights were immediately able, right immediately able to generalize, get support for her, was extremely important and in the Schulingkamp case, the immediate putting out of the news resulted in the whole juvenile system being redone and all of that could have been lost if there had been a delay.</text>
