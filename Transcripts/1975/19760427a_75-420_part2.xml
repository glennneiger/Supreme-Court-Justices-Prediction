            <text syncTime="7.976" offset="135248">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.828" offset="154683">When we concluded last evening, it had been established that Section 15(a)(2) is gone, it is no long -- Congress has made it no longer applicable to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.176" offset="216019">And you will recall that that was the Section, that was the source upon which the Government and the Commission relied for there source of implied power.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.294" offset="268473">So it appears that the appellants in terms of statutes had nowhere else to go because the new rule of rate making expressed in new Section 15(a)(4) makes it clearer than ever that the rate making power cannot be expanded by implication in to the power to impose conditions controlling the use of Carriers’ revenues.</text>

          <turn speaker="doyle_s_morris" startTime="85.783" stopTime="305.283">
            <label>Mr. Doyle S. Morris</label>
            <text syncTime="85.783" offset="446419">I take it they do not but I respectfully submit that any reading, just a casual reading of new 15(a)2 for which appears at page 2 of our supplemental brief establishes once and for all, that the Congress has imposed upon the Commission an affirmative duty to establish revenue levels for the Carriers which will among other things cover “total operating expenses”.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.579" offset="581629">And if I may be permitted to give Your Honors a couple of examples that will readily illustrate how the claim power cannot be implied from this new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.748" offset="634292">At appendix 467 and 473, you will find the cases that the DTNI, the DTNI is at 467, the Utah Railway is at 473, each of these Carriers applied under their Commissions 305 orders for permission to use these revenues for operating expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.910" offset="730945">And what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="158.585" offset="737632">They were turned down.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.846" offset="750693">Now the Milwaukee case tells us even more.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.957" offset="767203">The Milwaukee case appears at page 477.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.866" offset="786742">The Milwaukee was desperately had put for cash and it applied to the Commission under its order for permission to use these funds for operating expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.016" offset="843376">After two months of deliberation, the Commission finally grudgingly agreed to give such consent but upon conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.988" offset="887261">So at once we see further new conditions superimposed upon the conditions that are here challenged at Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.462" offset="925191">And what were these two new superimposed conditions?</text>
            <text syncTime="209.904" offset="942955">One, that the Milwaukee’s transfer from its Account 716, that is Special Reserve Fund that the Commission had decreed to its other pocket in Account 701 cash that had to be regarded if you please as I quote “borrowing” and such borrowing could endure subject to the Commission and had to be repaid upon the Commission’s further order.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.610" offset="1061759">And the second condition was while this borrowing was outstanding, the Milwaukee could not be permitted to transfer any assets of any kind to its parent company or to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries without the Commission's permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.663" offset="1145978">Now, in imposing this second condition, the Commission was exercising a power that the Congress of the United States has steadfastly refused to grant it over a period of a decade, for more than a decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.773" offset="1206373">The Commission has been up on the hill trying to sell a Bill that would give it jurisdiction over it just as very tight of inter-company transactions and the Congress in a full decade has not even given them a hearing on that Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.006" offset="1271366">So this illustrates what can happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.115" offset="1283800">It illustrates that unlawful, unauthorized action breeds upon itself and leads to further unauthorized actions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="305.283" stopTime="313.983">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="305.283" offset="1324447">I suppose that the Congress thought the particular Amendment was not necessary that might also explain not having any action to do.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="doyle_s_morris" startTime="313.983" stopTime="322.142">
            <label>Mr. Doyle S. Morris</label>
            <text syncTime="313.983" offset="1359242">Very much so, certainly Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.247" offset="1372303">And we agree entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.239" offset="1384319">But the point I should like to make is—</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="322.142" stopTime="327.603">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="322.142" offset="1391947">The Commission might respond to that by saying that they have the power already and they were just trying to confirm it.</text>

          <turn speaker="doyle_s_morris" startTime="327.603" stopTime="366.366">
            <label>Mr. Doyle S. Morris</label>
            <text syncTime="327.603" offset="1413786">Their representations to the Congress were quite to the contrary, they have made extensive representations which they say, they do not have any power whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.421" offset="1452969">We cite them in our brief, to control or prohibit or deny inter-corporate transactions over the payment of dividends, transfer of assets, what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.649" offset="1497900">And they claim that this is a serious problem that they ought to have be given jurisdiction to say, yes, you may make such a transfer, no, you may not, it should be rescinded etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.379" offset="1548891">Extensive jurisdiction over such transfers and the Congress has not accorded it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="366.366" stopTime="374.910">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="366.366" offset="1568744">Did the Commission in this presentations relate that to some of the disasters that have occurred in the carrier field.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="doyle_s_morris" startTime="374.910" stopTime="575.034">
            <label>Mr. Doyle S. Morris</label>
            <text syncTime="374.910" offset="1603017">They have.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.683" offset="1606047">They have related it to the well-known disaster of the Penn Central and it is interesting to find that --- among expert bodies who have studied this subject including the Commission's own staff, there is no conclusive evidence that the fact that the Penn Central had a conglomerate structure as such, had any bearing whatever upon its going bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.114" offset="1719732">But this is a type of thing that the Commission has been asserting in support of the Bill that has been lobbying for a decade and not having been given a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.105" offset="1759751">But nonetheless, in this proceeding they exercised that power that has been denied them by the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.190" offset="1792039">It illustrates simply this your Honors, that under a statute such as new 15a(4) which imposes an affirmative duty to establish a revenue levels that will cover total operating expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.895" offset="1850866">One simply cannot imply a power from that kind of a statute that would give the Commission the right to withhold revenues from the coverage of operating expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.865" offset="1898827">The two propositions go manifestly 180 degrees in the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.294" offset="1924532">Thus, we find that the Congress has drawn a bright line of distinction between the rate making power, the power to establish revenue levels on the one hand and power to dictate the use and control the use of the revenues on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.458" offset="2009168">The latter has been, we respectfully submit, denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.807" offset="2030589">Well, where does the Commission go from there?</text>
            <text syncTime="486.215" offset="2048143">No statute to rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.095" offset="2059741">All we hear is the presentation, the Railroads made “promises” may ought to be held to their promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.369" offset="2100806">Yesterday, I reviewed the facts that there were no such promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.126" offset="2123794">That in addition to the deferred maintenance and delayed capital improvements that applicants presented a broad array of facts in support of their rate increase case.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.679" offset="2170083">The point, I suggest to you gentlemen is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.869" offset="2186801">Even if it were true, assuming arguendo that the Carrier's entire case in support of their Ex parte 305 request for a rate increase had rested on their claim need for “deferred maintenance” and “delayed capital improvements” even as narrowly defined later on by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.080" offset="2291604">Still the fact would remain that private parties cannot confer jurisdiction on the Commission which the Congress of the United States has denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.856" offset="2338729">We rely on the fundamental maxim that jurisdiction cannot be created by consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.024" offset="2367464">It is for the Congress to state the Commission’s powers and not for the Carriers to confer any power whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.348" offset="2400692">So --</text>

            <text syncTime="731.353" offset="3028780">The entire industry of course had an extremely depressed earnings level in the Eastern part of the United States for the year 1973 when the Carriers had their most tremendous volume of business ever, the rate of return on that investment in the Eastern District was just a little over one-half of one percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.730" offset="3122298">And with the increase it would become still less than three percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.952" offset="3147167">That was the need.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.815" offset="3150615">And the Commission found, if you please, the Commission found that the Carriers needed the revenues and without the increase the Carriers would not have sufficient revenues to provide the country with adequate services as required by the Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.077" offset="3219683">But not withstanding that finding which was a paraphrase of the then controlling statute, the Commission nonetheless determine to embark upon a revolutionary step to control the use of the revenues.</text>

All the Commission has got left to talk about is the National Transportation Policy and the teaching of this Court’s decision in Arrow Transportation, 372 U.

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="1059.337" offset="4340649">I just have four brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.458" offset="4349113">The first one is an informational one to a question Justice Stevens put to me yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.162" offset="4371996">On advise that the supervision of the safety aspects of Railroads has been transferred to the Department of Transportation in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.975" offset="4411180">And that the authority that the Commission previously had at that time is now used and performed by the Department of Transportation but the same safety regulation factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.457" offset="4461126">Mr. Morris has said that the Commission for ten years has been seeking from the Congress, the authority, which it now purports to exercise as we pointed out in our reply brief what the Commission was seeking from Congress, was something very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.565" offset="4521626">The Commission was seeking authority to prevent Railroads from diverting their Railroad assets into non-transportation activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.756" offset="4558301">That is what they were talking about in connection with the Penn Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.573" offset="4569586">That the Penn Central allegedly had been using a lot of railroad revenues and railroad properties for non-transportation purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.724" offset="4598217">That is a very different thing from what the Commission is doing in this case which is to try to ensure that the Railroads use the Transportation Revenues for the purposes for which they say it is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.355" offset="4656731">Now, Mr. Morris has said that the new statute denies the Commission, its authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.751" offset="4686301">We emphatically and vigorously deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.493" offset="4705319">I would like to apart from the language which we have briefly referred to of the statute which we think if anything manifests even clear intention that Congress intended the Commission to have the responsibility to ensure that the Railroads are operating efficiently and of course ensuring that necessary deferred maintenance is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.054" offset="4791523">There is one way to ensure that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.617" offset="4797792">But there are two very specific things with respect to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.864" offset="4810749">The first is set forth in the Senate Committee report, which is quoted in a lengthy footnote at pages 17 to 18 of our brief, footnote number 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.656" offset="4861949">And the first full paragraph in the footnote on page 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.346" offset="4880757">And I just quote that says, it refers to a study made by the National City Bank – First National City Bank of the Railroads problem said, the figures as to the amount of deferred maintenance in the Nations Rail Industry compiled by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its proceeding ex parte 305, this very proceeding substantially comport with the 5.7 Billion found by FNCB in its study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.225" offset="4984202">In other words, Congress recognized in enacting this statute that the Railroads had a very serious problem in connection with deferred maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.325" offset="5020669">And along with that, there is a provision of the new statute which is Section 504 which is contained in Public Law 94, Section –</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.829" offset="5098618">It is Public Law 94-210, Section 504(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.108" offset="5123800">And its page 40 of this little printed version of the Act that is around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.208" offset="5148146">And that provision expressly directs the Railroads within 18 months, after the enactment of this statute to report to the Secretary of Transportation or Class One Railroads, the total deferred maintenance and the purpose of that is to enable the Secretary to allocate from the fund that has been created announced that will help the Railroads in claiming up this deferred maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.728" offset="5250233">Now its seems to us incredible to believe that at the same time that the Congress was attempting to strengthen the statute to enable the Commission to deal more effectively with the problems of the Railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.673" offset="5302060">And it recognized the vast amounts of deferred maintenance and also took steps to ensure that the Secretary of Transportation would be able to channel funds for that purpose by requiring the Railroads to report the amounts of deferred maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.603" offset="5361723">That at the same time it would have cut off the Commissions power when the Railroads told them they needed the money for deferred maintenance that Congress could have said, no, you cannot do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.451" offset="5409162">That just seems to us impossible to believe that that is what it was intended and I stress the whole question here is the question of the Commission's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.270" offset="5440404">Whether or not the Chessie did or did not have deferred maintenance is not the issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.449" offset="5465168">As I previously mentioned yesterday, the District Court recognized that Chessie needed additional maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.737" offset="5486275">The sole question is the question of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.207" offset="5496202">And we submit that the Commission most certainly has the power when the Railroads and all the Railroads tell it, it needs this money for deferred maintenance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1990.338" offset="8064666">I believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.440" offset="8069054">I would have to check the dates on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.928" offset="8079085">They are all – the orders are all set out in the – I think since the date that the Temporary Restraint -- certainly since the date of the Temporary Restraining Order because after the Temporary Restraining Order the Commission issued its last order in October and the Chessie then amended its complaint to include that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.312" offset="8152541">And in that order the Commissions gave the instances in which it had granted or denied these exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.486" offset="8181276">So the order will staid I would say with respect to the Chessie prior to the time that Commission had finished the case.</text>
