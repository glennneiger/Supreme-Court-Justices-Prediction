            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="39.659" offset="261976">Mr. Chief Justice may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.922" offset="275037">This case is here on the Government's petition for Certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.239" offset="304294">It involves the interpretation of 31 U.S.C. 191 which provides that when a person indebted to the United States becomes insolvent, the debts due to the United States shall be paid first.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.811" offset="358524">The issue here is whether that priority of the United States, applies only when the precise amount of the debt is established before insolvency or whether all debts due to the United States since insolvency, whether liquidated or not, are to be paid first.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.337" offset="428637">The fact here were stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.563" offset="437518">Emsco which is a Texas Corporation breached three contracts with the Defense Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.589" offset="461656">After they had breached the contracts, it assigned all its property to respondent to be sold for the benefit of its creditors and that act of course established its insolvency.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.790" offset="510452">Shortly thereafter, the Government re-let those contracts that Emsco had breached and the amount of Emsco’s debt to the Government was determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.137" offset="547860">It was determined by settlement of two of the contracts and by charging Emsco for the excess costs of re-procurement on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.502" offset="589342">The priority statute requires that when a person indebted to the Government becomes insolvent, the debts to the United States shall be paid first.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.176" offset="624033">And a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors is the one of the ways in which insolvency can be shown under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.256" offset="656320">It is -- that is also an act of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.563" offset="669590">So that when there is an assignment for the benefit of creditors, the creditors have a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.209" offset="696131">They can either consent to the assignment and take their share of the debtor's estate under the conditions in the assignment or if they prefer the protection of Bankruptcy Laws, they can petition to have the debtor declared a bankrupt, in which case the assignment is void.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.474" offset="777215">If there had been a petition in bankruptcy here, it is clear that the Government's claims on this contract would have been debts provable in bankruptcy because the Bankruptcy Act expressly defines debts to include un-liquidated or even contingent claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.239" offset="848268">These are provable debts and so long as they are liquidated or can be estimated soon enough, so that they can paid without unduly delaying the Administration of the estate, they are allowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.479" offset="937189">In addition, the bankruptcy Act gives a priority to debts owing to any person, including the United States entitled to a priority under Federal Law, so that the Bankruptcy Act incorporates the priority statute by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.025" offset="1007406">A number of cases, both in this Court and in the Courts of Appeals have assumed that this priority applies to claims like the ones here which were un-liquidated when insolvency occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.940" offset="1067069">So that if there had been a bankruptcy, we submit that these claims would not only have been provable, but would been entitled to a priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.509" offset="1105313">But there was not any petition in bankruptcy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.511" offset="1117329">The Government simply asserted its claims to priority under the priority statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.180" offset="1136033">When the claim was denied, the Government brought suit in the District Court following the established principle, found that the Government was indeed entitled to its priority, but the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.826" offset="1198622">It interpreted, it is a 175 year old statute without considering any of the previous cases which it had construed, the policy it was designed to serve or even the long-standing practice under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.306" offset="1256509">The Court held that before its debts due means only those debts which would have been entitled to be recovered under Common Law Action of Debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.640" offset="1309904">Since the claims here were not for fixed and certain amounts presently payable at insolvency, they were not debts due at Common Law, and therefore, the Court held they were not entitled to priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.484" offset="1369254">We submit that that decision is simply wrong, both on the basis of precedent and because it was undesirable, practical effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.137" offset="1407811">The precedents are entirely clear in holding that the priority statute applies not only to debts which are due in the sense of being presently payable, when at the moment that insolvency occurs, but it also applies to debts where the obligation has accrued, but the time for payment has not yet arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.484" offset="1505195">In fact the respondent does not really dispute this, but we submit that that fact alone should demonstrate the Common Law Action for Debt which requires that the debt be presently payable is not an appropriate standard for defining debts due.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.579" offset="1573636">Indeed if the standard were strictly applied, there could be some question about whether taxes would be within the priority at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.417" offset="1604983">Since there are some precedent indicating that taxes are not Common Law debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.812" offset="1626508">And of course the status of taxes which have accrued, but which are not payable at the precise point of the insolvency would still more uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.640" offset="1681887">There is not any such uncertainty now.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.165" offset="1691918">Priority statute clearly applies to all accrued taxes, including un-liquidated ones and to those which have accrued but are not yet due, when the insolvency occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.008" offset="1743327">The priority statute also has long been assumed to apply to contract debts of the sort involved here where the obligation has been established by the time that the insolvency occurs, but the precise amount of the obligation is not settled until later.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.982" offset="1815216">The effect on Government Revenues of altering this long-standing interpretation of the priority statute is hard to estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.427" offset="1848967">Indeed for the tax applications, we really have not been able to get any estimate because the effect of the decision is so unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.852" offset="1882717">What it does is create questions, but there is really no way of telling what the precise impact of it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.020" offset="1915422">On the contract applications, the Defense Department has estimated that in a typical year, perhaps some $20 million in Government claims in Defense contracts alone might be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.049" offset="1967458">There is a further reason why the decision below should be reversed, in addition to its precedent and its effect on Government revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.427" offset="2000999">It provides a practically unworkable standard for the person who must distribute the insolvent's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.282" offset="2028480">He must decide whether a given Government claim is entitled to priority and if he guesses wrong, he may be personally liable to the Government for the amount paid to the other creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.705" offset="2086158">It is therefore very important to have clear standards for determining when the priority applies and the limitations of the Common Law Action for Debt are certainly not the kind of clear standards that are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.056" offset="2151569">The respondent seems to agree that the decision below cannot really mean exactly what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.994" offset="2175288">He suggests that nevertheless, this Court should limit the debts to which the priority statute applies to ones which have been liquidated before the insolvency occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.479" offset="2221264">But that limitation too is unsupported by precedent and it is also unrelated to the purpose of the priority statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.167" offset="2255954">The Courts have consistently interpreted the statute as applying to all types of debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.820" offset="2278629">They have recognized that its broad purpose is to protect the Federal Revenues and when a particular debt is liquidated, is not significant in terms of that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.984" offset="2331291">The Government's interest in assuring that the debts owed to it will be paid is not related to the time of the precise amount of the debt is determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.242" offset="2376327">But there is an appropriate source of guidance for determining the meaning of the debts in the priority statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.521" offset="2401404">That source is the Bankruptcy Act, which uses the precise term and as used in the Bankruptcy Act, the term “debts” explicitly includes un-liquidated and contingent claims.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="588.589" stopTime="594.266">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="588.589" offset="2457620">Of course the Bankruptcy Act came along a hundred years later and on the statutes on which this case is based?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harriet_s_shapiro" startTime="594.266" stopTime="775.790">
            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="594.266" offset="2480398">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.736" offset="2486250">The current Bankruptcy Act did.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.996" offset="2495340">There was an earlier Bankruptcy Act about 1800 which also recognized certain contingent claims as debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.138" offset="2555840">And the priority statute refers in effect to the Bankruptcy Act since one of the types of in -- one the acts which makes it applicable or any is any kind of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.012" offset="2635357">And moreover the Bankruptcy Act refers to the priority act in defining debts which are entitled to priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.343" offset="2672660">So there is a distinct cross reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.470" offset="2685198">Both Acts deal with insolvency and protect Federal interests by providing Federal priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.601" offset="2713724">So both reflect similar policies and moreover they are overlapping in the sense that a case involving one statute will very often also involve the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.397" offset="2776940">So differences in interpretation of identical languages under these circumstances almost certainly will lead to confusion and such differences should be avoided unless they are clearly required by the statute's language or by it is purpose and no such difference is required here.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.809" offset="2858547">Un-liquidated claims are debts under the Bankruptcy Act and for that reason they also should be considered debts under the priority act.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.015" offset="2899402">This interpretation of the Act has an entirely practical advantage, not only to the Government, but also to those who contract with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.036" offset="2931481">From the Government’s point of view, the priority should attach when the contract is breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.795" offset="2958439">If it does not, the debtor can manipulate the time at which he becomes insolvent in order to avoid the Government’s priority and he may very often want to do that in order to prefer creditors with whom he may want to deal later.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.561" offset="3021551">Manipulation is not -- it would not be difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.511" offset="3033358">He would have simply have to make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or file an involuntary petition in bankruptcy, promptly after he has breached his contract before the Government has a chance to liquidate its damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.381" offset="3084872">But to try to protect itself from having its priority defeated in that way, the Government in its turn would have to liquidate its claims as rapidly as possible even perhaps by terminating contracts where it had doubts about the contractor’s insolvency and that certainly is not a policy that would benefit contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.403" offset="3156970">It might very well lead to increased litigation over contract terminations and it could increase business instability by tending to push border line companies in insolvency.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.790" offset="3206498">Well, unless if you are right that debts due does include un-liquidated claims, certainly it is in the interest of the disposing of these insolvent's estate for the Government to liquidate its claims as rapidly as possible, otherwise this insolvency estates are going to be tied up indefinitely, if you are correct in your basic premise?</text>

            <text syncTime="835.364" offset="3444735">There certainly is no chance that the Government is going to delay liquidation if its priority does not turn on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="898.094" offset="3695719">The second one was liquidated within the time which -- within which the assignment could still have been avoided by a petition in bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1408.431" offset="5737032">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.381" offset="5756780">The question in this case is whether un-liquidated contractual claims of the United States constitute a debt due within the meaning of priority statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.793" offset="5794501">Now, we differ with Ms. Shapiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.488" offset="5805264">Several times she said, “All debts” and the Court says, “the question we are talking about right now is whether this type of claim is a debt within the meaning of the statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.076" offset="5851657">It appears to me that there are four factors very important to the resolution of this case and two of those factors would indicate a narrow decision, a narrow interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.841" offset="5910694">Two of them would indicate a more expansive interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.192" offset="5932114">The first two involve the meaning of the term debt due at Common Law at that time approximately when this statute was first written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.507" offset="5973388">The statute was first written in the 1780’s and has been carried forward substantially unchanged is that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.435" offset="6005048">The second factor again which I think would indicate and lead to a narrow interpretation of the statute is the concept to the fairness of all the creditors in this situation, including the Government, including the other creditors who dealt with Emsco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.608" offset="6069727">The factors favorable to the Government’s position or a line of cases indicating that this particular statute should be construed liberally for the purpose of protecting the Government’s purse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.842" offset="6122704">Also a line of cases in which the matter of priority has just been assumed with no real discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.179" offset="6180069">Ms. Shapiro has adequately related the facts giving rise to this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.354" offset="6200758">The only thing I might add was that this company, Emsco Screen Pipe Company was in a failing financial situation when it entered into these contracts with the Government and managed to sort of prolong its existence on for another couple of three months and then ultimately went into the assignment for benefit of creditors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.194" offset="6552052">That was one of the disputes that arose in this particular case, Your Honor, not this trial, but at the trial of the Navy’s claim because the company argued that there was a misunderstanding between the government and the company at that time and that the company was not really financially able to perform this contract and the government was required to make a determination that it was and there was just some confusion in that and the company thought it was, but a wrong standard was applied and it should never been awarded this contract in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.101" offset="6707742">These arguments are kind of detailed a little bit in the brief, but the main point that I wanted to cover was whether the idea of this un-liquidated claim was debt due within the statute in accordance with the Common Law definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.326" offset="6772630">There was a question as to the time of the time of the liquidation of the Government’s claim and the claims were liquidated soon after the time of the assignment for benefit of creditors and this lawsuit was generated to determine the applicability of the priority statute to un-liquidated claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.886" offset="6874821">The first that I think the most important factor in the resolution of this case and the interpretation of the term debt was what the term meant to the framers of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.169" offset="6924036">And to get some indication of that, we’re going back to look at the particular meanings of the term “debt” and “debt due” in the Common Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.512" offset="6965309">And our argument is that the Common Law did not comprehend a debt as an un-liquidated claim that you could have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.445" offset="7001045">A debt where the matter was, say on a promissory note, it might not be presently payable, but it was readily ascertainable and it was a sum of certain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.713" offset="7078158">In that case, Massachusetts was arguing with the United States over, again the proceeds of an assignment for benefit of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.061" offset="7119536">There were two taxes that were owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.828" offset="7130612">There were Federal unemployment taxes owed and there were State unemployment taxes owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.635" offset="7153809">And the assignee took the position that he was entitled to pay the State unemployment claims to the extent of 90% of the Government’s, of the Federal Government’s claims because there was a provision in Federal Government statute that you could get 90% credit for any amounts payable to a State Fund that you have been provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.199" offset="7252134">And the Federal Government took the position that they could not do that, that at the time of the insolvency all rights were fixed and you had to pay the full amount of the unemployment tax claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.316" offset="7300617">This background is important because it bore on the resolution of the problem by the Court in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.769" offset="7334367">The Court said that you had to look to the moment of insolvency as to what the situation was at that time in order to determine whether priority applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2026.090" offset="8207693">The obligation was fixed, but the thing that I want to emphasize is that you have to look at events beyond the time of insolvency in order to determine, really whether there was any obligation because damages could have been zero on the thing on that, and I suppose that maybe a metaphysical way of approaching it, but if you have to look at events subsequent to the time of question then it would not be a debt in accordance with the Common Law thinking.</text>

            <text syncTime="2418.162" offset="9775980">I think the second factor that is of importance in this case is the concept of the fairness to all the creditors and I raise a question again, why in this situation should the Government be given particular special treatment because they were in a business relationship with Emsco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.739" offset="9854243">If you take the situation that Emsco had never bid on this contract, then the contracts would have been re-let or they would have been let to other parties at a higher price perhaps, but it would have been the same price that the Government are not paying anyway rather than coming in to this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.570" offset="9929580">How can we speculate about that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Osa Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="2465.905" offset="9966883">In the instant case there is some evidence in the record that at least there in respect to the Navy’s contract, the contract was re-let to the second bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.143" offset="10011918">The second lowest bidder at there being priced, it is on the page 44 of the appendix, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.085" offset="10039608">But the point I am trying to make is whatever the second bid would have been at that time if Emsco had not bid, the Government would have been paying a higher price if they eventually, they would up paying a higher price anyway, but the fact that Emsco bid on the case and eventually went insolvent works in this case to the Government's advantage because they are getting a lien on all the assets that Emsco had at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.964" offset="10167190">It was pointed out in our brief that if the priority is extended to the Federal Government, the other creditors get nothing and that is of course the large part that we think it is -- at least you can say it is harsh on the other creditors, perhaps not unfair but harsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.602" offset="10257678">Ms. Shapiro has indicated that the Government gets nothing if the priority statute is interpreted in such a way that un-liquidated claims are not debts due.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.768" offset="10322358">And I think she’s probably wrong on that because under the Texas Law of the assignment to the benefit of creditors, the assignee is compelled to recognize creditors, even late filing creditors, if they just notify the assignee of their claim and elect to be treated as a participating creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.219" offset="10420160">We have always in this situation treated the Government as a claimant, another creditor and I never really even thought that if priority did not extend, that the Government would not receive its prorated share of the indemnities we have briefed the case all along in that vein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.942" offset="10511066">The question of the practical aspect of the manipulation by the creditor of the Government by somehow running into bankruptcy or running into an assignment for creditors soon after the contractual default and other in order to curry favor with the remaining creditors is a specter that I suppose is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.092" offset="10611690">But I think that you need to balance that horrible example or that horrible imaginable against the situation of the present harshness on the credit of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.943" offset="10663099">As I indicated there are two factors that I think are favorable to the Government in this case and those are the cases that indicate that this case, this statute is supposed to be construed liberally to protect the Government's purse and my only response to that is, is what limits are involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.393" offset="10752856">If you look to the State Bank case, United States versus State Bank of North Carolina, Justice Story said, “Well, this language in here has to be applied reasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.949" offset="10803115">You have to give it a reasonable interpretation” and in order to give it that reasonable interpretation he said, “Look to the Common Law meanings.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.920" offset="10834984">He did not say, “Extend it to all claims or all obligations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.849" offset="10854733">He said, “Look to the Common Law meanings” and we were talking about a present debt. Other factors that militate for our decision for the Government would be the cases in which priority has been assumed even though there has been no real confrontation of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.821" offset="10930593">There are a number of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.858" offset="10942713">This is -- to follow that approach would be sort of law by accident, you know, because I do not think there is any real, there was no clear argument of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.449" offset="11005094">In closing, let me say that I believe this is a narrowly drawn statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.909" offset="11026932">The statute did not, in its terms apply to torts, did not apply to obligations, did not apply to claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.349" offset="11060682">It was drawn in terms of debt and as the term was used, I believe that the Common Law would indicate it did not comprehend un-liquidated claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2758.521" offset="11137378">Two points, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.785" offset="11142498">The first -- my first point is that the Massachusetts case really was deciding that a debt is not due when the debtor can at that point of insolvency decide whether he is going to pay the United States or the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.123" offset="11223791">That in that kind of situation you have a contingent debt that which -- it is -- that is much harder to say it is a debt due.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.889" offset="11282828">Tax claims can be contingent in the sense of uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.611" offset="11305711">For example, you can have an accrual basis tax payer who has gone a mind, the results of the -- the profits from the mind will not be determined for a period of time or when there is a sum in litigation or when there is a sales contracts where the amount payable is not determined until the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.798" offset="11406544">And finally, in the standard liquidated -- standard contract terms for damages, the liquidated damage clause is ordinarily not the exclusive remedy either, also a provision for contingent for consequential damages or other damages that result that it -- the damages here could have been determined at the moment of breach, there is no necessity to wait for the re-contracting.</text>
