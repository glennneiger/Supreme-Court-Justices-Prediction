            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103374">We will hear arguments next in General Electric against Gilbert and Gilbert against General Electric on a cross petition.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theophil C. Kammholz</label>
            <text syncTime="49.550" offset="301487">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, I do not wish to appear here with an undue lack of modesty but I should like to note that in our view, the articulation of EEOC guideline history is set forth fully and hopefully effectively in the General Electric brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.699" offset="410156">In appellant's brief at pages 12 to 15, and 42 to 48 and perhaps I should note at this point also that we do not agree with counsel for a liberty in his assertion that in the initial views of the Commission, pregnancy exclusion were considered as discriminatory but nonetheless permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.339" offset="512661">Indeed, the history of the EEOC guidelines and opinions demonstrates precisely the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.799" offset="546515">Thus in 1966, the General Counsel of EEOC, Charles Duncan who testified at the trial in the District Court issued an opinion letter and he said this, in page 43 of our brief, “an insurance or other benefit plan may simply exclude maternity as a covered risk and such an exclusion would not in our view be discriminatory.”</text>
            <text syncTime="138.866" offset="658737">His testimony also noted that in 1966, the EEOC had carefully considered all of the aspects of exclusion had considered what little legislative history there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.253" offset="712341">And had come to the conclusion that in the light of the legislative history underlying Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.246" offset="736269">And consciously and deliberately viewing that history, the Commission was at the view that the maternity benefits were in effect sui generis and could properly be excluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.287" offset="912438">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.616" offset="925813">I should note that there is not involve in this case the payment of hospital surgical coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.476" offset="961235">This is not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.575" offset="969594">We are dealing only with income maintenance on account of pregnancy and child birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.656" offset="1005957">Specifically, the General Electric Plan provides for a 60% income maintenance after the first eight days for a maximum of $150.00 in earnings and for a maximum period of 26 weeks, pregnancy, child birth disabilities excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.134" offset="1103864">The record also shows in our case that on the American Industrial scene at the time of trial, approximately 40% of the American Industrial work force was covered by one form or another of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.449" offset="1173141">Virtually all of those plans limited applicable maternity leave, income maintenance to six weeks, a few exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.498" offset="1213265">Now, what we are dealing with here is a problem that cuts across all of these plans and if the Court should find that there may be no differentiation, then each and every one of these plans would be subject to attack on the theory that there is as different treatment for maternity benefits and illness and sickness otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.091" offset="1311694">The other 60% of the American work force is not covered by Disability Plans and there is one who has been active on the scene over the many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.603" offset="1357774">It is my view and I represent to the Court that there would be a serious inhibiting impact on other employers to get involved in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.345" offset="1396749">Because this is not a social welfare program applicable to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.699" offset="1414094">We are talking about a private plan paid entirely in our case by an employer and the question is, must these benefits be equated.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.894" offset="1462891">I would like very briefly to put into focus the history of the GE Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.746" offset="1490267">It was adapted in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.204" offset="1500089">It is now financed entirely by employer contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.547" offset="1521510">The underlying reason for the pregnancy disability exclusion is shown in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.883" offset="1558812">GE concluded that for a number of reasons it would be appropriate not to cover this kind of income maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.014" offset="1603430">Thus, under GE’s experience, 40% of females who leave the job because of pregnancy do not return.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.064" offset="1651599">This contrast with a return well up in the 90 percentile range for sickness and accident, absence otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.210" offset="1700187">So, to pay income maintenance would in effect be providing a form of severance pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.117" offset="1727772">Secondly, the GE experience indicated that the median absence for a sickness and accident generally was two weeks, for maternity, 13 weeks.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.559" offset="2301526">We are not taking here the view that business considerations, they bona fide occupational qualification exception is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.830" offset="2334649">We are saying simply that for a sound and solid business reasons, this exclusion was written into the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.879" offset="2366832">And if I may, there are other several aspects to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.717" offset="2382192">Next, the practice of the insurance industry has been to exclude coverage for this kind of risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.265" offset="2416360">The theory of sickness and accident coverage is to protect against the unexpected, the unforeseen.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.769" offset="2446349">Pregnancy, child birth can be planned indeed in society today as the New York Times noted last week where we were practically at the point of a contraceptive society where all children are planned.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.859" offset="2510714">The medical record shows that pregnancy is indeed a voluntary condition, that contraceptive methods are for all practical purposes, a 100% effective, that abortion is legal, that in the early stages as referenced by one of the medical experts, it is an in and out noon hour treatment at menstrual extraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.684" offset="2618025">The techniques, the pill for example, according to another medical expert is virtually fail-safe yet according to the record, one incidence of pregnancy in 100 years of exposure to intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.615" offset="2689810">Now, beyond these considerations, GE’s actual experience in terms of cost in 1970 show that the average cost for female absence with no income maintenance included, ran $82.00 a year as contrasted with $42.00 a year for males.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.466" offset="2793150">The next year, the cost range was from $112.00 for females to $62.00 for males.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.586" offset="2833692">The actuarial testimony at trial showed that the average of insurance plans in effect in this country at the time of trial result in a payment of 170% of premium cost attributable to females.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.100" offset="2907671">That with a six-week pregnancy income maintenance program this would increase by roughly 1/3 to 230% and that for equated coverage no matter how long the absence, the percentile cost would rise to somewhere between 300% and 330% of the cost of male coverage.</text>
