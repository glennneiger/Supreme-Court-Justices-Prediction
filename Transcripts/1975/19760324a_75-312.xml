            <label>Ms. Maureen Pulte Reilly</label>
            <text syncTime="17.252" offset="68963">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.286" offset="85055">For the record, I am Maureen Reilly, Assistant Corporation Counsel for the City of Detroit, representing Coleman A. Young, Mayor of Detroit, and the department heads who petitioners in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.457" offset="145763">The Court is asked this morning to review a decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals which by two to one decision invalidated Amendments to the City’s Zoning and Licensing Laws regulating adult businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.098" offset="212323">This case is now before the Court approximately eight years after the first -- the problem first became apparent in the City of Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.105" offset="256418">In 1969, there were only two of these new uses, land uses within the city -- two adult bookstores, two adult theaters and relatively few topless go-go bars.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.424" offset="313678">Within a period of three years, that number had changed so that there were 18 adult theaters, 21 adult bookstores and 70 topless bars.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.697" offset="366759">Reports from the Detroit Police Department indicated that these businesses had clustered together along the main arteries of the City of Detroit and were immediately adjacent to or backed up to neighborhoods, residential neighborhoods which were zoned residential.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.839" offset="443350">Based on the complaints received by a number of families, residents and businessmen whose businesses served those families, the Mayor recommended changes in the City’s Zoning and Licensing Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.591" offset="506358">The changes that were adopted were these: The adult businesses were now designated as regulated uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.706" offset="542824">These were uses which had been determined by the council to be businesses, which had a deleterious effect on the surrounding neighborhood, which caused a downgrading in property values and the deterioration of the neighborhood generally.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="151.451" stopTime="159.621">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="151.451" offset="605727">The category of regulated uses had been one that was part of the Detroit zoning pattern for many years, hasn’t it been?</text>

            <label>Ms. Maureen Pulte Reilly</label>
            <text syncTime="159.621" offset="638433">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.737" offset="642926">The idea, the concept of regulated uses so far as I know was a new concept of inverse zoning adopted by the city in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.079" offset="684304">The city found out that certain uses when clustered together caused the downgrading of a neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.761" offset="710949">The uses --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="186.492" offset="745953">As contrast with the neighborhood patronage?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maureen_pulte_reilly" startTime="188.462" stopTime="404.994">
            <label>Ms. Maureen Pulte Reilly</label>
            <text syncTime="188.462" offset="753789">That’s right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.709" offset="766746">It seemed only proper that the adult businesses be included in the regulated use category because they follow the same pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.055" offset="796212">They cluster together, they drew patrons who are not members of the immediate neighborhood but from the surrounding community and had operational characteristics which set them apart from other types of theaters and bookstores.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.845" offset="863295">These theaters and bookstores which offered a substantial portion of their stock and trade or they films were sexually stimulating on the spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.246" offset="904882">It was not like a drugstore that would offer pill and you go home and five hours later you feel sexually stimulated, whether you walked in to the theater, and watched the film on the screen or you walked in to the bookstore and review the material there, the immediate reaction was sexual stimulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.753" offset="970919">I think this Court can almost take judicial notice of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.824" offset="987220">When these persons left the store not only the residents were aware of how they may have been sexually stimulated but prostitutes were aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.846" offset="1031314">And prostitutes began coming into these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.935" offset="1043644">It’s a matter of record in the City of Detroit that in these areas where the adult businesses clustered, so-called massage parlors opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.446" offset="1077708">We have padlocked 12 massage parlors within the last few years, all of them in the area of the adult businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.907" offset="1107592">I called the massage parlors but in fact they were fronts for houses of prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.089" offset="1128281">This is one of the adverse effects which is caused by the adult businesses particularly when they cluster together.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.121" offset="1156389">And this is one of the adverse effects that the families are concerned about when they send the women and the children and some of the men who are concerned to the business area which includes these adult businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.957" offset="1219814">In 1972, when we passed the ordinances, there was no immediate reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.837" offset="1255340">The people generally seemed to favor the ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.398" offset="1269551">Early in 1973, we had our first test of the ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.021" offset="1284075">The respondents in this case, the American Mini Theatres Inc. and Nortown Theatre Inc. both opened adult theaters in the City of Detroit in violation of the city’s zoning regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.106" offset="1344366">Both were within 1000 feet of two other regulated uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.103" offset="1360353">In fact, the Nortown was within 1000 feet, of I believe, seven other regulated uses; neither adult business, the respondents -- neither of the respondents sought to obtain a waiver by the neighboring community.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.872" offset="1435481">Now I recognize that the provision in the ordinance, in the zoning ordinance requiring the consent of 51% of the persons living or doing business within 500 feet of the location of the adult business is not directly before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.928" offset="1503608">But I submit to Your Honors that indirectly, the provision is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.646" offset="1526491">If this Court accepts the decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, that the city may not regulate adult businesses, because by definition, it refers to the content of the material disseminated therein, then all of the city’s regulations dealing with adult businesses will be wiped out.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.372" offset="1689391">When I say that that provision is indirectly before the court, I say that because it includes the same definition and would be wiped out, if the court refuse to allow the provision that is directly before the Court --</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="435.907" stopTime="442.987">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="435.907" offset="1743621">Before the Court of Appeals, in other words, a fortiori this, the other one would be invalidated in your submission?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maureen_pulte_reilly" startTime="442.987" stopTime="601.137">
            <label>Ms. Maureen Pulte Reilly</label>
            <text syncTime="442.987" offset="1771938">That is correct Your Honor, the other point I wish to make is that this provision was needed by council and considered by council because it took into consideration the aspect of protecting the families, the youth in the neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.163" offset="1844558">And that’s why I ask this Court not to ignore it because the package was presented to council as one package to accomplish two ends, two avoid clustering in the neighborhoods in the business area that served the neighborhood, and to ensure the businessman in the zoned business district and the residents that they would continue to have a voice in the kind of neighborhood that they lived in, and to ensure their commitment to the neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.964" offset="1963781">And this provision, the 51 Consent provision has to be at least considered by the Court in the total picture that we’re trying to present to the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.673" offset="2010593">The respondents in this matter, the two adult theaters, who by the way admit that they are adult theaters in their complaint in the federal district court and the state unequivocally that no minor were permitted, brought the suit in the federal district court contending that their constitutional rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendment were being violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.264" offset="2121038">I’m sure this Court is aware that the District Court reversed the rule that provision relating to the 51% consent was ruled unconstitutional because the court said it was too restrictive to accomplish the legitimate interest sought to be accomplished by the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.046" offset="2208183">The reason being that the ordinance dealt with a particular residential unit when the court said, we had shown that we were attempting to protect the neighborhood and obviously a single residential unit is not a neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.040" offset="2268160">So that ordinance was stricken because it was more restrictive that necessary to accomplish our purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.568" offset="2294178">The other provision of the zoning law relating to the 1000-foot restriction was upheld as being a legitimate way of protecting the city’s interest, in allowing the neighborhoods to remain stable and to protect them in providing an atmosphere in which the neighborhood and the business people would continue to live in the neighborhood and --</text>

            <text syncTime="881.210" offset="3524754">In many cases decided by this Court recently, the Court has looked to the content of the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.086" offset="3556310">I get the impression from the Fort Dix case that was announced today, that the Court said, it is political material, but under the circumstances considering the interest of the state in protecting the military atmosphere in a camp devoted entirely to military purposes and balancing that with the interest of the person who seek to disseminate their political views.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.295" offset="3657143">The balancing results in a favorable position on behalf of the state, that the state’s interest is more important under this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.317" offset="3705208">This balancing of interest has been applied in the Ginsberg versus New York case where the Court said, “Material may not be obscene as to adults but may be regulated as to minors,” specific material dealing with sexual conduct if appealing to the prurient interest of the minors, it may be separated and regulated, even though it is not obscene and cannot be totally prohibited.</text>

            <text syncTime="2432.519" offset="9729985">The City of Detroit has said as a basis and has filed many affidavits by a professor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.351" offset="9765303">They have said that there are certain characteristics which because of their very nature cause serious deleterious effects.</text>

            <text syncTime="2451.019" offset="9804069">And I might point out to the Court, this ordinance takes effect that the inception of the operation of the theater or the bookstore, that is to say, there is no theater or bookstore showing adult materials, they have to request -- a bookstore or theater has to request a waiver in essence in the case of the Nortown, a waiver of the standards in order to operate as an adult theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.330" offset="9901244">The City of Detroit said that there are certain interests, there is a basis for this interest and they submit affidavits upon which they base their interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.122" offset="9944398">And if we looked at the affidavits, what they really say is, the people object to the materials coming into their area.</text>
