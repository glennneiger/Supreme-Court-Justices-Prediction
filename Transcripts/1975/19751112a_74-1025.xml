            <text syncTime="49.752" offset="302321">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.786" offset="306500">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.654" offset="321965">The issue in this case is whether or not eight men, eight truck drivers, discharged for dishonesty of which they were innocent shall be permanently deprived of their jobs, their livelihoods and their good names, because they were afforded the form without the substance of agreements proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.685" offset="422066">That issue arises on these facts, on June 5th 1967, eleven Anchor Motor Freight truck drivers were discharged for the alleged dishonesty in allegedly turning in inflated motel receipts for reimbursement, and that the receipts were for more than they actually paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.785" offset="510464">On that day, the company showed its evidence to the business agents for Teamster local union number 377.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.386" offset="548916">That evidence which is in the record and in the appendix, consisted of the motel registration cards and the correlative motel receipts, the registration card showing less paid than the amount showed on the receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.840" offset="626657">In addition the, company presented the affidavits of the owner of the motel and the clerk of the motel, attesting to these records and to the fact that the man had been given receipts for more than they actually paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.274" offset="692381">In addition, there were some corroborative things in the form of logs and sign-in sheets, the men did not dispute that they had been in Batavia where their logs showed they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.106" offset="731774">They did not dispute that they had stayed at that motel, but they vigorously denied to their Union leadership that they had paid any less than the receipt that they turned in.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.143" offset="795930">After meeting between Union and company officials, it was agreed between them that the matter would be referred to the joint conference grievance committee in Detroit, that the men would continue working pending a decision on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.186" offset="852041">The men went to their, really a gasp at what have happened to them, went to the Union leadership the two business agents Angelo and Schwartz and said, what shall we do?</text>
            <text syncTime="199.728" offset="902196">Should we go up there, should you or we or somebody go up there to the motel and talk to the clerk or the owner?</text>
            <text syncTime="205.407" offset="924975">Should we get a lawyer?</text>
            <text syncTime="206.395" offset="928946">Should we do this, should we do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="208.862" offset="938768">They were advised no, do not do anything, do not worry about it, they cannot fire you, you are a sure winner, you have nothing to worry about; do not do anything we will take care of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.327" offset="976593">That is clear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.994" offset="995297">So the men headed that advice as “advice of knowing what was going on”, track driver Lingo I think, and they did not do anything, relying on the Union to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.559" offset="1045556">Well the Union did not do anything at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.809" offset="1058513">Except go to the Grievance Committee and assert, by raw assertion, the men did not do it, they must have been the motel clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.086" offset="1099682">No evidence to support that argument, just raw argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.874" offset="1114833">The men, a majority of whom went to the Grievance Committee were given the opportunity to state their contention that they did not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.725" offset="1150255">The company presented all of its evidence, not in substantial and the grievance was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.776" offset="1178468">The men were astounded having been assured that everything would be alright, and they went to their Union leadership and said, what do we know, should we get a lawyer?</text>
            <text syncTime="278.019" offset="1215352">And he said you might as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.719" offset="1222144">So they went and they got a lawyer, finally.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.071" offset="1231653">The lawyer went to Batavia, and he got a statement a notarized interrogation statement from the motel owner, which said that the motel owner had no personal knowledge whatsoever of the amount actually paid and written down that his affidavit had been based entirely on the records themselves in the word of his clerk who was his brother-in-law, but he had no firsthand knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.612" offset="1353801">Armed with this statement, the men and their lawyer sought a rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.628" offset="1389850">They were given the opportunity to appear, to ask for a rehearing and the Union agents presented this statement that the lawyer had obtained, the lawyer was not allowed to participate except to be present, read the statement of the motel owner Rapichi(ph) and the rehearing was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.802" offset="1470516">You do not get a rehearing because that is not new evidence that is the same thing you have argued the first time, totally overlooking the distinction between argument and evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.154" offset="2791894">When Mr. pegano came to Cleveland or in Ohio in September of 1968 to testify the BUC hearing, he advised the company on his own that what he had told them before was a lie, that he had pocketed the money and their company, this was denounced to the plaintiffs by the way, the company stating it is as because he changed his testimony, he was not, because he changed his story he was not required to testify, silently shipped him back to Batavia.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.919" offset="3026996">Moreover the recent decisions of this Court in Albmarle and Ratorex (ph) to make it clear that the good faith is not a defense to per se to a back pay claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="860.494" offset="3545266">And that was the genesis of the problem and there was a wildcat strike, in which a number of the plaintiffs were very active, and complained about lack of representation from the Union and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.675" offset="3589988">In any event, a suit was filed in the District Court in Cleveland, in 1972, the company after discovery was completed, filed a motion for summary judgment, motion was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.553" offset="3657488">The case was set for trial four or five times in the following year but somehow never came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.126" offset="3679849">A year later the company files a virtually identical motion for summary judgment, no new evidence, no new law, same arguments, same contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.408" offset="3712972">This time the Union makes the same arguments too, the international makes different arguments, the Court revered itself, granted the motion for summary judgment against all defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.700" offset="3754141">We appealed to the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.732" offset="3762291">The Sixth Circuit reversed with respect to Local 377 on the ground that the evidence of a breach of the duty of fair representation was sufficient for us to go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.615" offset="3825821">But held that not withstanding that fact and that they may well have prejudiced the reliability of the grievance result, the company was entitled for the benefit of it, the men were bound by it and the dismissal against the company was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.635" offset="3889873">This was decided without a great deal of discussion, without acknowledgment of all of the contrary authority around the country and virtually every circuit, either by holding or dicta that a breach of the duty of fair representation entitles the plaintiff to litigate his breach of contract action against the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.804" offset="3982556">This flows from, and the Courts that have so held do so in large part looking at Vaca.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.619" offset="4017769">Now the rule that the Sixth Circuits sets up permits the easy -- facilitates the easy end run around Vaca, you do not have to not process the grievance you just do it perfunctorily, you go through the motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.957" offset="4075134">And then it is all final and binding and every thing is fine, makes no difference how good the procedure or the substance is, as long as you go through the motions, it is final and binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.785" offset="4122468">Secondly, this case is really more within Vaca than it would appear for the reason that we are talking about a joint grievance proceeding, rather than an arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.780" offset="4162487">A joint grievance proceeding is a proceeding in which there are an equal number of Union and company representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.291" offset="4188505">And if the Union people vote for the Union people vote for the Union guy, and the company people vote for the company guy, it deadlocks and they go to the next layer and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.848" offset="4226748">Now what that means is that there is no way that the men can lose their grievance at this stage without the Union, some Union representatives voting against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.105" offset="4271783">So that is really tantamount to a decision by the Union not to process the grievance any further, similar, not identical but similar to what the Court was discussing in Vaca versus Sipes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.770" offset="6790405">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.011" offset="6803362">I think this case has to be looked at in the greater context of labor management relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.941" offset="6831052">We have to look at it from the standpoint of the congressional mandate to amicably settle disputes between employers and Unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.194" offset="6872116">We have to look at it from the derivative rights of employees under labor agreements, we have to look at it from the Unions’ statutory duty to represent and we also have to look at it from the employer’s standpoint and what are his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.414" offset="6949021">Now in order to correct any misapprehensions that the petitioners have, no employer vests anything in a Union, particularly control of a grievance machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.451" offset="7001161">These are bargained for, negotiated and resolved at the bargaining table, approved by Union membership in the same agreement that establishes their wages, holiday, vacation and pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.636" offset="7077857">And it is almost inconceivable on how they can accept the benefits of that agreement and reject the grievance machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.204" offset="7116100">In this particular case the men were accused of falsifying their expense sheets by turning in inflated motel receipts over and above what they actually paid for their lodgings while there were on the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.989" offset="7199274">Affidavits of the motel clerk and the owner specifically stated that the men requested these receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.306" offset="7244518">Even in the deposition and it is in the record where one witness recants and says that he lied, he says that this is a normal practice of the motels in the area to give inflated receipts to drivers in order to get business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.895" offset="7322885">But in any event, the case that went before the grievance committee, the same type of committee that was approved by this court in Humphrey versus Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.255" offset="7368339">The same type of committee that is negotiated and approved by the membership, that committee had before it the men who were involved, the affidavit of the motel clerk and the motel owner, the records, the receipts and the hearing took several hours and all the men had an opportunity to talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.329" offset="7476590">And all the issues of credibility of the witnesses, the motel clerk and the owner were in issue before that arbitral body.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.934" offset="7699049">So the credibility at least from our standpoint was an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.040" offset="7719529">In any event, after the arbitral body decided the case in favor of the company, a lawyer was hired who went to Batavia, New York and interviewed the motel owner, Mr. Rapichi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.863" offset="7782745">And all his affidavit said that he knew no more about this case than his brother-in-law the motel clerk, witness pegano said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.886" offset="7818899">And armed with that affidavit they returned to the grievance committee and requested rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.550" offset="7849514">And the grievance committee reconvenes, examines the affidavit of Rapichi for purposes of rehearing, and comes to the conclusion that there really is not any new evidence in this case, and accordingly finds again for the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.763" offset="7930389">Following this the men go to the labor board and file a charge with the labor board which is rejected, they appeal that rejection and it is rejected again, and they re-appeal that and it is rejected again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.936" offset="8003114">And in the chronology of events, witness pegano then says to a representative of Anchor, I was not telling the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.539" offset="8045432">A year-and-half later after all the arbitration process is exhausted, he says I was not telling the truth in my previous affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.331" offset="8084616">Now according to the petitioners, at that point they state in their briefs that right then and there ipso facto, the arbitral award is vitiated, there is no longer any evidence of any dishonesty and the men should automatically be reinstated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.901" offset="13710974">So I think it is important to point out that the action against the employer here is a breach of contract action, not a tort action, not a criminal action, there is no requirement of proof of mens rea or evil intent in a breach of contract action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.529" offset="13793416">And on that basis the employer either breached the contract or he did not irrespective of whether he was in good faith or not in good faith, to say that the discharge was not wrongful because it has been adjudicated in the grievance proceeding, is simply to pull himself up by his own bootstraps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.897" offset="13858931">That is the very issue here is how much are we going to attribute to this grievance proceeding in which grossly deficient representation in bad faith resulted in a total lack of exculpatory evidence.</text>
