            <text syncTime="65.057" offset="363548">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.524" offset="377445">My name is John G. Gill, Jr. I represent Alvin Beckwith, the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.071" offset="403567">We are here seeking a reversal of the District of Columbia Circuit affirmance of his conviction on one count of attempting to evade and deceit Federal Income Taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.066" offset="471590">We feel that the Trial Court should have been reversed or should be reversed because it committed error in denying the petitioner’s pre-trial motion to suppress statements made to special agents of the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.611" offset="537732">At a crucial August 2, 1972 interview which provided the entire starting point for the net worth or expenditure circumstantial evidence, theory of prosecution and without which we believe the prosecution below would not have been able to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.561" offset="665523">The facts brought out at that pre-trial motion to suppress, the trial took place on a stipulated record after denial of the motion to suppress took the form of the testimony of two special agents of the Intelligence Division, the Criminal Division of the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.652" offset="745876">Those agents testified that in March of 1972, they received a tip from an informant that Mr. Beckwith, the petitioner was not reporting all of his income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.524" offset="797389">During the next three months, they testified, they did a considerable amount of investigation into his background, into his family, and indeed into specific transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.257" offset="840335">On August 2, 1972, unannounced at 8 a.m. in the morning, they arrived at the home of a friend in Silver Spring, Maryland where the petitioner was staying.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.280" offset="888400">The petitioner had to finish dressing and when he went into the dining room for three hours, between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m., prior to questioning, the agents read to him from a card certain advice of rights which is concededly short of the warnings required by Miranda versus Arizona if that case is held to apply to these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.849" offset="1074705">I believe I was to the point where I had mentioned that limited warnings had been given to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.352" offset="1108769">During the next three hours, the agents questioned him about a number of things which significantly are incorporated into stipulation number two which made up the starting point for the net worth prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.537" offset="1169477">Sources of possible nontaxable income during the year 1971, cash on hands going all the way back, I believe in 1965 or at least 1967 and other items through which they buttoned down the starting point for the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.266" offset="1240426">The agents testified that his liquor store in the District Of Columbia was to opened at 10:30 and the petitioner sent the person with whom he was staying who was also an employee at the liquor store to open the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.730" offset="1298209">Thereafter, after the interview, he went and produced certain records from the liquor store to the agents without any warrant or summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.493" offset="1329242">The petitioner testified that he was 44 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.340" offset="1344707">He had a ninth grade education.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.278" offset="1356410">He knew very little about tax returns and this was corroborated by the observations of the agents during their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.233" offset="1384204">He testified that he had never filed or prepared an Income Tax Return his entire life—</text>

            <text syncTime="331.292" offset="1428508">Well, in the waiver context Your Honor, it shows what needed for warnings there are because indeed there was absolutely no knowing waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.541" offset="1469468">This case is perhaps a graphic illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.159" offset="1483992">This person testified h had no idea he was incriminating himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.038" offset="1527459">Our position Your Honor, of course is that the situation was coercive from a legal and psychological point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.342" offset="1568733">I say this in the context of emphasizing the need for counsel, the need for an effective warning as he was right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.830" offset="1614604">I do not know if the truth or the non-truth of it is significant for the purposes of this argument.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="385.709" offset="1646160">Well, an absent of violation of the Fifth Amendment which prohibits compulsory self-incrimination, I presume society has an interest in seeing guilty defendants incriminate themselves so long as it is voluntary.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_gill_jr" startTime="400.770" stopTime="440.722">

            <text syncTime="401.789" offset="1710421">This particular type of statements that were being elicited from him though was specifically recognized by this Court in Holland versus United States to be probably unreliable or in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.814" offset="1754620">Point number five of the Holland Opinion which we have quoted in our brief says, in this type of an interview, a taxpayer is more often concerned with a quick settlement or a placating the agents than reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.262" offset="1804357">If I could pick up that question Your Honor, what one of us here including myself could go back four or five years and tell how much cash we had on hand with reliability?</text>
            <text syncTime="436.513" offset="1849392">I think there was a great potential for unreliability here.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="450.474" offset="1905190">And what you said, if anything that he disclosed is not supported by the government’s case in chief, perhaps it is not all that relevant is it?</text>

          <turn speaker="john_g_gill_jr" startTime="462.578" stopTime="613.440">
            <label>Mr. John G. Gill, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="462.578" offset="1953673">Well, there could be arguments made as a matter of weight but again, as this court recognized in Holland, the government agents can pick and choose among the good and the bad and used them against him as part of admissions of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.914" offset="2006963">A very incriminating, I think especially in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.126" offset="2039773">The petitioner testified that he did not recall the word criminal being used by the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.856" offset="2066731">They testified, they told him one of their functions was to investigate criminal tax fraud, the possibility of criminal tax fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.537" offset="2097451">He also testified. He did not think he had incriminated himself at all during the three-hour interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.869" offset="2130784">We feel that the decision below and the requirement of actual physical restraint and custody is improper for Miranda purposes, for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.325" offset="2180625">First of all, this we feel in the meaning of the Fifth Amendment was indeed a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.758" offset="2202359">At the beginning of his oral opinion, the District Judge which has found the appendix to the petition for certiorari at 1b, he found in fact, it was criminal from the very beginning and his finding we feel is supported by the fact that there were approximately three months of investigation of the petitioner prior to the interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.958" offset="2299117">We feel it is supported by what the United States Attorney’s office for the District of Columbia issued in the form of a press release.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.150" offset="2323881">At the time of indictment, they said petitioner was the subject of legal harassment by virtue of the prosecution of the tax laws against those who they felt were involved in narcotic underworld activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.667" offset="2385948">The obvious implication we feel being unprovable narcotic activity and we point out that petitioner has no record for such activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.076" offset="2423668">Also, the arrest was affected by the combined forces of internal revenue agents and the Bureau of Narcotic and Dangerous Drug agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.844" offset="2454702">We also feel that in addition to being clearly a criminal case at the time of the interview, this was indeed a critical stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.198" offset="2480093">We have already made reference to Holland versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.180" offset="2492005">That court recognizes and this type of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.217" offset="2504230">The starting point is crucial to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.784" offset="2514470">In fact without it, I do not think they have any case and I think it has been virtually conceded throughout the court so far that they need that starting point which came entirely out of petitioner’s own mouth.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.754" offset="2874333">This was the whole starting point which is totally necessary to this entirely circumstantial type of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.782" offset="2906411">We feel that the District of Columbia Circuits requirement of the necessity for a finding of physical restraint is particularly inappropriate for a tax prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.150" offset="2959910">We focused on the language which at least four times was repeated in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.142" offset="2975897">It said “Custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="728.058" offset="3015499">We say custody is inappropriate for tax case because arrest or the taking a person into physical restraint by the government is a matter that is foreign to the tax prosecution in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.398" offset="3076939">We have quoted the law review commentators who say, anyone who knows anything about tax prosecutions knows that arrest does not have much significance if it happens at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.043" offset="3111525">Usually, the experience I submit is that the tax violator first comes into physical restraint or custody when these appellate remedies are exhausted and he surrenders to the marshals.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.927" offset="3151022">This is so for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.698" offset="3158127">It is not a crime of violence; the government does not have any interest in getting the man off the street for the protection of others.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.818" offset="3462610">It could be inhibited by the warnings, we ask to attach in the criminal context here.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.074" offset="3487584">In this case, the crime was reported three or four month before in March of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.487" offset="3509213">They knew the existence of the crime, there was no question of identity, they knew where to go, they knew who to talk to, they were building a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.948" offset="3539097">We feel the formal accusatory stage, perhaps not as formal as an indictment but virtual or punitive, this man was a defendant, he was not accused and we asked for the accuse’ right to self-incrimination just in the same sense that Miranda sought to protect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.344" offset="3608687">Now, we recognize of course that coercion is necessary for Fifth Amendment violation and for requirements for these prophylactic Miranda type warnings to ensure voluntary waiver to ensure that the person’s right to refrain from compelling himself is not trampled upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.094" offset="3707744">We feel that during a tax investigation, there are such legal and psychological pressures at play that a taxpayer is coerced to speak that in the language of Miranda his freedom of action, freedom of choice is significantly restraint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.798" offset="6346529">First, the government’s brief at page 32 indicates this quite succinctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.221" offset="6368158">They say indeed, the petitioner had to answer the agent’s questions any way ultimately and then they go on to say as long as it would not incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.865" offset="6414761">The Seventh Circuit which has on these specific warnings in Judge Stevens’ opinion in Oliver versus the United States found that full Miranda warnings had to be given in the statement thus had to be suppressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.833" offset="6522699">The person thinks he has a compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.271" offset="6532416">There are specific Internal Revenue Code provisions compelling him to provide records, make statements, and give anything the secretary wants in the way of information.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.497" offset="6749337">However, when these agents visit him to interrogate him or asking questions and they are building a criminal case against him, he is under a compulsion that derives from the fact that he knows he will be subjected to a full scale audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.218" offset="6800224">Socially embarrassing when contacts are made with your clients, your friends, your customers, and your creditors potentially because the taxpayer in almost all matters has the burden of proof potentially very expensive, if those agents are dissatisfied and they assess the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.974" offset="6871172">These pressures we feel are at his mind and this is what has been recognized by the Seventh Circuit and on a whole, the analysis is that there are such pressures both from a civil legal point of view, confusion, complexity, that the taxpayer must be warned of the full rights under Miranda or his privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.541" offset="6977438">I think it is pointed out, if this court takes note of two cases, Malloy versus Hogan and Holland versus the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2092.849" offset="8474672">The defendant also said that he chose not to answer certain questions that were asked to him and and that he was not pressed by the agents for his answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.526" offset="8513438">After hearing the testimony of the two agents and the petitioner here, the District Court found he is entitled to it, the Miranda warning when the court finds as a fact that there were custodial circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.277" offset="8724403">It was also noted by the Circuit Court that the defendant was complaining at the meeting he was so friendly that he was deceived into believing that he was not incriminating himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.599" offset="8765677">The defendant apparently contends that this was a criminal case from the outset and that he should have had the full Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.762" offset="8798382">As we understand his position, he wants to extend Miranda far beyond the custodial circumstances considered in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.149" offset="8831923">At the outset, we dispute his basic premise that the case was criminal from the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.420" offset="8853030">The case originated from information furnished by an informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.394" offset="8876854">In 1972, the Internal Revenue Service initially screened 132 allegations of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.931" offset="8907051">Only 8,000 of these were actually resulted in an investigation and out of the 8,000 only prosecution was not recommended in 7,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.001" offset="8955326">Thus, seven out of eight cases ended up as civil matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.049" offset="8979463">The actual prosecutions were in the neighborhood of the 1,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.924" offset="9523019">The defendant talks of a warning needed when the case reaches the accusatory stage and since only one case out of 132 ripens into an indictment, I think it is very difficult to say when such a nebulous test would be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.250" offset="9588325">It seems to us that short of a reference of the case from the Internal Revenue Service to the Department of Justice, the question ends where to draw the line and we think that this court has drawn on appropriate line when they talk about the custodial circumstances.</text>
