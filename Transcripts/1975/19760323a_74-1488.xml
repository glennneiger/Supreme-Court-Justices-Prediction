            <text syncTime="32.015" offset="231363">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.453" offset="245156">This case is on direct appeal from the judgment of a Three-Judge District Court for the District of New Mexico, declaring the Wild Free-Roaming Horses &amp; Burros Act of 1971 unconstitutional and enjoining the Secretary of Interior from enforcing that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.478" offset="313179">The issue in the case is whether the Congress had authority under the Constitution to pass that federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.211" offset="340137">The suit was begun in this case by the State of New Mexico, its Livestock Board and Director and one private individual on March of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.068" offset="379634">The complaint alleged facts relating to a particular incident involving 19 burros which I deal with shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.273" offset="412444">More generally, the complaint charged that the Federal Act was interfering with the New Mexico Livestock Board’s administration of their Estray Law, Estray meaning a stray domestic animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.571" offset="465629">That as a result of that interference, the State of New Mexico was being deprived of constitutional rights and then numbers were enumerated, including the Tenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.467" offset="509201">That Congress had no authority to pass this piece of Federal legislation, because the complainant alleged, the animals in question, the wild horses and burros were not damaging or molesting, I think the term is used in this complaint, the federal land, and also because of the particular burros in question were nonmigratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.072" offset="591644">The Act, I should give a short description of, deals with as the Title indicates Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros found on federal land.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.127" offset="631768">The statute defines these animals as all unclaimed and unbranded horses and burros on the public lands of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.448" offset="673146">The statute further defines public lands to mean only those federal lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of Interior and the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.151" offset="723928">That is not an insubstantial quantitative acreage.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.910" offset="734899">About 300 million acres is encompassed within the administration of those two federal agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.133" offset="1379810">That issue is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.727" offset="1390259">These burros that were taken in this litigation or involved in this litigation were first of all found on federal land when they were seized.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.280" offset="1484405">It does not make a point of that, but so far as the evidence shows, the burros were totally on public land.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.616" offset="1801740">You frequently carry on supplemental feeding on to the land, and you find out that some wild burros are eating up your supplemental feeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.551" offset="1841551">Now, is there some evidence to that effect in this record or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="437.548" offset="1853463">There is evidence that these burros were eating protein blocks, but let me say that that is not Mr. Justice White a usual practice for all the grazing -- within Taylor Grazing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.260" offset="1892333">I think the Bureau of Land Management at least has informed me that supplemental feeding is something that is frowned upon usually.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.958" offset="1911141">You are not supposed to -- as well salt, and the reason for that is, because the burros and horses then tend to browse more than they otherwise would which is damaging to public land in a way that it would otherwise not.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.444" offset="1977074">Well, that is active or not, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.565" offset="1985538">But in this particular case, the burros that were involved here were seized from one Mr. Kelley Stephenson’s ranch in New Mexico, in the South Central part of New Mexico, and the case arose as follows: While Mr. Stephenson, a New Mexico cattle rancher, was visiting BLM offices and dropped by to talk to a number BLM officials, he was told by them that they had seen 25 burros around an area called Taylor Well.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.201" offset="2104134">Now, Taylor Well is on federal land and Taylor Well is a joint watering spot for this particular rancher and another rancher.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.311" offset="2132555">Mr. Stephenson, the rancher in question here, had a six-month permit to graze about 40 head of cattle as a winter pasture in this particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.590" offset="2173619">That was the first, apparently Mr. Stephenson knew about the burros around Taylor Well.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.058" offset="2191592">As a matter of fact, he said he was surprised because although he had been in the area for 29 years and had seen burros in the Foothills to the east, he had never seen them around this particular well.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.562" offset="2229521">At that point, as far as Mr. Stephenson knew, the burros and the cows were getting along, there was no harm, whether they are eating his protein blocks or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.213" offset="2260137">The Bureau of Land Management certainly did not know, at least all they have was a photograph of the burros standing around the well.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.744" offset="2286259">Now, Mr. Stephenson returned to his ranch and confirmed the presence of the burros, but rather than calling up the Bureau of Land Management, after he allegedly, as the complaint says found that the burros were molesting the cows, rather than doing that, he called the New Mexico Livestock Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.969" offset="2363164">Now, Mr. Justice White, you mentioned the problem of the burros perhaps interfering with the cows.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.493" offset="2381241">There is a provision in the regulations that the Bureau of Land Management has promulgated under the Wild Horses and Burros Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2882.110" offset="11631722">They say that it means “all unbranded non-claimed horses and burros and their offspring that have used public lands on or after December 15, 1971 or,” and this is an important phrase, “or that do use these lands as all or part of their habitat” and I am saying to you that these animals on this record fit within that last category.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.654" offset="12881943">The Migratory Game Act, if I can address that for just a moment, involves or did involve basically the same argument that we got here with our donkey case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.129" offset="12927814">Way back in 1914, I think was the first Federal Court decision that came out of the State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.808" offset="12966579">U.S. against Shauver which is cited in the briefs that involved a 1913 Federal Act called the Migratory Bird Act and the Federal court there in Shauver struck it down as violative of the constitution and incidentally both the Property clauses and the Commerce clauses were relied upon by the government for their authority to pass that Migratory Bird Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.712" offset="13086116">That case was not appealed and that decision was not looked up by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.134" offset="13103879">A year later in the State of Kansas, another Federal district court did exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.764" offset="13130419">They said that the Property Clause and the Commerce Clause is no authority to Congress to pass a Migratory Bird Act and they did it on the basis of ownership of game.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.873" offset="13186844">Then in 1916, just a year after that, there was a treaty entered into between Great Britain and United States, involving the protection of Migratory Waterfowl between Canada and United States and Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.516" offset="13245358">That was a treaty and following that, Congress passed another Act called the Migratory Bird Treaty Act which was the subject of the litigation in Missouri against Holland in 1920 in which it was held that the Congress did have authority to pass that, but it was the treaty making authority which gave it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.203" offset="13336160">It was not the Property Clause which has been rejected in these two earlier Federal Court cases nor it was the Commerce Clause, it was the treaty power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.297" offset="13364476">That is not involved in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.228" offset="13372209">We do not have Migratory fowls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.661" offset="13377956">As a matter of fact, the Three-Judge Federal court so held and that we are not talking about a migratory situation with these animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.264" offset="13404392">They tend to stay in one area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.338" offset="13416617">They do not migrate from state to state and certainly not from country to country as do the waterfowl.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.801" offset="13442530">I think those cases support our view in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.755" offset="13458308">I think the two earlier Federal District Court cases are exactly, the theory that we are asserting to this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.837" offset="13494671">That the Property Clause and the Commerce Clause do not give Congress authority to regulate in area that has since statehood, since the nationhood, has belonged exclusively to the states, that is a right to manage their game animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.991" offset="13563321">Now, I have not touched the Commerce Clause nor was that discussed I think at length at all for that matter by a counsel for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.429" offset="13636986">The Commerce Clause as the lower court also found that is embodied in its opinion here, was not relied upon by a Congress in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.415" offset="13677005">There are no congressional findings at all with reference to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.225" offset="13692261">It is not mentioned anywhere in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.104" offset="13699680">There is not anything in this record and incidentally the Federal Governments had the right to make a record and to put on evidence in this case and they declined to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.790" offset="13730504">There is no evidence in this case or anywhere in this record as to any burdens of any kind that would be imposed upon interstate commerce in this case with respect to these animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.388" offset="13788914">That simply is not in the case and the lower court so held that the Commerce Clause was not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.520" offset="13813365">As a matter of fact, the Act itself expressly bases its provisions upon the Property Clause by simply saying and this I think is a novel theory that these animals are a part of the land that is the fallacy, the false premise upon which the whole argument of the government in this case is based and it is asserted in a very short sentence on page 9 of the government's reply brief where they say “These animals are part of the public domain.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.484" offset="13957247">They base their whole Property Clause argument upon the fact that these animals are part of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.575" offset="13977623">Every case that they cite in their brief pertains to situations where either number one, the case is concerned with a disposition or some control of the lands itself or something that is related directly to it and a part of it, the Ashwander case, TV Authority case, concerned Government bans on electrical energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.498" offset="14085352">They fell in that category of cases in their briefs are they fell in the category of protecting the government's land against damage and no one has any quarrel with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.054" offset="14119520">Certainly the government has the right to do so, but all their cases are directed to that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.146" offset="14143866">They do not cite a case nor have we found one which stands for this new and novel proposition that wild animals are a part of the Federal soil, and therefore, under our Property Clause, we have the right to the exclusive regulation and the management and the ownership of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.673" offset="14218054">We think that the Federal Court was right and it is willing any reversal of that is going to have, I think a catastrophic effect with respect to all 50 of the states as to their game regulation provisions and certainly to the western states where as here, Nevada who is represented here at the counsel table today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.504" offset="14325365">There are some 86% of the lands within its state boundaries that belongs to the Federal Government and in my state where more than a third of it does are or Alaska where 90 plus % of it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.552" offset="14373534">It is going to have a staggered effect upon not only the game management in all those states, but a tremendous economic impact upon the cattle in the ranching industries in all those states and particularly the western states whereas here as suggestion was made by counsel, all they got to do is put a little drift fence across the middle of their ranch and protect their fee lands from these donkeys and that just is not a practical solution to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.503" offset="14501325">There being no constitutional authority to Congress under either these clauses, we think that the lower court's judgment must be affirmed.</text>
