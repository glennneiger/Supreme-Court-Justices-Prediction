            <text syncTime="37.089" offset="251637">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.543" offset="261459">My name is Seymour L. Honig.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.276" offset="268460">I am an attorney form Tampa, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.904" offset="278909">Seated at counsel table is Richard H. McGuinness, also an attorney from Tampa, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.046" offset="299493">Mr. McGuinness and I represent the petitioner John Geders.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.280" offset="324466">Your Honors, the petitioner is here pursuant to issuance of writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit to review what appears to be, a conflict between two circuits regarding the question presented for review before this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.448" offset="385070">The matter on review arises out of certain trial proceedings, in the United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, in which the petitioner John Geders was on a trial as a defendant charged with particular offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.394" offset="448914">During the trial, the Court issued an across the board incommunicado order, prohibiting the defendant from communicating, or having any access to and with his attorney during a 16-hour overnight recess period between the conclusion of direct examination and the conclusion of cross examination of the defendant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.867" offset="558733">The role of in factual situation Your Honors, as it relates to the question presented for review, commenced on the next to the last day of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.417" offset="600946">At that time, the petitioner Geders took the witness stand on his own behalf and his attorney Mr. Rinehart, who was a defense counsel at the time of the trial, completed direct examination at approximately 4:55 p.m. in the afternoon, a usual time for recess in the United States District Court, the Middle District in Tampa.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.003" offset="691330">However, in response to a motion of the prosecutor Mr. Blasingame, His Honor Judge Klinsmann decided to recess the particular trial until the following day, apparently Mr. Blasingame wanted to prepare as not unusual for a cross examination, because there was an extensive direct examination of the defendant in that particular matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.022" offset="811389">But recess was not ordered Your Honors, before the prosecutor, Blasingame questioned the Court with respect to certain instructions that he desired that the Court issue to the accused and his counsel and with the permission of the Court, I would like to refer to page 17 of the appendix at which time Mr. Blasingame stated, has this witness been instructed now that he has not to talk to anyone whatsoever, including his attorneys or anyone, about this case at all and this is the prosecutor Your Honors addressing the Court at the time that recess was going to be ordered by the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.214" offset="984215">Just below that Mr. Rinehart, in response thereto stated, if he were instructed not to talk to his attorney, I feel that it would be improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.317" offset="1016607">I think I always have the right to talk to my client, Of course the emphasis is mine, but the words are Mr. Rinehart’s.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.882" offset="4326844">And lastly, we would urge that this violation, that this federal constitutional violation occurred during the critical stage of the proceedings, namely during the trial itself, between the termination of direct examination of the defendant and the termination or conclusion of cross examination of the defendant the following day by the Government prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.686" offset="4418063">We would further submit that the denial of right to consult with counsel for a 16-hour period of time is in contravention to a basic constitutional safeguard and as such is inherently prejudicial, inherently prejudicial and is per se, reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.097" offset="4499670">In support of this position, the petitioner relies upon Glasser versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.064" offset="4527568">Powell v. Alabama, Hamilton v. Alabama, Gideon versus Wainwright and Argesinger versus Hamlin and sir, oh! I am sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.467" offset="4581172">These cases we submit, all pertain to the denial of assistance of counsel for one’s defense and we would further submit as we have before that the denial of assistance of counsel for one’s defense in each of the above cases, from Powell v Alabama through Argesinger v Hamlin was deemed inherently prejudicial and was per se reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.508" offset="4693394">In the Glasser case without going into any quotations, the Court considered that the right to have the assistance of counsel was so fundamental and absolute right that the courts could not indulge in nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising form the denial and we would submit that, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.036" offset="4791510">We further contend Your Honors, that the rule of harmless error as promulgated in Chapman v. California is irrelevant and inappropriate to the question presented for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.718" offset="4842187">We would submit Your Honors, that the harmless error rule applies to the evaluation and measurement of the prejudicial quality and quantity if any, of tainted evidence admitted in the trial of an accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.899" offset="4914912">But the harmless error rule, we would submit, is not applied in measuring prejudice which inherently flows from the violation or from the denial of a basic constitutional safeguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.532" offset="4973426">We urge that the harmless error rule, as promulgated in Chapman v. California does not apply nor can it realistically apply to a violation of a basic constitutional safe guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.345" offset="5024731">This Court has recently dealt with harmless error cases in Hamilton v. State of California and Milton v. Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.578" offset="5061616">I would submit two very typical cases where a harmless error has been applied and in both cases, the Court was dealing with the admission of tainted evidence, if you would, or a testimony, but in the face of which there was overwhelming evidence to convict and so this was deemed by the Court to be a harmless constitutional error, but the Chapman v. California doctrine puts the burden of proof above and beyond the exclusion of all reasonable doubt as you have it in any criminal proceeding upon the Government to establish the absence of prejudice or harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.123" offset="5247817">It would be impossible, we submit for the Government to at all put forth such proof in this particular case nor have that and not having done so that certainly could not be considered harmless -- they certainly have not met their burden with respect to the harmless error doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.817" offset="5326602">The Fifth Circuit, we submit, was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.728" offset="5346246">One, they not only misapplied the Chapman case, we submit, they should not have applied Chapman case to the particular ruling that they made in this case, but that they misinterpreted it as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.216" offset="5388146">Chapman is very clear, I will submit Your Honor, that the burden is upon the Government to prove above any reasonable doubt that there was an absence of prejudice or harmless error and this is to protect them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2153.330" offset="8716669">The issue here is a narrow one, whether the instruction that the District judge gave without more requires reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.291" offset="8764525">Petitioner’s position is that this is error and it is error that cannot be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.212" offset="8788140">I think the place to start is on page 18 of the appendix, just to look exactly how this issue arose?</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.226" offset="8828264">On the bottom of page 18, defense counsel told the Court, I feel that I do not have the right to confer with him my client -- I do have the right to confer with him, but not to coach him as to what he may say on cross examination, or to how to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.132" offset="8911856">Thereafter a little further down, the Court says, I think you might ask him right now, right here while we are here, what does he think, he thinks you ought to call in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.890" offset="8966922">Let us put it this way, you ask him right now, if he thinks that there are any witnesses, you ought to call during the evening, if anything comes up after he has been crossed examined and after you have had an opportunity for redirect, we would have a recess and you are going to have as much time as you want to talk over trial strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.216" offset="9040169">So this case really arises under circumstances where counsel who is best familiar with the defendant and said to the Court, I really do not want to talk to him about his testimony at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.115" offset="9103804">All I want to talk to him about there other matter and the Court says, okay, if you want to talk about other matters, that is fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.145" offset="9135882">You can talk to him about other matters now, and if you need extra time at the conclusion of the direct examination, or after the cross examination, I will give you additional time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2367.599" offset="9573694">Yeah, well, let me -- let me just put this case in little, add some extra facts to put this in perspective, this whole incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.317" offset="9608594">This trial covered a two weeks span.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.499" offset="9621342">The Government completed this case and the case, what case was, the defendant was charged and convicted of conspiring to import 1,000 pounds of marijuana in the United States and his defense was entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.266" offset="9676408">Now, the Government completed this case during the first week of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.417" offset="9696992">In fact, it completed this case on Thursday and except for two witnesses who testified the following week that the substance imported was marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.671" offset="9761985">At this point on Thursday, the Court recessed and so both the government and defense counsel had Thursday night, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to discuss the cases with their witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.081" offset="9823634">Now, during the course of the presentation of the case, the Court had instructed all of the Government witnesses, in the same fashion as it instructed the defense -- the defendant here, not to talk to lawyers during a recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.924" offset="9898971">Indeed when the case commenced on the second week when there was a motion on behalf of petitioners attorney that the Government’s case agent who I have been called as the defense witness, should not be allowed to participate in a prosecutorial conference and the Court said, okay, if you do not want to participate, I will instruct to him not to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.291" offset="10008476">So this was -- the way this case was handled, both sides were treated equally, both sides were not allowed to discuss their testimony with their witnesses while the witnesses were on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.003" offset="10063333">Now, the judge even though, he put this -- put counsel in the bind so to speak as to talking to the witnesses overnight, however, he was very free and liberal in granting recesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.293" offset="10120489">For example, during the afternoon, before defendant commenced test -- commenced his testimony, he granted two recesses for defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.032" offset="10159464">One to talk to a witness and two, he granted a recess, a recess which I think is essential, the defense counsel said, I would like to talk to my client now, that the Government’s case is almost closed, so we can make a decision as to whether, he is going to take the stand and testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.471" offset="10229159">So the judge said fine, we will grant you another recess to make that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.876" offset="10254863">Now, subsequently after the defense finished -- after the Government finished its re-direct examination of the defendant there was another recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.484" offset="10325289">There was another recess and that is on page 22 of the appendix which we think is significant to show that we do not have an arbitrary judge here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.217" offset="10376176">Between, when the Government completed its cross examination it was time for a luncheon break.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.924" offset="10399059">At that point, the Court said to defense counsel, I am going to instruct your client not to talk to you, during the luncheon break.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.047" offset="10435526">At this point, counsel said, Your Honor, I know of notice on page 22, I know of no way that I can properly examine my client on redirect examination, unless I talk to him about the cross examination and about other factors pertaining to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.389" offset="10508878">So the Court said, alright you can go ahead and talk to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.445" offset="10525074">So what you really have here, is a situation just as far as we are concerned like Leighton versus United States, the Second Circuit case, in which I think you could say that all counsel was doing here was trying sow error into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.700" offset="10582125">If he had pressed, if counsel had pressed at the time -- at the conclusion between direct and cross and said, I want to talk to my client, I want to talk to him about potential questions on cross examination, there is every reason to believe that the trial judge would have done the same thing, as he did between the cross and redirect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.052" offset="10671568">Now, concededly assistance of counsel requires consultation and preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.434" offset="10693093">Counsel normally prepares a case before trial and it is often necessary not only you cannot complete the preparation of your case before trial because many things happen unexpected, so you do have to prepare for -- prepare your case while the case is proceeding and this requires you to make use of recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.780" offset="10778462">There is no question about that, but when counsel is here says I do not want a recess, I do not want to recess to talk to my client about his testimony, I think the Court is entitled to take him at phase value.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.288" offset="10916493">The reason we do is illustrated by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.929" offset="10931017">What would occur if there was a denial, would be a claim that there was a denial of effective assistance of counsel and it would be difficult for the Government to rebut, whether or not, the counsel had something that occurred which require a recess at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.980" offset="11003219">After all, there is the lawyer-client privilege relationship and there would be no way to rebut something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.021" offset="11027356">That is why we do not say this is a practice that should ordinarily follow, because it does create these types of problems, but when you have a situation where counsel says like here, I do not want to talk to my client about his testimony, that is a unique situation, and we think there is no violation of his assistance to counsel in that situation and there is no harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.667" offset="11138011">Now of course, when a defendant testifies, he subjects himself to restrictions, just like any other witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.088" offset="11179702">Under our advisory system, he is not entitled to recess just because an embarrassing question is asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.923" offset="11211049">The jury is entitled to hear his testimony and decide on the basis of his personal responses, is not to response -- not the responses of his lawyers, so the jury can -- can determine -- determine his demeanor and make its own appraisal of whether or not, he is a credible witness or not a credible witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.705" offset="11418148">The only reason we would say that ordinarily it should not be done when you have a defendant, is because you create these problems which sometimes could arise even in a post conviction proceeding in which there would be a claim, well, there is really something very essential that we have to talk about, and you denied us a right to talk and therefore, the case should be reversed because you denied the -- defendant has been denied effective assistance of counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3238.340" offset="13056653">All I want to talk to him about is what witnesses to call and the court said, okay, well, you can talk to him about what witnesses you are going to call, you can talk to him right now and in addition, if you need an additional time, you can talk to him later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.828" offset="13114644">So, I think we have a judge who was trying to be evenhanded, both to the prosecution and the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.625" offset="13149857">Now, we think that if this is error that this is not the type of error which is subject to the harmless error rule, and we think that in this case -- in this case, if you examine all of the circumstances and I will recite them briefly, if there was there, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.111" offset="13275768">In the first place, the limitation here, the restriction here, is not akin to the denial of somebody, the right of a lawyer at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.924" offset="13315056">Certainly, in those cases where a defendant has not waived his right to a lawyer, the court will not look and decide whether it has been prejudiced or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.981" offset="13355284">Here the limitation that the court placed on the overnight recess is not significantly different from the short trial where the defendant’s testimony may go forward from commencement to conclusion, covering direct and cross without any recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.290" offset="13436473">To the extent, that a recess might have significance or make a difference, since it maybe used in trial preparation, there was no harm here because counsel said he did not need the recess for -- to talk to his client about his cross examination and as far -- as far as other matters are concerned, the Court gave defense counsel opportunity at the beginning of the recess and later on to discuss trial strategy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3410.975" offset="13747226">And he says, well, I might want to talk him about, what witnesses to call and from that I think, you are going to infer that he did not want to talk to him about his trial testimony, otherwise that would have been foremost in his mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.518" offset="13809397">In addition, we think the court should be deciding that if there was error -- was harmless error, look to the fact that here we have, we do not have a situation where we have a reluctant counsel who was -- who was not pressing things for the -- on behalf of his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.499" offset="13885361">Here, when counsel was not reluctant to express his need when he thought he had talked to the defendant about his testimony, as he did before redirect examination, and if he had a need -- if he had a need, Justice Rehnquist to discuss any testimony, as to what his testimony be on cross I think he would have done the same thing at this recess, as he did in the subsequent recess which occurred the following day at the luncheon time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.216" offset="14008137">Finally, we have a case, where we have a Court which had concerned that the defendants have a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.099" offset="14039693">This Court freely granted recess just before the defendant testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.293" offset="14064457">He gave a recess for a -- to defense to talk to a Government witness, a defense witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.050" offset="14091519">Thereafter -- shortly thereafter counsel said, I would like time to talk to my defendant to decide whether the defendant should testify at that point, counsel was given another recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.388" offset="14148884">Finally, the restrictions posed were no -- were not one-sided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.677" offset="14169991">They were posed on Government witnesses and including its case agents, and in these circumstances especially since this -- there the -- the evidence of guilt as the court below found was overwhelming, we think this Court should affirm this conviction.</text>
