            <text syncTime="14.073" offset="129889">This case was brought by a Chippewa Indian, protesting that the State of Minnesota had no jurisdiction to levy a property tax on his mobile home located on land held in by the United States in trust for members of the Chippewa tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.163" offset="222257">The Minnesota courts held that, they did indeed, State did indeed have taxing authority that it had that authority accredited by an act of Congress Section 4 (a) of Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.844" offset="289026">We don't read Public Law 280 as did the Minnesota courts, and we therefore, reverse on the ground that the state did not have authority to impose a property tax on petitioner's on mobile home.</text>
