            <label>Mr. Ira Jay Sands</label>
            <text syncTime="62.689" offset="354040">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.273" offset="356443">Mr. Chief Justice and Mr. Justices of the Court, we have a very simple factual situation here, in which a National Bank is one of a number of defendants under a 1934 Act, securities action a 10 (b) (5) claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.348" offset="436691">And, we go back to a widely known dispute in this nation, in which we find the Third Circuit now, recently aligned against all of the other Circuits, as to whether in a securities related 10 (b) (5) action, the plaintiff must divide his case and must sue the National Bank in the particular district in which that National Bank was established or whether under the wide venue provisions of the 34 Act, a plaintiff may join the National Bank, together with the other defendants in the district in which the violations took place or as the 34 Act permits, where the defendants maybe located or found.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.414" offset="656956">It is our position, that in the Second Circuit, where this action commenced, under the Bruns, Nordeman case, this situation is jelled and a divided or bifurcated litigation will be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.175" offset="736055">It is our position sir, however, that that is erroneous and that the 1864 National Bank Act was not necessarily repealed by implication or otherwise by the 1934 Act, but that the venue provision of the 1864 Act was broadened, was extended in the one instance in connection with a 1934 Securities Act violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.437" offset="881087">Now, to lightly touch upon ancient history in these hollowed --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="198.875" offset="898850">Mr. Sands, you say in one instance and you are talking of course about the 34 Act, but 15 U.S.C. 77 V, the 33 Act, and the Interstate Land Sales Regulation, there are certainly are other Acts giving general venue for specific courses of action, which would be effective by a decision in this case, are there not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ira Jay Sands</label>
            <text syncTime="221.841" offset="990696">Your Honor, we of course, are concerned with a 34 Act and a 33 Act, which were overlaid as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.800" offset="1014520">However, Your Honor is correct, when any Act states that the defendants maybe sued in a venue where they maybe found or where transaction took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.520" offset="1077423">I would agree Mr. Justice Rehnquist that the argument I am professing for the 34 Act would apply if the language were similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.979" offset="1119219">Now, going back to Ancient history of these hallowed halls, we know that a National Bank is an arm of the American government.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.123" offset="1159761">The cases are -- the law had not been cited for the lack of pilling on additional material.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.975" offset="1199258">The First National Bank was organized in the late 1700s as an arm of the government and it could not be sued as the government cannot be sued without its consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.063" offset="1247532">Now, until the 1863, as modified by the 1864 Act, one could not sue a National Bank, which was set-up to administer currency, which was set-up to administer the fiscal policies of the United States, except as specifically permitted by the Congress, by the sovereign.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="308.508" offset="1337393">I thought that there were no National Banks until 1863, before that it was the Bank of the United States?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ira Jay Sands</label>
            <text syncTime="315.267" offset="1364352">Your Honor, my understanding is that there were national chattered banks prior to 1863, but the 1863 legislation, which then found itself amended in 1864 was an all encompassing scheme for the institution and the using the broad scale operation of national banks, but the first bank we find out in the brief of the SEC as amicus in their footnote --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="376.843" offset="1610739">Well, the point may not be important to your argument, but I did not mean to have you spend a real good time on it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ira Jay Sands</label>
            <text syncTime="381.707" offset="1630174">My recollection is not precise as to the thing in the SEC's amicus brief, but it is in the footnote that the First Bank was called Bank of the United States and then we had a lapse of its charter some ten years or so later and then later another bank was set-up to administer the fiscal policy of the United States called the First Bank of the United States or First National Bank of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.603" offset="1721707">And, the 1863, 1864 legislation was all encompassing, a schematic to operate national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.593" offset="1753681">Now, we take the position that this was permission by the sovereign to be sued to have one of its instrumentalities sue and the sovereign determined where it can be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.480" offset="1801224">It can be sued in the district in which it was constituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.288" offset="1820450">Now, we take no issue at that until 1933-34.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.617" offset="1853782">In 1933 and 1934 of course, we find as it is commonly called the Roosevelt Legislation concerning the 33 Act, and the 34 Act, the so-called remedial statutes concerning banks and the like and we find that we have a number of cases of Bell against Hood, SEC against Joyner (ph), the remedial statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.336" offset="2020652">We go all the way down to Affiliated Youth case, which was decided only recently, SEC against Capital Gains Bureau, the idea that the remedial statutes be broadly and non-restrictively interpreted.</text>

            <text syncTime="494.707" offset="2082197">Mr. Sands is there anything in the legislative history that shows that Congress actually considered national banks at the time of the enactment of the Securities Acts?</text>

            <text syncTime="504.103" offset="2119709">Mr. Justice Blackmun I say yes, emphatically yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.887" offset="2138830">The national banks in 33 and 34 were under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.784" offset="2158474">There is a senate report, which is referred to in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.183" offset="2176029">The SEC has referred to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.841" offset="2182716">The Control has referred to it, as well, as we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.017" offset="2195359">The problems of national banks were divided in our analysis in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.191" offset="2220123">One; the necessity to protect the investors and the deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.274" offset="2236424">We all remember the run on the Bank of United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.716" offset="2254187">Direct my question, however, to the venue provisions?</text>

          <turn speaker="ira_jay_sands" startTime="540.664" stopTime="1249.993">
            <label>Mr. Ira Jay Sands</label>
            <text syncTime="540.664" offset="2265994">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.801" offset="2270487">There is nothing precise Mr. Justice Blackmun that we have been able to locate, which indicated that the Congress considered the venue provision of national banks at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.471" offset="2317194">We can only reason from our incisiveness, which we hope is accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.410" offset="2336943">In that there is decisional law, which indicates that Congress knows every statute on the subject when it legislates.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.345" offset="2392740">Congress did set-up the Glass-Steagall Act to concern itself basically with protection of depositors, protection of the bank itself in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.496" offset="2433282">Congress set-up the 33 and 34 Act in which it did not set forth any exceptions, whatever, to the venue provision with regard to any actions concerning the 33 and 34 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.130" offset="2499842">There is no legislative history that the precise question was ever discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.157" offset="2519905">It is merely by inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.752" offset="2538295">Now, our position is that there is no reason for implied repeal, although the facts as they approach would give us the effect of the implied repeal, if we would like to, but judicially we are constrained to say that both may exist together if that is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.438" offset="2657100">Now, our interpretation of these Acts would leave both fully intact in securities matters, the plaintiff and the commission would have its choice of venue, in non-securities matters or except as Mr. Justice Rehnquist aptly pointed out in other matters where there maybe specific statutory language, one would have to follow the Bank Act of 64.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.145" offset="2755947">Now, Congress did exempt in the 33 and 34 Act when it is so desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.265" offset="2784368">There were certain definite exemptions in Levin against Great Western Sugar Company, which was a District Court of New Jersey case which started the Third Circuit run of matters that indicated that there was a wider venue than did the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.929" offset="2867020">The judge said, “A quick examination of the 33 and 34 Acts reveal that on a number of the cases the legislative draftsman found fit to exempt national banks and their securities from provisions of the act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="704.379" offset="2920832">And then, he cites 15 U.S.C. 77 (c), 15 U.S.C. 77 (l),” etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.729" offset="2946223">It becomes clear that the legislative draftsman knew about national banks, when writing the securities acts and knew how to exempt them from provisions of the acts, when they chose to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.494" offset="2985302">It would be a new usurpation of legislative prerogatives for this Court to impute an exception to the 34 Act in view of the background just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.304" offset="3024486">Now, the Chicago Bank as amicus in its brief admits that there are exceptions for United States Banks, for National Banks and for the United States government from the registration requirements of the 3 (a) (2) of the 33 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.138" offset="3087911">The Controller admits that as well on page 6 and again on page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.902" offset="3114974">In this Court, in Carnation against Pacific Conference in 1965, quoted United States against Borden, which is 308 US to this effect, “If Congress had desire to grant any further immunity, Congress doubtless would have said so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="773.256" offset="3196371">The courts have in addition carved out additional immunities from the 1864 venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.901" offset="3226882">For instance, this Court in 1968, in Great American Insurance against United States carved down an exception for a claim being filed by a national bank in the Court of Claims and said that the national bank must go to another district where the Court of Claims were sitting in a particular matter, in order to file its claim and the national bank there said, “But you are taking us out of the district that the 1964 Act required.”</text>
            <text syncTime="810.104" offset="3343702">This Court said, “No, if you are filing the claim under the Court of Claims Act you must go to that district, where that matter is now pending.”</text>
            <text syncTime="818.862" offset="3378811">In transfers under the JPML, which happen all the time, the JPML has consistently said to national banks, “You must follow along the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.631" offset="3429802">You are not protected in any manner by the 1864 venue to have a separate bifurcated pre-trial in your own district.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.692" offset="3486122">You must follow the case and of course, you come back later on after the pre-trial is concluded” and we have that in such cases Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, Great Western Ranches, Len Turner (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="857.646" offset="3533873">We have that in Westec.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.172" offset="3544009">Now, we have another rule, which has been followed by the District Courts, I have not found authority that it has come up here and that is concerning the impleaded third party, where a national bank is impleaded as a third party and then says, “Wait, I can only be sued in my own District.”</text>
            <text syncTime="876.564" offset="3609524">The District Courts, the Circuit Courts, we have a Fifth Circuit, Lone Star Package against Baltimore and Ohio Railroad said and there were others, said, “No, if you are a third party impleaded defendant, you must go to the district, where the action is being litigated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="895.379" offset="3684861">Basically, the reasoning behind that I believe has been judicial economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.869" offset="3702833">We can just visualize the number of different bifurcated trials that would result if the banks had that cloak of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.419" offset="3733031">Now, I do not, in fact I insist that the Congress did not in 1864 give the banks a cloak of immunity, but the Congress as the sovereign in 1863 and 1864 opened the field, opened the wall of sovereign immunity and gave us permission to sue national banks at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.409" offset="3820907">And then, in 1934 the Congress again opened the wall of immunity, because of the overriding concern for the populous involved in the securities frauds.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.284" offset="3868450">So, it is not a question by which our national banks have for 30 years impressed the lower Courts that they are protected, that there is immunity, that the statute was made for their protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.173" offset="3936055">I say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.597" offset="3941697">I say the 1864 statute was made to permit the banks to be sued, not to protect the banks from all suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.922" offset="3975029">The 1934 statute was enacted to permit banks to be sued a little more widely in a more practical sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.044" offset="4027483">Now, there is no reason why both of these interesting statutes may not live together, may not be supplementary, may not each be fully effective, they certainly can co-exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.844" offset="4086729">We found that in the Robertson case 422 U.S., where we had two Acts, which permitted to co-exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.234" offset="4136257">This Court has frequently admonished the lower Courts to attempt to prevent conflict in statutes, achieve the aim of the 1934 Act of Merrill Lynch against Ware, not many years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.331" offset="4192682">We have been admonished to interpret statutes by practical experience and practical experience certainly would permit the banks to be sued in a securities-related matter, in the same district where everyone else is Aaron Boyle against United States in ‘72.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.144" offset="4263944">Now, even going back to these interesting old cases, such as Red Rock against Henry, unless the Acts are completely repugnant keep them both alive and we have a long line of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.054" offset="4319532">In Wilmot against Mudge, which is 103 U.S. back in 1880, this Court said that both statutes can be said to have their own spheres of operation, if both can stand by any reasonable construction, that construction must be adapted, the basic tenant of law in this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.131" offset="4403856">We have an interesting case 1846 Beals against Hale and there this Court discussed a parliamentary example, where parliament said that a particular crime was punishable at Assizes Court and then, parliament subsequently allowed another Court to have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.276" offset="4488388">This Court stated that examples like that, you must reconcile them, they both must exist and the government in a particular situation like that would have a choice of either forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.221" offset="4548156">Now, in the Posadas case, Posadas against National City Bank, which my learned brother has attempted to interpret against us, this Court said in 1936 that we must seek to interpret the new statute as a continuation of the old statute whenever possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.510" offset="4629345">There certainly has been no statement in any statute or in any interpretation by this Court that a previous Act may not be enlarged, that a venue may not be enlarged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.096" offset="4707712">The United States both carries against U.S., 400 U.S. 351 in 1971, which concerned seamen wages and the old law was that the shipping commissioners would determine any problem of seaman's wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.186" offset="4776048">Then, came a modern law, which set-up the Labor Management Relations Act, a very modern procedure, but it did not repeal the old.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.903" offset="7698941">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.935" offset="7715033">I am here appearing for the respondent First National Bank of Boston only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.391" offset="7740842">At the outset I would like to set the record straight in the posture of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.729" offset="7766233">Before the lower courts, the only issue raised by petitioner in this case was one of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.491" offset="7809282">The allegations of this complaint, a charge that there has been a violation of Section 10 (b), the New York State statute and the common law and that arose out of the latest issue and some false misleading statements by TelePrompter Inc, which have been developed as a result as a formal complaint and investigation by the SEC, where upon a class action was brought in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.622" offset="7921818">The plaintiff purported to bring the action under the venue provisions of Section 27 of the Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.938" offset="7955046">That complaint does not allege that the bank which was the agent bank in a $150 million credit loan agreement had anything to do with the latest issue of the false statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.141" offset="8023905">It does not allege that the bank purchased and sold TelePrompter stock or that made any profit out of any of the transactions complained off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.667" offset="8073955">The basis of jurisdiction and the cause of action against the bank, as I see it and I am not sure that I am right is that the bank is a alleged to have aided and abet the other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.674" offset="8129962">And, it reached this fiduciary obligations to the investing public, because it did not disclose to the SEC, to the New York Stock Exchange and the public generally some information which it had learned as a lending bank and which is alleged to be inconsistent with the statements issued by the TelePrompter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.405" offset="8224943">Where upon, relying upon this Court’s decisions in Langdeau and Robertson, which makes mandatory the application of Section 94, we moved under as Rule 12 and Section 94 to dismiss for lack of proper venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.143" offset="8299862">At this point Your Honors, may I say, I want to make our position perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.617" offset="8325776">We are not saying that the Exchange Act does not apply to a national bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.655" offset="8349913">We are saying only that the venue must be laid in the District where the bank is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.346" offset="8380737">Whatever rights the petitioner may have here, he can pursue in the District of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.777" offset="8414383">Now, petitioner has conceded that the bank is established in Boston and indeed as it has been since 1864, right after the National Banking Act was put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.377" offset="8476868">And, he conceded in his affidavit, which appears at page 77 (a) of the appendix, that under normal circumstances, Section 94 of the National Bank Act would prevent a bank foreign to this meaningless Southern District from being sued in the Southern District, but they argued because the bank had qualified under Section 131 (3) of the New York Banking law to engage in a limited fiduciary capacity in its activities in New York that constituted an in test waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.337" offset="8640708">Now, this was the issue which was before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.569" offset="8665576">The District Court found as a fact that there have been no waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.946" offset="8687101">Petitioner appealed to the Second Circuit, again on the issue of waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="2184.334" offset="8840701">There is not one word of implied repeal or repeal by implication.</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.681" offset="8918024">And then, when it was mentioned by counsel for the petitioner, he did not urge that as a basis for an implied repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.327" offset="8968597">He did not rely upon it on that basis at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2366.337" offset="9568682">At the time of the argument, before the Second Circuit, Judge Mulligan, who was the presiding judge turned to Mr. Gatley (ph) and said, “Counsel, are you suggesting that this court reconsider or overrule its decision in Bruns against Nordeman and Mr. Gatley responded in the negative that he was not asking that that be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2434.147" offset="9839937">Granted there maybe some inconvenience, granted there may be some hardship, but in this case, I submit that the hardship is much, much less than it was in Michigan National Bank against Robertson and if we are going to decide that repeal by implication is to be determined by the hardship, it would concrete of the decisions that have come down from this Court in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="2637.816" offset="10654540">Clearly Section 27 does not by its express terms repeal Section 94, nor did Congress say as petitioner has asserted in his reply brief that enacting the 34 Act and I quote, “Congress intended that a National Bank in the Securities’ case could be sued in certain, specified additional Act districts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.128" offset="10775852">Petitioner admittedly get no help from the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.567" offset="10797586">He has acknowledged this morning that he can make only an implicit argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.781" offset="10822455">What he argues that the two statues can co-exist, but the principal thrust of his opening argument seems to be that the implied repeal of Section 94 can be found, because the broad public interest at the time of the enactment of Securities Act required it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.141" offset="10907927">The 1934 Congress was consumer concerned that the 1934 Act was meant to supersede any earlier conflicting statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.804" offset="10962576">But suffice, we are able to ascertain nothing supports these assertions except the (Inaudible) of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.298" offset="11008551">But they go even farther at page 16 of the opening brief and they say, “Congress' silence evidences its intent in 1934 to impose the venue provisions of the 1934 Act on all concerned.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.719" offset="11094233">We can find no case from this or any other court, which supports the thesis that silence, will support implied repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.565" offset="11141567">However, as Mr. Sands has acknowledged this morning, the SEC in its brief makes a completely different argument, saying that the adherence to the decisions of the Second and Ninth Circuits would frustrate the policy of the ‘34 Act and would have an adverse effect upon the enforcement activities of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.551" offset="11241563">I would remind this Court that the 1934 Act has been in effect for 42 years, yet the commission in its brief does not cite a single instance where a resort by a National Bank to the provisions of Section 94 as evinced upon or interfered or adversely affected the Commission’s enforcement activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.737" offset="11346262">The sole justification advanced in support of this thesis is that the Commission may be unable some day to join some National Bank in some unidentified future enforcement procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.412" offset="11420972">An argument was made just ten years ago, before the Southern District of New York in an action entitled General Electric Credit Corporation against (Inaudible), where the Commission again filed an amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.690" offset="11494115">The Department of Justice representing the Controller of Currency took an opposite point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.407" offset="11528910">Judge Tanny made a very careful survey of the situation and he came to the conclusion that there was nothing to support the conclusion of implied repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.455" offset="11589096">Now, in somewhat different context, but I submit a similar situation, Mr. Justice White in writing for this Court said in Mercantile National Bank, that this was a problem for Congress to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.088" offset="11679689">It was not a problem for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.780" offset="11694422">One would have thought had been in fact an interference with the Commission's enforcement activities during the last 40 years that they would have gone to Congress and sought help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.304" offset="11748548">They have not been reluctant to do so in the past, but they have not done so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.264" offset="11784388">Whatever maybe the speculative views of petitioner as to the intentions of Congress or whatever the SEC believes are the controlling policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.526" offset="11845410">We have been unable to find any support in any decisions from this Court, which will sustain an argument for implied repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.166" offset="11892012">To the contrary, this Court consistently taken the view that absent a waiver by a bank, the Section 94 mandates that all transitory actions shall be brought only in the district where the bank is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.057" offset="11963588">In order to sustain implied repeal, there are two cardinal precepts as we read the cases, which must be undertaken and established by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.009" offset="12019385">One; there must be a clear and manifest intent to repeal and two; there must be a positive repugnance or an irreconcilable conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.187" offset="12100051">We find neither of those present in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.670" offset="12130040">There is nothing to support in our judgment, clear and manifest intent to repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.843" offset="12170687">In an effort to buttress the arguments of the petitioner and its own arguments, the SEC in its brief refers to the report of Senator Fletcher of the Senate banking and currency committee and says that this sustains the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.631" offset="12261802">I submit that the Fletcher report is completely irrelevant to this arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.288" offset="12284476">It was not submitted to the Senate of the United States until after the 34 Act had become law and it made no recommendations of any kind with respect to immediate legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.142" offset="12343931">Now, certainly at the time that the 1934 Act was adopted, Congress was aware and this is conceded by petitioner, of the special status which Congress has granted to national banks, going back to 1864.</text>

            <text syncTime="3108.254" offset="12536296">It is quite true that the Congress was concerned about abuses which have been developing and existed in the Securities industry, but they were also well aware of the special status of national banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="3136.497" offset="12649354">Well, I suppose one can make that argument, I do not happen to subscribe to it, based upon the decisions which have emanated from this Court, but certainly, conceptually one can make that argument and I would be lacking in candor if I did not acknowledge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.751" offset="12742350">But, I cannot believe that simply by enacting Section 27 and by silence that it can be properly construed that Congress intended to amend or repeal Section 94, but to petitioner it seems to me at more difficult burden in sustaining implied repeal in that he must show positive repugnance or irreconcilable conflict between the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.711" offset="12866171">And, I submit that petitioner has made no attempt at such a showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.435" offset="12889054">In his reply brief at page 3, he concedes that implied repeal is more difficult to establish, than what he terms co-existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.323" offset="12936597">I think it might have been might be a little accurate if he had said it was impossible, under these circumstances to establish implied repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.244" offset="12980273">And then, on the next page of his reply brief, that is on page 4, under the heading, the two venue statutes are supplementary and not in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.336" offset="13024682">He apparently abandons any effort at showing repugnance and he characterizes this as the major point of his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.761" offset="13070344">He said this morning there is no reason why they cannot co-exist, a position which is diametrically opposed to that of the SEC, which pep the entire brief that it submitted as amicus in establishing that there was repugnance and a direct conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.521" offset="13165429">I submit that when petitioner is talking about harmonization of the two statues that you can make them each effective in its own sphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.204" offset="13220182">He is engaged in, if I may use a colloquialism, kidding himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.160" offset="13251947">He asserts that each special statutes is a special grant by Congress to a forum and that more than one statutes applies, a plaintiff has the benefit of both and he can make his choice, that is of Section 27 or Section 94.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.517" offset="13337420">With respect that I suggest that if that were the law, and in the situation there would be no need for us to be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.725" offset="13374200">I would suggest also that even if he is correct, the fact that he may make the choice does not mean that he is going to be able to stay in that forum, because Section 1404 (a) of the judicial code is still in the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.538" offset="13445462">It my well be that a defendant can invoke the provisions of that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.735" offset="13474301">I submit that petitioner is really not asking for harmonization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.727" offset="13494259">He is asking for an exception, an implied repeal Section 94, where Securities Act law violations are charged and he would equate such exception to that exception recognized by this Court with respect to purely local actions in Cassey against Adams (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.759" offset="13582344">As I have indicated and as Mr. Sands agrees, the Commission that is not on the Court with petitioner's view is that the two statutes can co-exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.358" offset="13628737">Rather he argues that the two venues statutes are in direct and irreconcilable conflict and the Section 27 supersedes Section 94.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.318" offset="13676593">It says that they are repugnant in both their policies and their practical effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.594" offset="13701671">However, he does concede that if Section 94 prevails then bank can be sued only in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.024" offset="13743362">It seems to me that by making such concession, it is an overt admission that the Exchange Act can be made to work against the bank in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.601" offset="13793727">Now, in attempting to establish repugnance, the Commission relies on two cases decided by this Court only last June.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.890" offset="13830925">Gordon against New York Stock Exchange and United States against NASD.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.712" offset="13858197">He argues that Section 94 has been impliedly repealed by Section 27, because such repeal is necessary in this case to make the federal record choice scheme work in the Securities industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.670" offset="13917965">In that regard, it seems to me that the Commission overlooks Silver against the New York Stock Exchange, which says that if there is repeal by implication, it will be granted only to the extent necessary to make the act work and then, only to the minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.337" offset="13996646">But, those two cases if the Court please, I submit are distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.645" offset="14029873">In each of those cases the requirements of implied repeal had been clearly satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.514" offset="14061325">In order to make the regulatory scheme work as envisioned by Congress with respect to fixed rate commissions and with respect to the sales and distribution of mutual funds, this Court held that the anti-trust laws have to give way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.505" offset="14137289">There was no way to reconcile the restrictive agreements, which were developed in the Securities industry with the anti-trust laws, the scheme that been envisaged by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.262" offset="14196326">But, there is nothing in the case at Bar, which makes these holdings opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.829" offset="14222657">As I said earlier the substantive provisions of this law can work in Boston as well as they can in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.332" offset="14248675">The bank is not immune from the terms of the securities laws nor is it exempt from potential liability that violates the terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.146" offset="14295905">We say only that the issue whether it violated the term should be determined in the District of Massachusetts rather in the District of New York.</text>
