            <text syncTime="14.381" offset="160831">Yesterday, during my argument, I had pointed out that the fulcrum of federal employees of Article 2, Section 2 of the Constitution where there are two types of employees referred to and the two together cover all federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.150" offset="239930">One is those officers who are confirmed by the Senate and the other consists of all the remaining officers or officials or employees of the Federal Government and that constitutional provision authorizes Congress to delegate the power of employing those individuals to the Executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.967" offset="331150">Congress did that in Section 3101 and in doing so, limited those employees to persons who are paid out of appropriated funds and of course the Exchange Service Employees are not.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.073" offset="491646">Certainly that is true, but when you go from inferior officers to just employees, there are a couple of old cases from this Court that talk about one man who was appointed by an assistant surgeon or something like that may say he is just an employee, he is not under the Appointments Clause at all?</text>

            <text syncTime="140.057" offset="663532">The Government argues that Section 2105 (c) indicates that Congress has extended the concept of federal employees to the Exchange Service and I pointed out yesterday that in addition to being contrary to Article 2, Section 2, that statutory provision does not do so, although it does in that provision in several others, apply certain principles which are generally applied to federal employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.867" offset="938758">It would end the case because the only reason why these employees would not have an enforceable contract of employment is because Butler said inferior officers or public officials do not have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.919" offset="1006990">So if the Exchange Service employees are not in the category contemplated by Butler then there is a contract of employment which can be enforced and the 1970 Amendment to the Tucker Act would clearly apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.141" offset="1059862">So there are cases which say that employees of the United States do not operate or they are not under a contract, it is not a contractual arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.105" offset="1095702">If you are not an employee of the United States, the usual jurisprudence it that it is a contractual employment and that is what you argue?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="259.201" offset="1140110">Other very important question in this case whether the 1970 Amendment granted rights with respect to employees or put it broadly people working for the government or whether it was intended to be limited to contractors with the government suppliers, is that not really a fulcrum of this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_h_mcgrail" startTime="282.375" stopTime="554.631">
            <label>Mr. Thomas H. McGrail</label>
            <text syncTime="282.375" offset="1232792">Yes, it is also.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.598" offset="1237703">The contention by the Government that the amendment was intended to apply only to suppliers is not supported by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.169" offset="1275946">The Government asks or says there is no reference to PX employees in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.216" offset="1304159">It so happens there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.793" offset="1310533">There is no reference, however, in the Senate Report or the House Report or the debate to supply contractors, although the PX’s deal with billions of dollars a year in supplies which they sell at retail, there is no reference to any suppliers in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.678" offset="1406036">Now, the reference to the employees in the legislative history is the Keetz case which is a very significant case and the Borden case, not just one employee case, but two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.485" offset="1461207">Congress in both reports said, there is a gap or a loophole in the course jurisdiction formed by Borden, Keetz, Pulaski, and Kyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.004" offset="1511362">Two were employee cases; two were personal service cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.692" offset="1534036">The Government suggests that Congress did not understand what those cases were about.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.361" offset="1552740">I submit it is elemental and statutory construction that we assume Congress knew what it was doing and these bills came out of the Judiciary Committee composed of lawyers, and furthermore, Trial Judge Spector of the Court of Claims was a witness before the Committee on behalf of the American Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.473" offset="1645213">Mr. Spector was formerly Chairman of the Armed Service Board of Contract Appeals and is recognized as one of the leading authorities on federal contract and employee law, and he did refer to, in his statement presented to the Committee, he did refer to the employee situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.425" offset="1729014">As a matter of fact, he pointed out there is a difference between PX employees who have a contract and regular federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.975" offset="1759212">At the March 4, 1969 hearings at Page 10, he stated, regular civilian employees of the government, unlike those of non-appropriated fund activities are not employed by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.749" offset="1814278">Thus, he is saying to the Committee, PX employees have a contract, federal employees do not and he cited the Bouchea case which unfortunately is not cited in the briefs, but is cited at Page 10 of those hearings which was an employee of the PX who was fired or demoted and he went to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, and they did not turn him down because he did not have a contract relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.731" offset="1918245">They turned him down because their jurisdiction is limited to contracts where there is a standard government disputes clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.606" offset="1953772">Everyone recognized that there was a contract relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.852" offset="1966729">In the Keetz case which is one of the four cases that the Congress relied on in passing this legislation, the Government took the very strong position that Exchange Service Employees have contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.941" offset="2027124">It argued and I quote, “It is patently not true that the claim is not founded on contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="489.385" offset="2060874">It is patently not true the Government said at that time that the Exchange Service Employees’ relationship was not founded in contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.881" offset="2102879">The Court of Claims picked that case up in this case, the Hopkins case below, and referred to the fact the Government has previously taken the position that they have contracts of employment and stated, we find it a bit ironic that in the instant case, the Government argues just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.413" offset="2168916">We can only assume that this inconsistency has occurred because the enactment of Public Law 91350 now grants jurisdiction for Exchange Contract Employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.596" offset="2205697">We, the Court of Claims speaking in this case, we hold the Government’s contract area in Keetz to be correct and see no reason to change in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.032" offset="2247388">Why did Congress pass the 1970 Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="538.895" offset="2258882">Because the Court of Claims in Borden, and Keetz and in Kyer said there is a harsh result here.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.056" offset="2287512">These people have no Court to go to, and the Senate and House both said that is why we are passing this legislation.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="554.631" offset="2321785">That is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.463" offset="2329204">Those statements of the Court of Claims are entirely consistent with what the sponsor of the bill said in describing it as under the Tiding statements I am referring to where he said that this amendment will provide the contractors, the people who are selling goods and services to non-appropriated fund agencies, with the means of suit and remedy and omission.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.185" offset="2480087">The reference to employees is through the Keetz case and the Borden case and through Mr. Spector’s statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.157" offset="2503911">But I think Mr. Justice Stevens in his comment yesterday may have pointed to the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.228" offset="2536198">Congress was aware that these employees had contracts,;it was aware that there were personal service contracts with the Exchange Service, and obviously was aware that there were billions of dollars of supply contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.209" offset="2592100">It did not isolate in its reports Supply Contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.473" offset="2613207">It just referred to contracts and contractors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.042" offset="5311447">And Congress recognized this, was aware of this when it passed the 1970 Amendment and stated its strong positions that it wanted to close this gap formed by Keetz as completely as possible so there would be no opportunity and I now quote from the Senate report “which would ultimately serve to create additional loopholes through which clever defendants may ultimately retreat and to the anachronism of the governmental immunity that the bill seeks to eradicate.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.268" offset="5632335">Just two points, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.238" offset="5672250">Respondent tells us that the terms and conditions of his employment in the Exchange Service derived from contract, but when asked to provide the basis for the contract or to provide the terms or the relations for the contract, he turns inevitably to the regulations governing employment in the Exchange Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.655" offset="5777889">I would point out that these regulations not only were unilaterally changed during the course of respondent’s employment, but the very terms and conditions, the very regulations that respondent in his complaint before the Court of Claims asserted were violated or were breached were not enforced in effect at the commencements of his employment in 1958 with the Exchange Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.783" offset="5894395">Therefore, the employment status of this employee like other Exchange Service employees really turns within or comes within the Butler principle and that principle does not turn upon labels as to who is or who is not a federal employee, because we know that for certain purposes, Exchange Service Employees are deemed federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.949" offset="6007140">I pointed out yesterday that there are statutes in which Congress has expressly brought them within that definition for other purposes, they are outside that definite of federal employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.744" offset="6046324">The term federal employee is not the touchstone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.436" offset="6057086">The question rather is whether under the Butler principal, the employment relationship with the government is derived entirely as here from regulations or statutes which must be capable of uniform or unilateral change as public policy requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.515" offset="6133364">In traditional contract terminology, there would be no contract simply because there is no mutual obligation to be bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.089" offset="6171711">In fact, even as between private parties an agreement such as this or such as respondent wants to create would --</text>
