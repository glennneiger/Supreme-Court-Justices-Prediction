            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="54.747" offset="322291">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.448" offset="333158">This case which is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit presents the same issue as the last case with respect to the need of federal instrumentalities to obtain state permits, except it arises under the 1972 Amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.492" offset="413302">The operative language is the same except for the addition of six words that I will come to later.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.738" offset="438275">Section 313 of the Water Act like Section 118 of the Air Act requires that federal instrumentalities comply with the state requirements respecting control and abatement of pollution to the same extent that any person is subject to such requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.794" offset="514552">Because of some differences between the statutes however, I would like briefly to outline to the Court, the regulatory scheme under the Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.737" offset="554258">Prior to 1972, the Federal program for the control of water pollution was based mainly upon the development by the States of what are called water quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.199" offset="612146">That is a general standard as to the level of pollutants that would be permissible within water and the Federal enforcement role was rather limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.301" offset="656554">The 1972 Amendments marked a dramatic shift in the emphasis and the method by which water pollution was to be controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.888" offset="694902">Instead of stressing primarily the quality of the water generally, the Act decided to deal with what is called point source pollution, the specific individual, the specific firm that is polluting and the focus was on what I call technology-based limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.915" offset="775045">That is trying to devise the best technology possible in order to reduce the pollutants that each particular point source makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.277" offset="820394">And this particular technique, the control of the point source pollutants was to be accomplished through a permit system.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.677" offset="858010">So that this case is unlike the other case and that, in the other case there was no reference at all to anything about permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.662" offset="886014">In this case there is an explicit scheme for permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.054" offset="907538">Now, what the statute does is it requires that the Environmental Protection Agency to develop nationwide standards, standards for effluent limitations for point source pollutants in various industries, it is on industry by industry basis and for example, they might have a standard that for cement plant, the cement plant cannot discharge more than a certain amount of phosphate for each hundred tons of cement produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.553" offset="1029583">It is that kind of thing to determine the maximum permissible pollutants from each particular source.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.468" offset="1065214">And it is made illegal under Section 301 of the act for any person to discharge pollutants into any navigable waters except in compliance with the effluent limitations that the Federal Agency has developed for the particular sources except in compliance with the general water quality standards that the Federal Government and the States have developed and except in compliance with the permit provisions of Section 402 which has created something called the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.077" offset="1207633">And under that system, EPA has undertaken decisions required to issue permits to an individual discharges as long as those discharges meet the standards it has provided for effluent dischargers.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.435" offset="1273044">And to date, it is issued more than 30,000 of these permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.886" offset="1286836">That is, the Federal agency has issued more than 30,000 of these permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.834" offset="1302719">The Act further provides however that a State may itself submit a plan under which it will issue permits and if the State’s permit plan needs a large variety of specified conditions in the statute as well as meeting the general standards then the administrator of the EPA is directed to approve it and once he approves it that under the statute automatically terminates his authority to continue to issue permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.337" offset="1432704">And, thus far the administrator of the EPA has approved 27 different state plans for state issuance of permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.146" offset="1483904">The EPA has issued rather detailed regulations governing the state to permit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.924" offset="1506996">And one of those regulations which is at issue in this case is that plans that he approves for State permit programs do not cover agencies and instrumentalities of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.728" offset="1562272">This case arose out of these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.282" offset="1576482">The States of California and Washington submitted to the EPA their plans for a programed permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.782" offset="1610441">EPA approved those plans but indicated in each instance that the plan did not cover permits for federal facilities and that the administrator would therefore continue to issue permits for federal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.193" offset="1676061">In accordance with the provisions of the statute the States then took this ruling to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which held that under this statute the administrator has no authority to deny the States the right to issue permits for Federal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.705" offset="1750144">The arguments that I have just made under the Clean Air Act are, we think equally applicable to this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.133" offset="1783894">Section 313, obviously was modeled upon Section 118.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.097" offset="1811689">The legislative history of this section like that of Section 118, again reflects repeated emphasis that what the Federal authorities ought to comply with are the State emissions standards, the substantive things, the effluent limitations, same requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.699" offset="1898102">There is nothing in this history like that under the Clean Air Act that indicates Congress was intending to require federal facilities to obtain State permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.221" offset="1948257">Now, there is one distinction between the language of Section 313 and the language of 118, which both the Court of Appeals and the States of California and Washington argue calls for different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.802" offset="2006562">This is a provision which where after the statute says that they shall comply with State and Federal requirements to the same extent as any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.390" offset="2044910">It then adds the phrase including the payment of reasonable service charges.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.154" offset="2115963">And also the suggestion that if the Court were to agree with us in the Kentucky case, it could go the other way in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.394" offset="2144907">The argument is made --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="511.343" offset="2148668">I thought vice versa, very well, yes, if the Court could agree with you, we should agree with you --.</text>

          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="515.474" stopTime="900.975">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="515.474" offset="2165178">If they hold it there is no authority to acquire permits under the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.192" offset="2180120">Now, the argument is that the words, including the payment of reasonable service charges refers to charges that the State might impose for issuing permits and that since a permit might be viewed in the nature of attacks, Congress inserted this provision, in order to make it clear that the Federal facilities could pay for the State permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.189" offset="2276041">We think to the contrary that what this refers to is to make it clear that the Federal facilities will have to comply with any State requirements relating of treatment of waste materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.913" offset="2338944">In this statute there are number of provisions which provide for vast Federal funding and research into the development of adequate local waste treatment facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.763" offset="2386383">And the charges for those facilities are naturally extensive and we think what Congress intended in this provision was that if a State should conclude as part of its plan, that waste material would have to be processed through a local treatment facility, that the federal instrumentalities would have to comply with that and they would have to pay reasonable charges therefore, not any charge is the State, surfeit to impose but reasonable charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.329" offset="2516681">I am told that the fees for permits are relatively modest.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.698" offset="2534131">An average permit fee may sometimes be $25.00 to $50.00 and State of Washington which is the respondent here makes no charge for a permit fees and it seems most unlikely that Congress was concerned about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.069" offset="2583659">Much more probable in the light of this whole statute it seems to us is that Congress wanted to make it clear that in complying with the Federal standards, in complying, I am sorry, in complying with the State standards Federal facilities would, if the State required compliance and going through the local waste treatment plants would have to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.357" offset="2676760">Now, here again, and under this statute as under the Clean Air Act, there are number of provisions within the statute itself, which we think are inconsistent with the view that Congress intended to require the Federal facilities to get the State permits, which once again as I just mentioned and that is why I want to repeat it, require him to get the State permit means, the State can tell him how to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.418" offset="2785011">For example, there are several provisions which authorize the States to adopt certain procedures and certain standards except with respect to point sources of pollution owned or operated by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.563" offset="2849586">One example is Section 308 which provides and requires that permits to be approvable must have detailed provisions governing, monitoring, inspection and entry on to plants, obviously designed to ensure that there is compliance with the substantive standards contained in the permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.632" offset="2933909">The statute however explicitly provides that the State standards are not applicable to Government facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.390" offset="2964943">Now, once again it seems rather unlikely to us that if Congress intended to give the States the authority to require Federal facilities, to obtain permits and then turned around and said to the States, you have got to have in your plans adequate provisions for monitoring and inspection to make sure that your permit holders are complying with these standards, and at the same time would have said, but you cannot do this with respect to Federal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.637" offset="3093883">It is all part of the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.070" offset="3099630">If the inspection and monitoring is that important for compliance and if the Federal facilities were intended to have to get State permits it seems clear to us, Congress would have said and the Federal facilities also are subject to these inspection requirements but Congress did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.495" offset="3181341">There is a similar thing with respect to so-called new sources of pollution and the statute is explicit that the United States must meet the new sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.114" offset="3223764">Once again, the Environmental Protection Agency may authorize the States to apply and enforce their own standards of performance for new sources, if they equal the Federal standards except for new sources owned or operated by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.005" offset="3295339">Here too, we think it most unlikely that if Congress had intended to require and authorize the States to issue permits for Federal facilities it would have denied the States the authority to enforce those permits against Federal facilities where the very standards sought to be enforced of those contained in the permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.374" offset="3396799">We have set forth in our briefs a number of other examples and instances in which the whole statutory scheme, the use of the language, the way it structured the various provisions seem to us inconsistent with the notion that when it used these general words to comply with the requirements respecting pollution of States, Federal and local sources that Congress intended thereby to give the States in effect what amounts to a veto power over the operation of Federal facilities, usually on Federal land within the State unless, the State decides that it wishes to authorize the Federal facilities so to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.835" offset="3578716">Once again, as in the Clean Air Act we think something much more explicit and specific is required than what we have in either this language or in this legislative history which -- I reiterate again, indicates that what Congress was concerned about was the effluent limitations and not the procedures that the State might device in order to achieve compliance with those requirements by the private firms and people within the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.888" offset="3742869">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.664" offset="3753945">The Solicitor General argues in this case that this case is very similar to the Kentucky case.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.244" offset="3776306">However, in one fundamental respect our case is very different from the Kentucky case and that is that our case has a specific permit provision in Section 402 of the Water Act that is applicable to all dischargers.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.874" offset="3826879">Thus there is expressed authority in the Water Act for States and the administrator himself issue permits to discharges and that -- as that authorities found in Section 402 of the Water Act and thus the only issue on the Court is whether the States have authority to apply this permits to federal dischargers.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.321" offset="3900649">So there is a fundamental difference between this case and the Kentucky case in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.126" offset="3919875">And the administrator argues that Section 313 which imposes an obligation on Federal dischargers to comply with all the requirements under the Act does not include permits under Section 402.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.065" offset="3971597">Now, that result would lead to a very illogical result especially as applied to the administrator’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.614" offset="4001795">For the administrator concedes that federal dischargers have to comply with permits which he, the administrator himself issues in States where he operates his own NPDES permit program.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.375" offset="4048815">Well, what is the source that obligation, where does the administrator himself get authority to issue permits to federal dischargers.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.656" offset="4073997">That authority has to be found in Section 313 of the Water Act because that is the only provision in the Water Act that defines the obligation of federal dischargers under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.498" offset="4109315">And that section specifically provides that federal dischargers must comply with both State requirements and Federal requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.378" offset="4136796">And therefore the word requirements in 313 must include Section 402 permits or otherwise the administrator himself would lack authority to issue permits to Federal dischargers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.182" offset="4180054">And under that result of course federal dischargers would be entirely exempt from the 402 permit provisions of the Act and the administrator himself in this case has conceded that that is not the result to be implied that Congress indeed intended for federal dischargers to comply with the 402 permit program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.367" offset="4248809">And thus the administrator’s position results in a very difficult dilemma which the administrator has yet failed to address in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.240" offset="4276289">Either the word requirement includes Section 402 permits or it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.604" offset="4297710">And if it does, it must include permits issued by the States and if it does not, the administrator himself lacks authority to issue permits to federal dischargers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.398" offset="4344939">Now, the Court asked a number of questions in the Kentucky case that I think are partially applicable at least to the issues in this Court, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.200" offset="4384123">First, Justice Burger, Marshall and Blackmun asked the question of why does the State have authority or need authority to issue permits to federal dischargers?</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.761" offset="4418396">Well, the answer in our case is that the permit process itself is the very process by which an effluent limitation is developed with respect to a federal discharger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.509" offset="4461341">The permit process is the process which enables the State to get the necessary information it needs to define the effluent limitation to be imposed on the discharger himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.748" offset="4498330">There is a number of questions that have to be asked of these dischargers and we have to get answers from them, for instance, what are the --</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.851" offset="8386709">This is consistent, I would like to go back if I can and walk through several sections of the Statute and just a bit of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.655" offset="8417952">Up in the 1970 of course as the Solicitor and we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.775" offset="8434461">Only the States could issue permits in water pollution control matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.188" offset="8456090">In 1970, the president discovered the 1899 Refuse Act and the core of engineers begin to issue permits to water polluters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.188" offset="8500081">This of course created a duplicatory and relatively wasteful system besides having the core of Engineers involved in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.812" offset="8526621">Which it was one of the principal designs of the 1972 act to cure, it wanted to get rid of that duplicatory system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.936" offset="8555042">So the Permit System in 402 first says, under 402 (a) EPA issues permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.138" offset="8587852">Second, it says in section 402 (b) and this was expected and it is explicitly listed in the sponsor’s remarks about the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.396" offset="8624946">That as soon as the States met Federal qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.387" offset="8644903">The EPA must approve the State plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.858" offset="8662771">Not may at one point it did say may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.389" offset="8672907">But as the Act that was passed, it said must approve the States plans and under 402 (c) must promptly suspend the issuance of its own permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.737" offset="8714285">Now, 402, we all agree it contains no exemptions for Federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.273" offset="8740407">But during the course of the passage of that Act through Congress at one point it did contain an exemption for Federal agencies from one relatively limited element of section 402.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.318" offset="8792652">But that was not only taken out by the conference committee but the conference committee report shows that it was taken out conscious of the fact that the Federal Government should not have that specific exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.835" offset="8846673">Section 301 refers to persons, the prohibition of section 301 refers to persons and as the basic prohibitory section of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.195" offset="8888156">But Federal agencies are not included within the definition of persons in Section 502, subsection 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.556" offset="8921592">So if it were not for section 313, EPA could not issue permits to federal entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.861" offset="8950745">And of course, neither could States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.951" offset="8959104">Section 313 as my colleague from California has already said is the reason EPA can issue permits as well the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.593" offset="8993690">And it lands them directly together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.919" offset="9002990">It says Federal agencies are to comply with Federal and State requirements respecting control of the abatement of pollution to the same extent that any person is subject to such requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.732" offset="9054294">So the Federal agencies seek 402 (a) permits or 402 (b) permits by a reason of exactly the same authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.256" offset="9092329">And if the word “requirements” in the statute Mr. Chief Justice, is not broad enough to include procedural matters, i.e. State permits under 402 (b) it is not broad enough to include Federal procedural requirement or permits under 402 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.285" offset="9164427">The authority of the EPA and the States are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.486" offset="9181249">Now not only is this a wrong and absurd result because it would free Federal agencies from any obligations to secure any permits at all and because the dictionary definition of the word requirements has to be totally distorted for you to come to that kind of answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.750" offset="9990314">Now, the United States claims that because Federal agencies are expressly exempted from State procedures enforcing new source standards by the terms of 306 (c) of the Act and because Federal agencies are expressly exempted from State procedures for inspection monitoring and entry with respect to point sources within the State by the terms of 308 (c) an exemption from the State permit programs authorized by section 402 (b) has got to be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.539" offset="10113507">Now there are two reasons why this is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.116" offset="10123747">The first is, because each of those exemptions not to mention another in 401 (a) which is irrelevant to this argument and the original house version which was right in section 402 itself and which removed by the conference committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.220" offset="10184247">Each of these shows graphically that the congress know perfectly well how to exempt Federal agencies from specific water control act programs when it wished to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.671" offset="10221968">Not only did it not do so, in either section 402 or 313 it even expunged the partial exemption which originally appeared in section 402 in the House version, and the legislative history, which we shall find noted on page 30 of the California Brief, expressly shows that the conference committee knew exactly what it was doing in taking out that particular exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2585.868" offset="10446830">What the Congress decided was that the State wanted to do a half baked job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.923" offset="10466996">And only control new sources or perhaps only to have an independent inspection system not related to any substantive requirements whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.377" offset="10504822">Congress was not to let the States do that to Federal agencies and that is why they were exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.330" offset="10524675">They wanted to encourage the States to take over the whole program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.350" offset="10540766">This is the point of the entire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.886" offset="10550902">So a State can have a program for new sources only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.024" offset="10563441">It can have an inspection program only but without having a full.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.988" offset="10583294">402 (b) permit system, but it cannot enforce that against the Federal Government because EPA and that same State will still be operating a permit program under 402 (a) and that Congress did not want this kind of duplicatory system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.573" offset="10649645">But once the State took its responsibilities under 402 (b) then Federal agencies fall within it because under the expressed terms of section 402 (b), we must have elements of a new source program under 306 and an inspection and monitoring system covered by section 308.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.260" offset="10744417">And at that point of course the Federal agencies must secure State permits as well as abide by State substantive standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.979" offset="10775241">And so this Act is completely consistent throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.533" offset="10789452">Just as the State cannot require Federal agencies to abide by fragmented States program and to create a dual or duplicatory system while EPA is still issuing permits under section 402 (a), So EPA cannot create a dual or parallel permit program like harping Federal agencies out of the State permit program under 402 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.991" offset="10883284">With all of the confusion which is automatically going to attend upon a Federal permit program to enforce State standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.112" offset="10915780">This is what section 402 (c) says, it said what section 313 says and is what they mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.500" offset="11157361">We think that the requirement applicable by reason of section 313 of the act refers to is a substantive standard imposed in a Federal permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.066" offset="11403643">Well, we say as it means as substantive requirement either in a -- it means a substantive requirement in a Federal permit Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.737" offset="11434258">That is our point that if they are right if it is -- it could mean more of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.011" offset="11455365">It could not mean the substantive requirement in a permit because we say the States have no authority to require permits for Federal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.526" offset="11485458">But we do say it means the same substantive requirement which may be included in a Federal permit that has been issued to a Federal Facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.094" offset="11519731">If I may just refer briefly to one point you made earlier as to whether the permit program under section 402 is a mandatory program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.232" offset="11560273">The environmental protection agency takes the position that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.141" offset="11575947">That they have to have a permit program that is the whole scheme of the statute to control point source pollution by a program of permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.333" offset="11616698">First to be issued by the environmental protection agency and then if a satisfactory State permit program is included by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.585" offset="11657658">Now, the suggestion is made of that because the statute requires and terminates the authority of the administrator to issue Federal permits once he approves a State permit program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.781" offset="11714500">If he approves a State permit program that means one of two things, either that is entire authority to issue permits to Federal facilities as terminated or as it has been suggested in the brief that somehow when he gets rid of his authority to issue permits, that means somehow the States get.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.696" offset="11790151">Well, it seems to us that if we are correct in our position that there is no authority under this statute for the States to compel Federal instrumentalities to obtain permits, that when the administrator approves a State plan which provides for the State issuance of permits necessarily, he cannot approve the plan insofar as it purports to give the States authority to issue permits for Federal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.384" offset="11912822">Because there is nothing in the statute that permits that and we think inherit in the whole concept is when he approves a plan, all that he can approve and all that he loses authority to issue is with respect to those portions of the State plan that are valid and if the State plan is invalid as he held in his regulation and as he held in these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.642" offset="12001952">If it is invalid because under the statute the State cannot require a Federal instrumentality to obtain a permit, then necessarily his approval of the State plan does not touch upon that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.929" offset="12143013">Our answer to that is that the authority to issue permits does not stand from 313, it stems from 402.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.883" offset="12178853">All that 313 does is State that the Federal facilities must comply with the substantive requirements of State and Federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3030.659" offset="12225978">Whether they are imposed under a State program, whether the State has some sort of a regulatory scheme that does not matter as long as the State imposes substantive requirements, 313 requires that the Federal instrumentality is comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.635" offset="12289925">But there is nothing in 313 that speaks of permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.797" offset="12302569">The whole argument is whether the word requirements in 313 covers permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.935" offset="12323049">But 313 does not authorize any issuance of permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.201" offset="12340185">The permits are issued by the Federal system under -- by the administrator under 402 if the administrator delegates to the States, the authority to issue such permits then they have that authority under 402.</text>

            <text syncTime="3183.579" offset="12837661">But it seems to us its – there has been a suggestion here that somehow because you have a permit plan generally, that necessarily indicates that Congress intended to impose that same kind of permits issued by the States upon the Federal authorities and the State authority.</text>
