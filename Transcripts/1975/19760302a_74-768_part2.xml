            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103350">We will resume arguments at this time in Brown against General Services Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.494" offset="145250">Mr. Schnapper, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="12.980" offset="155177">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.540" offset="165417">Yesterday, I delineated several possible rules that the Court might adapt with regard to the question of exhaustion in Section 1981 cases brought by federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.204" offset="212124">We believe that the Court should adapt among these the same rule that was adapted by this Court last term in Johnson against the Railway Express Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.000" offset="255278">As you recall in Johnson, the issue was whether an employee of the REA who wanted to sue under Section 1981 should or indeed could, postpone that Section 1981 action until he had exhausted the administrative remedies created by Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.621" offset="333750">This Court held unanimously that such an employee need not exhaust those remedies and, indeed, under certain circumstances could not postpone this 1981 action while he did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.595" offset="381711">We believe the same rule should be applied to federal employees and we ground that contention on a variety of considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.714" offset="414103">First, as this Court noted in Morton against Mancari, Congress in 1972 concluded that the administrative procedure which is involved here was ineffective for the most part and had served to impede rather than advance the congressional and national policy of eliminating discrimination in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.979" offset="495187">That congressional determination, of course, was based on extensive hearings and a broad factual inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.512" offset="521309">In 1975, the Commission on Civil Rights conducted a similar extensive inquiry and also reached the same conclusion, namely, that the administrative procedures involved had not changed since Congress’ first investigation and that they continue to fail to afford to federal employees a meaningful and fair opportunity for vindication of their claims of employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.244" offset="624232">We believe that these findings should be accepted by the Court and that they undercut completely any basis for exhaustion rule under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.842" offset="662684">We believe that the policy of exhaustion fundamentally rests on there being a reasonable possibility that the pursuit of the procedure involved will in fact yield the relief that the employee wants, and therefore, obviate the need for judicial intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.114" offset="731752">There simply is no realistic possibility that that will occur in the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.069" offset="755575">And in that regard, this case of course presents a somewhat unique situation because normally we do not have these kinds of findings by the Congress or the Civil Rights Commission as to the defects in the procedure and because of those findings, we think that any presumption that the process -- cases simply cannot be indulged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.031" offset="839376">Second, even without regard to those findings, any federal employee who sued prior to proceeding all the way through the administrative process would be entitled to claim that, in fact, it would have been futile for him to do so or to go further than he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.114" offset="903742">And in view of the congressional and commission findings, that he would certainly be able to establish a prima facie case on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.693" offset="930073">And so, we find that the Courts in any one of these cases was involved in a complex and time-consuming factual inquiry as to whether or not further proceedings would have been warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.555" offset="969570">For example, in this case, it might be possible to have a trial as to whether or not going to the Appeals Review Board would be efficacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.436" offset="1001022">We think, for the reasons set out by the Court in Alexander versus Gardner-Denver that it makes more sense for the Court simply o proceed and devote their time directly to a trial on the merits than to what, in many cases, would be a much more cumbersome and time-consuming proceeding as to whether or not the administrative process involved was in fact and under the circumstances likely be efficacious.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="244.372" offset="1080748">The alternative, of course, would be the opposite rule that has been involved in many cases, the presumption is in favor of exhaustion and it is up to the person who claims that exhaustion would be futile, but make it a rather specific showing to that effect?</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="257.654" offset="1133933">Well, with regard to my second contention, we think the employee would be entitled to make that specific showing and the resulting trial would be more cumbersome than a trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.293" offset="1172490">But I think with regard to the presumption, it is true in a sense that a presumption is the only way you are ever going to find that this process is effective because if you look at the process where there are findings of Congress and the Civil Rights Commission, you will have to conclude otherwise.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="285.836" offset="1246677">Well, they are not binding, the conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.083" offset="1259634">The conclusions of Congress are entitled some substantial weight.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="294.075" stopTime="310.223">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="294.075" offset="1279592">Well, I would think the way you would interpret that is to say that if they are entitled the weight that it supports an intent on the part of Congress to not require exhaustion, that you do not use that as an independent lever by which this Court simply concludes on its own that exhaustion is not required?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_schnapper" startTime="310.223" stopTime="357.555">
            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="310.223" offset="1344166">Well, I think what the government invites the Court to do is to fashion a rule with regard to exhaustion that it is based on the assumption that the administrative process is efficacious and what we are suggesting is that Congress and the Civil Rights Commission have found that they are not, and you cannot blink that reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.016" offset="1419399">Any request for an exhaustion rule ultimately puts that in issue and normally it would be resolved in a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.454" offset="1445103">But we think, in view of those findings and of the general policy in this area of independent overlapping remedies, that it would make more sense to just have the simple and straightforward and more administrative rule that exhaustion need not be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.436" offset="1497035">It would be possible to follow the procedure you suggest, but then in this case, for example, we would have to have a trial about the Appeals Review Board and would have to conduct an investigation about that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="357.555" stopTime="376.374">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="357.555" offset="1533502">Is that true in the normal administrative situation where you have a presumption that the administrative remedies are going to be exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.726" offset="1574253">You have a trial in every individual case as to whether, with respect to this particular litigant, he might or might not have gotten some relief?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_schnapper" startTime="376.374" stopTime="459.651">
            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="376.374" offset="1608839">Normally, this Court does in fact inquire whether under the specific circumstances of the case it would have been probably efficacious to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.334" offset="1644679">Now, that may or may not require a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.186" offset="1651993">It may be apparent on the undisputed facts that it would or would have not have been, but in the case of the administrative procedure there are a variety of defects, some which are apparent on the face of the regulation, some of which are more complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.779" offset="1698387">For example, we have noted there are problems of discrimination in the selection of the personnel who administer the procedure, that substantive Title VII law is not in fact followed by these decisions, that the people who administer the procedure are not familiar with Title VII law and have no expertise in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.824" offset="1766619">Now, you could not, in a particular case, require exhaustion in the assumption that all of that was not true and while, perhaps in most cases, those claims which seem sufficiently extraordinary is not to want a plenary judicial inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.866" offset="1822730">In this case, of course, those contentions are the same contentions advanced and sustained by the Congress of United States and Civil Rights Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.884" offset="1850837">I think the least would be entitled to a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.830" offset="1862645">But, the same problem existed in Alexander versus Gardner-Denver with regard to whether there should be deference to the decision of an arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.394" offset="1892842">And, the Court included that while it might be appropriate in some cases and not others, it was administratively simpler just to go ahead and have the case tried, and that is what we think should occur here.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.536" offset="1945401">I want to be positive though for my own notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.393" offset="1960865">I take it you concede that 1972 amendment is retroactive so far as the petitioner is concerned?</text>

            <text syncTime="471.605" offset="1989704">We believe that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.814" offset="2006527">Finally, with regard to exhaustion, we think that the general policy of independent overlapping remedies which was acknowledged and stressed in this Court’s decision in Johnson should be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.751" offset="2066295">In Johnson, of course, the Court noted that the administrative procedure involved had to set up under Title VII, and the Title VII had not required that that procedure be followed by private employees suing under 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.705" offset="2122093">We think that the same rule should be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.054" offset="2135468">It is important to bear in mind that the clear and unequivocal congressional intent behind Title VII was to give federal employees the same judicial remedies that are already enjoyed by private employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.371" offset="2192832">This Court in Boeing against Sharpe (ph), of course, suggested that it would be unthinkable as a matter of substantive law that the rules in the area of discrimination applying to the federal government should be any less stringent than the rules applying to state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.444" offset="2253123">We think the same thing is true with regard to judicial remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.543" offset="2281440">If Mr. Brown had worked for the Railway Express Agency, if he had worked for the State of Illinois, or if he had worked for the City of Richmond, there is no question that he would be able to maintain the suit and we think he should enjoy no less efficacious judicial remedies merely because he worked for the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.897" offset="2378929">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.926" offset="2395020">This case and the next case to be argued, Chandler against Roudebush, will to a large extent, determine the future efficacy of the administrative process which has been established pursuant to statute as a remedy for claims of employment discrimination within the Federal Civil Service and the respective role of the Courts and the administrative process in determining the merits of the thousands of claims that are filed each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.142" offset="2535872">Both cases involve promotion situations in which, in accordance with the normal civil service practice, the applicants were screened for qualifications by those responsible for personnel management and both the complainant and the person selected were rated as highly qualified in each case for the particular vacancy for which the promotion was to occur and then the decision as to which of the highly qualified individual should be promoted was made by the supervisor with the program responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.057" offset="2703474">In Chandler, the complainant differed from the person selected in sex and race, and claimed discrimination on the basis of sex and race.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.044" offset="2747464">In Brown, the complainant differed from the person selected in race and claimed discrimination on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.148" offset="2783931">Now, looking at the Brown complaint, more specifically to see what was at issue, the Brown complaint was carried administratively through the hearing process as well as the informal counseling processes that proceeded and through the agency decision based on the recommendation of the complaints examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.972" offset="2899183">That recommendation is reproduced in the appendix to this case and turning to page 37a in the findings of fact and conclusions the examiner first noted, and this is the basis on which the appointing authority acted, that both Mr. Robert Owen Bee (ph), and at the bottom of page 37a, who was selected and the complaint Mr. Brown were rated as highly qualified for the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.678" offset="3030005">Under the circumstances, the relative experience, education, and background of both Mr. Owen Bee and Mr. Brown are irrelevant to the issues in as much as the rating of highly qualified place these two individuals in the same area of competition for the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.692" offset="3098028">Now, that is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether there was discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.907" offset="3118926">There may have been reliance by the appointing authority on these differences, but the inquiry was into what did the appointing authority rely on and this is spelled out in some detail on the next four pages of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.176" offset="3196039">For one thing, there was testimony, on page 38a just above the middle, from the candidates’ supervisors who unanimously recommended Mr. Owen Bee over Mr. Brown and termed Mr. Brown uncooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.572" offset="3273570">An example is noted of an instance in which Mr. Brown had been requested by one of his supervisors to perform a management survey of the federal telecommunication's record center, but had refused because he thought the request had been made as a favor rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.311" offset="3344519">Well, this is the basis on which the supervisor acted.</text>

            <text syncTime="941.724" offset="3870207">Now, when Mr. Brown went to Court, the recourse that was available to him if he was dissatisfied with the administrative decision based on this record was an appeal to the Civil Service Board, the Appellate Board, which passes on these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.465" offset="3977205">And turning back to Mr. Brown’s complaint, which is on page, I am looking at pages 4a and 5a of the appendix at the very bottom, the complaint itself specifies when he went and made a resort to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.517" offset="4045332">The United States Civil Service Commission has been joined as a party defendant because in entertaining and ruling upon the plaintiff’s complaint of racial discrimination, it acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by failing to make the in-depth inquiry into the alleged racial discrimination as it was to do under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.413" offset="5080930">In any event, the kind of inquiry to be made in a case like this essentially, is a matter well within the Civil Service Commission’s expertise, namely, whether the kinds of considerations brought out in this report of the hearing are the kinds of considerations that are plausibly relied upon in selecting someone for promotion when the individual applicants do not differ from each other on the basis of race, as is often the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.029" offset="5227425">And this is a matter well within competence and experience of the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.944" offset="5251040">Most of the policies of exhaustion of administrative remedies are fully applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.495" offset="5277267">The administrative process is able to give the complete relief asked for in the compliant in the Court and thereby obviate the need for any resort to the Court if the case is meritorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.610" offset="5325750">There is a role to be played by the application of expertise in assessing the factual situation because it is basically a factual case, not as it reaches this Court, but the claim was basically a factual case and there would at least be an opportunity for narrowing the issues for a judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.984" offset="5423239">The considerations that have normally been recited as reasons for requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies are all fully applicable to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.788" offset="5470468">Now, we are told that, nonetheless, this Court held in Johnson against Railway Express Co. that at least as to claims under Section 1981, administrative remedies need not be exhausted and indeed cannot be exhausted in some situations under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.848" offset="5558658">But Johnson, it seems to us, reserved the kind of issue involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.254" offset="5592303">It was written much more narrowly and carefully than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.880" offset="5610798">The issue in Johnson was rather resort to the EEOC conciliation processes was required before a 1981 suit could be filed in a private employment situation in which Congress has not provided a federal administrative remedy which can afford the complete relief sought in a 1981 suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.537" offset="5721453">And the Court carefully noted in Footnote 3 of the Johnson opinion in dealing with an alternative argument, and this is on page 456 and 457 of 421 US, that the complainant there had failed to exhaust his administrative remedy under the Railway Labor Act where Congress had provided a complete administrative remedy that could give him relief, according to the claim, that it did not have to reach that issue because of its holding on the limitations issue which was the controlling issue in Johnson, that the suit was filed out of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.523" offset="5897414">And therefore, we have no occasion here to express a view as to whether or not Section 1981 claim of employment discrimination is ever subject to a requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted in a situation where Congress has provided a full administrative remedy that can give the relief sought in the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.974" offset="5975154">And, again, on page 466, the opinion is carefully tailored to the private employment situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.408" offset="6012979">So, one of our contentions is that the Court of Appeals correctly ruled in this case that the complaint should be dismissed for exhaustion of administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.715" offset="6082152">That was an alternative holding of the Court of Appeals in affirming the dismissal of the compliant by the District Court for want of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.078" offset="6119559">Once the District Court granted the government’s motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction, of course, the question of the exhaustion did not arise in the District Court, but the Court of Appeals was interested in that as an alternative ground for affirming the dismissal of the --</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.015" offset="7207402">Well, these are public records and the point to be made is that the complaints process and the examination of the complaints process is not the only method that Congress specified or indeed the Congress is looking into in its continuing supervision of this area in alleviating problems in the Federal Civil Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.551" offset="7329551">And the statistical report gave some examples of the inquiries in minority group representation at various grade levels during the period from 1971-1974, at a time when overall federal employment was decreasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.188" offset="7420039">In the notation with respect to grade GS9 which is what the application was for in this case and that is on page 4 and, of course, giving these statistics indicated that there has been an increase of some 2,800 minority personnel in that particular grade level and there are comparable figures more than 2,000 increase with respect to grade GS12, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.809" offset="7534560">Now, to a small extent, those increases may reflect the resolution of the complaints procedures, the kind that are involved in this case, but for the most part, they represent the implementation of the Affirmative Action Programs that the Commission has undertaken and the review that it conducts through its Bureau of Personnel Management Evaluation of the equal opportunity employment plans that the agencies are required to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.366" offset="7684712">And one of the advantages of the administrative process that was established in the 1972 Act is that in the course of ruling and investigating the individual complaint, the complaints examiner is also trained to evaluate the overall program of the agency in this area and to make recommendations, to make that overall program more effective regardless of what he finds with respect to the claim of the particular individual whether that individual has a claim of discrimination against himself has merit or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.275" offset="7864434">The regulations that we have reproduced in the appendix to our brief, the regulation on the hearing specifies on page 38a that the examiner is to look into not only the matter which gave rise to the complaint but also the general environment out of which the complaint arose and he is to make his recommended decision to the agency on the merits of the complaint, including the recommended remedial action where appropriate, and also his recommendations with regard to the general environment out of which the complaint arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.655" offset="8049903">In a case such as the present one, these promotion cases, this is not particularly a typical and many of them, of course, do not even reach the Courts, these promotion cases are the most frequent of the equal employment opportunity complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.956" offset="8111134">In a case such as this one, it seems likely to us that that aspect of the compliant examiner’s function is more likely to be fruitful than a ruling on the merits where it is very difficult for any tribunal, administrative or judicial to second guess the determination of the person responsible for the program as to which -- the person is rated as highly qualified, he wants to rely on to carry on the program, so long as he has reasons that are independent of racial consideration in such matters.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="2690.036" offset="10863396">I would like to respond to a number of things raised by the government in this case, and I turn first to the question of whether Title VII repeal these other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.939" offset="10907072">The government suggests that the usual rule against repeals by implication applies only when the substantive rules involved are different and not when they are supplementary or complimentary remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.255" offset="10956287">That is just not the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.614" offset="10961721">At least since Wood versus the United States in 1848, the law has been exactly to the contrary and we set out in our reply brief a number of cases involving supplementary remedies applying this rule against a repeal by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.501" offset="11021280">The government distinguishes Jones against Mayer by noting that at the time of Jones, Congress had reason to believe that there might be another remedy available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.548" offset="11057538">But when Title VII was adapted in 1964, as we have noted in our reply brief, there were numerous statements in the floor of the House and the Senate to the effect that Congress thought there were no other remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.080" offset="11103618">The legislative history in which Congress indicated they thought there were additional judicial remedies is from 1972, but of course, the statute involved was adapted in 1964 and not in 1972.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.178" offset="11148026">Would there be expressed saving language in the 1964 Act?</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="2764.777" offset="11162446">I do not believe there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.393" offset="11168819">Moreover, in Sullivan versus Little Hunting Park, the government maintained, and we think correctly, that it really does not matter whether the government thought there was an independent remedy available or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.852" offset="11214690">With regard to Gnotta, we, I must confess do think it was not correctly decided, but as indeed, I think, certainly, the Civil Service Commission was of that opinion when it advised Congress on this matter several years ago and I do understand the Solicitor General in opposing certain audit to have also taken that position.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.673" offset="11306014">Gnotta versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.499" offset="11313329">It is the decision by Justice Blackmun when he was on another Court, but be that as it may, not expressly stressed that in that case which was a suit based on discrimination on the grounds of natural origin, there was no provision applicable to that plaintiff comparable to Section 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.298" offset="11392532">Well, there is such a statute here and it is 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.273" offset="11408414">With regard to the problem of exhaustion, I think I should state in clear terms what the difference is between the government’s perception of this administrative procedure and ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.476" offset="11453241">We believe that it is an extremely complex procedure, controlled as in Glover by the defendants out of which, at the end, there was no relief granted in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.332" offset="11500574">The government has indicated in these papers and we have noted similar statistics that out of approximately 26,000 complaints of employment discrimination against the federal government that were initiated with EEO counselors, backpay was awarded to approximately 50 people in the entire year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.122" offset="11579778">That compares quiet dramatically with the statistics for the EEOC conciliation procedure which over the same period of time, had twice as many complaints, but got backpay for 49,388 people and suggests, as the government does, that exhaustion should be required here because the federal procedure is better than the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.207" offset="11656160">We suggest that it is, at the least, not supported by the results of the system.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="2892.592" offset="11673714">Those statistics simply might indicate that the government, as an employer, is more aware of the requirements of non-discrimination in employment than many employers in the private sector?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_schnapper" startTime="2903.810" stopTime="2946.139">
            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="2903.810" offset="11718540">Well, that is possible but, of course, Congress thought just the contrary when it adapted Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.511" offset="11741319">The legislative hearings and committee reports are replete with conclusions that in fact the problems of employment discrimination in the federal government were very serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.031" offset="11787399">The government suggested that all the relief that is sought in this case could have been gotten in the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.117" offset="11807774">Now, without laying aside for a moment our contention that even what is technically available in the administrative process is never in fact given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.009" offset="11839330">There are variety of things that simply are not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.622" offset="11849779">There is a 30-day statute of limitations for awards of backpay in the administrative process and that, of course, is not the statute of limitations in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.244" offset="11884261">The government has what is known --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2946.139" offset="11887814">What do you mean by 30-day statute of limitations, do you mean at the time of award of maximum backpay, there can be award as 30 days?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_schnapper" startTime="2955.664" stopTime="3016.875">
            <label>Mr. Eric Schnapper</label>
            <text syncTime="2955.664" offset="11925952">No, the way this system works is that you have to -- if the kind of discrimination which you are complaining exists over a period of time, the government will only run back to 30days before the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.774" offset="11990423">This particular plaintiff complains that that he has been discriminated against a promotion as a result of an ongoing practice that goes back for several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.782" offset="12018426">He simply could not get relief from most of that on the administrative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.306" offset="12028561">It is not allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.695" offset="12034099">Second, the government has what is known in the practice as a “but for” rule which provides that once discrimination is shown, the burden of proof is on the employee to show that the practice of discrimination was in fact the cause of his non-promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.394" offset="12104839">Now, the rule in Title VII law and the Courts is exactly the opposite and the difference is of some substantial importance because in the vast majority of cases in which the federal government finds there has been discrimination it does not award backpay to anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="3016.875" offset="12170772">In this case, of course, your client did make an administrative complaint to his agency and a hearing before a certified complaints examiner and is it your position that not even that much exhaustion of administrative remedies is required?</text>

            <text syncTime="3044.332" offset="12280591">But we think, on the facts of this case, further exhaustion just makes no sense.</text>
