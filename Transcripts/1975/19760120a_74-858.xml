            <text syncTime="59.798" offset="342529">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.337" offset="360606">This case raises the question whether a State can devise pre-judgment seizure remedies to protect its citizens against fraud which will comport with Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.576" offset="425599">It comes to this Court on direct appeal from a three Court judgment by a three Court judge panel that was convened in the Southern District of New York whose judgment held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.512" offset="497383">All of the provisions of the New York attachment statute, the grounds of which are based upon fraudulent activity by a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.031" offset="535417">The provisions have found at Sub-sections 4, 5 and 8 of Section 6201 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.221" offset="576168">Sub-division 4 provides that a judge in his discretion upon a prima-facie showing by evidentiary facts that a defendant with intent to defraud his creditors has assigned, disposed up, or secreted his assets or that he is about to do the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.234" offset="660283">Sub-division 5 permits a judge in his discretion to issue such an order upon a prima-facie demonstration that the plaintiff has a cause of action in contract, and secondly that the defendant has committed a fraud at the inception of that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.326" offset="736560">Sub-division 8 permits the judge in his discretion to issue such an order upon a demonstration, prima-facie by the plaintiff that he has a cause of action for either fraud or deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.847" offset="798732">I think it would be helpful as a model, if I briefly stated the facts which underlay the attachment in this action and which led to the commencements of the action in the Lower Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.326" offset="840632">The appellant, Curtis Circulation Company, a national distributor of magazines enfident to a written agreement with Bert Randolph Sugar, a publisher of sports magazines, and a corporation which he then called Champion Sports.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.152" offset="903953">Under the terms of the agreement Curtis agreed to make advances to the Champion based upon estimates f sales of the magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.436" offset="937076">And the agreement provided that in the event that the payments they made were excessive because the estimates turned out to be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.449" offset="965079">They would have a right to recoup those over payments from subsequent additions of the magazines that were covered by this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.189" offset="996008">At the time the contract was entered into, Sugar represented to Curtis that he control the Champion, and Champion was the owner of the magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.421" offset="1032998">After it had been in effect for some 18 months and at a time when substantial monies were due to Curtis by Champion and the contract still had three-and-a-half years to run, Curtis discovered that Sugar has stripped Champion of all of its assets and had arranged to sell all of its magazines to two purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.742" offset="1118261">It learned that the seller under the two purchase agreements was not Champion, with respect to whom Sugar represented, it was the owner of the magazine, but another corporation called Wrestling Revue, over which Sugar also had control.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.556" offset="1185553">And it also learned that all the consideration payable under these two agreements of sale were payable by the purchasers to Wrestling and not the Champion.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.103" offset="1219721">It learned that Sugar had represented to the purchasers that Wrestling was always the owner of the magazines that Champion, although the ostensible owner was just publishing these magazines under an alleged license agreement with the Wrestling that it had failed pay to its license fees, hence Wrestling revoked the license and now is in the position to come to these purchasers and sell all of these magazines, free of any obligation under the Curtis Distribution Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.872" offset="1330794">Based upon those facts, Curtis determined that it must have defraud that the inception of the contract when Sugar said that Champion was the owner of the magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.757" offset="1370291">Or that Sugar had defrauded it after the contract and stripped Champion of its assets like by concocting this alleged license agreement and the purported ownership by Wrestling.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.197" offset="1416057">Accordingly, that the term that had to act promptly to arrest the further flow of those assets in the hands or places where it would not be able to satisfy its right to recoup or its right to damages for fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.464" offset="1465168">The contract still having a three-and -half years to run and they having lost their opportunity to distribute those magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.281" offset="1492439">Curtis supplied ex parte pursuant to Section 6211 of the New York statute for an order of attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.336" offset="1524622">In support of that application as the statute requires, it submitted this one affidavit of its secretary which contained evidentiary facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.597" offset="1573732">The facts largely but in greater detail than those that I just described your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.313" offset="1596511">And next to the affidavit was to verify complaint in the action, a copy of the distribution agreement and a detailed statement of the account between Curtis and Champion, showing the monies then do an owing to Curtis.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.232" offset="1808208">First time anything gets filed in the Court is when you ask the Court for some sort of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.578" offset="1825657">The statute talks about commencing an action at the time you ask for a provisional remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.902" offset="1854914">Although I do want make it plain, you do not have to serve the compliant to other papers in advanced, it is an ex parte application.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.768" offset="1878320">The statute does require you to serve the complaint on 24 hours notice, when it is demanded and beyond 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.148" offset="1911861">That length of period being designed primarily for interim jurisdiction where the defendant might be out of state and might take quite a while to serve and possibly require an order of publication and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.482" offset="2157203">You mean a finding by a Court or what Curtis learned?</text>
            <text syncTime="516.400" offset="2168906">No, there was no evidentiary hearing below and there has been no such finding by a Court, certainly not in a Federal Court and its now on the ready calendar of the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.124" offset="2211747">We just do not have a record on that right now, Mr. Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.019" offset="2247378">With respect to the grounds upon which the Lower Court relied for its decision, it really relied entirely upon three distinctions which it perceived this case had from this Courts decision in Mitchell against W. T. Grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.480" offset="2321252">It held first, if I can paraphrase it, that although it recognize the defendants and the State of New York had a right to immediately move to vacate the attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.275" offset="2364407">One of the matters discussed at length in Mitchell, this Court found that under New York Law, the burden of proof upon the preliminary hearing was on the defendant and they held that did not comport with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.709" offset="2418114">Secondly, reading Mitchell most narrowly, the Court seem to require as a Sine qua none of any prejudgment seizure that the plaintiff have a prior vendors lien or statutory lien in the property which he sought to attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.726" offset="2490212">Finally, related to the second ground but somewhat different was the Court's finding that allegations of fraud, are not immutable to pass a proof on a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.054" offset="2535561">As I read the Court's decision, that being the case, there really, if one follows that to his logical conclusion, you just cannot get a prejudgment seizure based on fraud that will comport with Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.764" offset="2602330">Because the Lower Courts certainly wrote in view of the decision in Mitchell which incidentally was decided after the complaint was originally filed but before the three judges convened to hear and determine the action, Mitchell, as I read it, certainly does not place the emphasis on whether the writ is issued in the first instance, ex parte or whether its done have to notice, the emphasis there is the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.715" offset="2710163">I think the Lower Court correctly followed that concept but in holding from its reading of Mitchell that fraud could not be easily proved at a preliminary hearing, therefore fraud could never be the basis for an attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.777" offset="2786441">I think is extraordinary preposition on space.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.933" offset="2803055">The Courts seemed to go equally as flaw with respect to the vendors lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.041" offset="2823430">I do not think that this Court intended in Mitchell that absent to vendors lien or statutory lien, a plaintiff could not under any circumstances gets a prejudgment seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1523.866" offset="6198764">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.261" offset="6216319">The importance of the question on this appeal is rather obvious certainly to the State of New York because it brings into issue, the types of situations where the provisional remedy of attachment is proper and constitutional basically of course the remedy of attachment is an ex parte order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.406" offset="6308896">And this type of order, this ex parte type of order has been a matter of frequent concern to this Court in the past several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.780" offset="6342438">In fact, this is the fourth time, I think within the last three or four years that this type of issue has come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.128" offset="6387786">And I think we have to ask ourselves in what circumstances preliminary relief can be granted ex parte in a manner in the Court with a Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.712" offset="6442121">And of course while the broad outlines are available in this area and most recently in Mitchell against W. T. Grant and North Georgia against Di-Chem, many of the specifics are still in doubt in the subject of much discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.650" offset="6501889">I think the Lower Court decision and order in this instant case is a demonstration of the confusion that exists in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.187" offset="6540028">Now, I think we should consider the basic rule or basic procedure that sequestrations or as in Louisiana or in the Mitchell and attachments issue ex parte and it is also clear that the fact of issues ex parte is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.307" offset="6628531">And that the mere postponement of judicial inquiry is not a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.086" offset="6651623">However, I also recognize that there are safeguards necessary when ex parte order is issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.987" offset="6679208">And in this regard Mitchell, the Mitchell case is an example of some of those safeguards or what types of safeguards are sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.257" offset="6720377">But Due Process of course is not inflexible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.830" offset="6730617">On the other hand, I would say on the other end of the spectrum, the decision of Di-Chem is an example of what is absolutely unacceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.811" offset="6766562">Now, as to the purpose of attachment, I think there is no dispute that New York has a sufficient purpose for granting attachments in this area which are basically fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.087" offset="6815672">But that is a security aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.999" offset="6823300">Of course there is another aspect jurisdiction which is not involved in the decision here but as I say we are dealing with the security type of attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.472" offset="6869171">This is where the State seeks to protect the ultimate collectability of a judgment rather than to assert jurisdiction in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.358" offset="6900727">And of course, in New York these type of security attachments are only allowed in certain specified instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.171" offset="6927999">They are not available in every law suit, you can not just because you have a lawsuit, get an attachment or seek one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.846" offset="6950673">And, I would further state that it is a point for the legislature to determine that you need the remedy of attachment in this fraud situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.529" offset="7029458">Fraud of course is pernicious vice and it always has been a concern, I think to any, to Courts and the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.053" offset="7063522">Now, in the Court judgment opinion below, they seem to make a finding that because the attaching party in the instant case, did not have a vendor’s lien that it only had a claim of fraud that it also had some evidence that assets were being secreted or taken out of the State, that attachment should not be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.507" offset="7173341">I submit that, in view of the legitimate purpose of the attachment in the instant case, that finding of determination is an error because it basically prevents a State from ever protecting its citizens against this type of fraud situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.125" offset="7247842">I would also submit that it is an unduly narrow reading of the holding of Mitchell against W. T. Grant or the tenure of that decision and I would also submit that this view that it is narrow reading of Mitchell was confirmed by this Courts opinion in the Di-Chem case where the Georgia attachment of garnishment statute was struck down and the matter of vendor’s lien was not even mentioned, never mentioned once.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.143" offset="7367901">I think it still remains the rule, as it was many years stated that it is for the legislature to determine what circumstances in an attachment shall be granted and of course, it is for the Court to decide whether the facts of any particular case warrant the remedy of attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.187" offset="7436028">Now, as I have noted the prevention of fraud is an important State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.972" offset="7463195">This was even recognized in the case of Fuentes against Shevin as one of its exceptions to the prior assertion of State power ex parte and I submit that this assertion by the State of its interest in prevention of fraud or secretion of assets or rendering uncollectible judgment should be upheld by this Court in the instant case because as in Mitchell it avoids self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.286" offset="7564446">If you do not have this remedy available you will have instances of self-help and since by the way, this is a commercial case, it does facilitate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.011" offset="7603316">Now, I wish to emphasize that while we do have the question of fraud, there is a great deal of importance to be placed upon the fact that in New York a judge issues the writ of attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.140" offset="7663816">There is judicial supervision at every step of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.975" offset="7683251">Now, I think it is important to note and this Court has placed emphasis on the judicial function, it is not just that a judge is a more powerful official than a clerk or a neutral official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.747" offset="7726301">It is rather and I emphasize this that he can exercise discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.927" offset="7746990">He can determine whether there is a cause of action, whether there are evidentiary facts to support the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.724" offset="7774157">In New York indeed, even if the papers formally support the granting of the writ of attachment, a judge in his discretion can still refuse to grant that writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.505" offset="7825357">It is not just simply plugging in the numbers of New York and getting your writ of attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.276" offset="7844374">That is quite different from many other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.449" offset="7853047">I submit it is quite different even from Louisiana statute or the facts of the Louisiana Mitchell case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.373" offset="7988779">He just did not go once and get the writ of attachment, he had to produce more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.169" offset="8011976">The judge would not sign this order of attachment without even more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.750" offset="8034336">There are no standard forms in New York, we have forms of publishers I dare say, there are no standard forms in New York for checking the boxes and getting a writ of attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.458" offset="8069132">I have seen such examples of such forms in other States for getting writs of attachment.</text>

            <text syncTime="5059.962" offset="20343130">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.201" offset="20356087">I would make the brief observation that certainly my adversary would have been making a fine presentation to the litigated motion part of New York State Supreme Court, New York County when he was arguing about whether there was fraud in this case or whether there was not fraud in this case or whether the allegations was sufficient and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.692" offset="20470085">I think though that we should recognize that this is the United States Supreme Court and it should be emphasized that basically this was a decision below based upon the unconstitutionality of the State statute and we should always keep that in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.378" offset="20576769">Now I have been informed by the way, when there was a question of adversary hearings, a case, I think it was a famous case a few years ago called Lily Pons’ involving the singer Lily Pons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.149" offset="20623894">And it was an adversary hearing on residency, it was a jurisdictional attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.980" offset="20647195">For example, once again, I think your Honors have all recognized that residency is a factual issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.861" offset="20674781">But what seems to be mistaken here is that when we are dealing with questions of fraud, there is a basically a compelling State interest to put the funds into an effect escrow and mind you in New York under this attachment the funds do not go to the plaintiff, they are kept by the sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.977" offset="20759208">To keep these funds available.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.095" offset="20771643">This is I believe different, generally in sequestration situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.769" offset="20786376">And there is in this compelling necessity to have a fraud attachment, the concomitant that at the very institution of the suit, you cannot expect the plaintiff to prove his case of fraud in to-to, there is no question to convince the judge to sign that order ex parte or to convince him to deny the motion to vacate the attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.860" offset="20910719">You are going to have some evidentiary facts, something more than a mere scintilla, something more than suspicion or surmise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.161" offset="20935901">It definitely, I think is clear from the New York cases that you do get a genuine hearing, it may be legal, it may be factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="5215.312" offset="20964531">And at this hearing and I would say it is a real hearing—</text>
