            <text syncTime="80.492" offset="396581">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.300" offset="407761">This is a federal income tax case which comes here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.224" offset="439526">It involves Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which permits carrybacks and carryovers of net operating loss deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.491" offset="492607">The question presented is whether respondent, a corporation can carryback a $42,000 loss it incurred in 1968 as an offset against its 1966 taxable income of $174,000 and thereby reduce its taxable income to $132,000 and after that offset, take $35,000 of that $42,000 loss and use it as an offset against its 1967 taxable income?</text>
            <text syncTime="140.418" offset="636281">We submit that from a mathematical and statutory standpoint the answer to this question is plainly no.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.482" offset="664493">$42,000 can only be used once to offset the $174,000 of taxable income and no part remains for further use as an offset for 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.221" offset="711513">The facts are fairly straightforward and were stipulated to the District Court and can be summarized as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="167.565" offset="744846">In 1966, respondent had taxable income of $174,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.773" offset="769714">In 1968, it had a loss, ended operating loss of $42,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.074" offset="794896">Now, pursuant to Section 172, respondent carried back its $42,000 loss to the third year that is 1966, and then proceeded to compute its 1966 tax liability as if that $42,000 loss was incurred in that earlier year.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.016" offset="890609">Now, the Code for corporations prescribes two methods of taxation: One the so-called regular method under Section 11 of the Code, provides for regular corporate income tax rates, and in this case that regular method yielded a tax liability of $58,000, those are the corporate rates on a $132,000 of taxable income, which was $174,000 minus $42,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.779" offset="1013698">Now, under Section 1201(a) of the Code, respondent was required to compute its tax under the alternative tax computation, which corporations can avail themselves off when they have capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.145" offset="1083184">It engaged in the prescribed computation, which we have set forth in our brief at page 4 under the alternative method.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.576" offset="1120904">Basically it is a two-step approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.973" offset="1134488">It took its $173,000 or what we say was $174,000 essentially, subtracted the $42,000 loss, got taxable income of $132,000 and then what it had to do was to subtract out its capital gains, and basically the step-one operation to tax yielded zero or a negative number.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.655" offset="1253188">It then had to compute the capital gain segment, the step-two part of the partial tax, the capital gains tax, which is a flat 25% of the $166,000 of what the statute refers to as long-term capital gain over short-term capital loss, but for these purposes, we simply call capital gains, and it got a tax liability of $41,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.524" offset="1348692">Now under the Code, respondent was required to report its tax liability under the net effect yielded to the lower liability, so it did and it paid taxes of $41,000 for 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.872" offset="1418073">Now, this suit involves the year 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.036" offset="1434792">Respondent filed a refund claim and asserted that even though its $42,000 loss had been used to offset its taxable income in its entirety, that somehow it still has $35,000 of this loss available to offset income in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.990" offset="1514517">Respondent’s claim essentially is that a segmented approach is the proper approach and that is that the $42,000 1968 loss should only be offset against its $7,000 of ordinary income and that yielded $35,000 for use in the subsequent year.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.622" offset="1609081">The District Court in Missouri upheld respondent’s claim and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.707" offset="1641472">In so holding, I think it is significant that the Eighth Circuit acknowledged that its holding was contrary to the Treasury Regulations which have, which were promulgated shortly after the 1954 codification and have existed more or less in the same state ever since.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.196" offset="1767383">Perhaps that is a little more persuasive than Treasury Regulations.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="428.789" offset="1789744">Well, we think that Treasury Regulations are correct and we think the Tax Court in this case is incorrect as I will attempt to demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.632" offset="1821090">At the time of the Eight Circuit’s decision, the First Circuit and the Ninth Circuit had indeed rejected the government’s position, but all be it in brief Per curiam affirmances.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.135" offset="1871141">In fact, the First Circuit characterized this question as unimportant and seldom occurring even though I think that subsequent developments have indicated that the issue is important and frequently occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.777" offset="1933730">In our petition for Certiorari, we told the Court that there are about $34 million of taxes riding on this issue and that it frequently occurs because of the operation of the alternative tax and the net operating loss carryback.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.050" offset="2002798">I think it is fair to characterize the Court of Appeals’ decision as influenced largely by the cumulative weight of two appellate decisions rejecting the Government’s position.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.300" offset="2051804">But thereafter, and in fact, within three or four months after the decision in this case, the Fourth Circuit rendered its decision in Mutual Assurance Society versus Commissioner, which we submit to the Court as a well reasoned and proper analysis of the statutory problem here and thereafter the Sixth Circuit in Axelrod versus Commissioner upheld the Commissioner’s position in a case involving an individual taxpayer, but its opinion largely criticizes the Tax Court’s decision in Chartier Real Estate Co. and speaks approvingly of the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Mutual Assurance Co.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.672" offset="2233303">Now, the resolution of this problem depends upon a careful analysis of the applicable statutory provision which in this case is Section 172(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.839" offset="2289936">Now, we have set out the pertinent part of this provision at top of page 18 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.024" offset="2322641">The statute reads the portion of such loss which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years shall be the access if any of the amount of such loss over the sum of the taxable income for each of the prior taxable years to which such loss may be carried.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="581.328" offset="2399859">Is it not the key phrase in your submission at least, taxable income, and technical meaning of that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="587.235" stopTime="749.166">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="587.235" offset="2423579">Indeed, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.094" offset="2434968">We submit that taxable income is a statutory term of art and that it is defined in Section 63 of the Code which we have set forth at page 36 in our Appendix through our brief on the merits which again says that taxable income is gross income minus the deductions allowed by this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.039" offset="2522739">Now in 1966, the respondent’s taxable income was $174,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.653" offset="2565162">Carrying back that loss and determining the excess if any of the amount of such loss over the sum of the taxable income for 1966, demonstrates in our view that that loss is completely absorbed and that there is no longer any part of it available for use in a subsequent taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.692" offset="2665368">Now, respondent basically does not dispute the definition of taxable income which is set forth very plainly in the Code, but it submits that because it used the alternative tax computation in the early year, that somehow that requires a different result in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.257" offset="2755647">Now, we submit that the statutory language is plain and that disoperation of subtracting $42,000 from $174,000 in yielding a $132,000 of taxable income is dictated by the statute and that there is no basis for inferring any further modifications from the statutory term, 'taxable income'.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.173" offset="2863272">Indeed, if the Court would examine Section 172(d) of the Code, you will find that there are basically a group of modifications that Congress has prescribed from the term 'taxable income', but the modification that respondent seeks to engraft on the Code is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.476" offset="2944460">These are detailed statutes and we think in the first instance that the language has to be employed pretty much in a mechanical sort of way because these are detailed and mechanical statutes designed to provide limited kinds of relief for averaging, so to speak and alleviating some of the harsh results that might be caused by annual accounting method which is sort of bedrock of our tax system.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="749.166" offset="3071311">Mr. Smith, I understand your position.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.112" offset="3087089">You think the language is perfectly clear, but it is true, is it not that the Tax Court takes a different view as to the meaning of the language, particularly the meaning of taxable income in the context in which it is used.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="767.829" offset="3145917">So it cannot be all that clear, can it, if the agency…</text>

          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="771.719" stopTime="891.179">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="771.719" offset="3161486">Well, as we have argued in our brief, we think and as the Fourth Circuit has set forth at great length in its opinion, we think that the Tax Court’s reading of the statute is somewhat forced and unnatural because it would require the insertion -- if you bear with me, I am looking again at page 24 of our brief which sets forth the statute again -- we say here that the Tax Court’s construction views the statute as if it read the sum of the taxable income to which such loss may be carried for each of the prior years to which such loss may be carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.596" offset="3332953">Indeed that, the phrase to which such loss may be carried would have to be repeated twice in order to shore up the Tax Court’s construction or as we would submit modification of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.933" offset="3386348">But as the Fourth Circuit pointed out, even if you were to say that loss had to be carried back against taxable income, it still requires some substantial, we think re-writing of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.311" offset="3435876">You would have to say, loss carried back against taxable income which in this case is still the same $174,000, but you would have to further say, but only to the extent that there was no reduction in tax liability and we think the fact that there was a reduction in tax liability here for 1966, this as a function of Congress’ attempt to impose a lesser burden on long-term capital gains and we think this is basically a statutory trade off.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.284" offset="3559696">Essentially, you either get the alternative tax benefits or you get the operating loss carried back.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.457" offset="3600447">We think that it is improper for the Tax Court to have concluded that these benefits be pyramided, in effect cumulated, if you will.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="891.179" offset="3639317">But in this case the benefits are highly-pyramided, are they not?</text>
            <text syncTime="894.817" offset="3653841">Do you not end up on your formulation, finish taxing of this tax payer on $35,000 it never ends if you aggregate these three years?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="911.026" offset="3718730">Well, I think that there may be confusion over tax base and taxable income to be sure there is a tax computation on a $166,000, but it is at a markedly lesser rate than the corporate rate, it is flat 25%, this is an enormous benefit and this produces a tax liability of $41,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.036" offset="3814756">Now, otherwise the corporation would have had to pay $58,000 tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.960" offset="3834400">Now, in this particular case although I think it is coincidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.885" offset="3846103">I think it is somewhat graphic that the very “lost” benefit that the taxpayer complains of that is the loss of a $35,000 loss, which in effect is worth $17,500 is made up pretty much equally by the difference between $58,000 and $41,000 which is also $17,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.149" offset="3943174">So the Congress basically said you either do it one way or the other and this is basically a statutory trade off.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.503" offset="3968565">We do not think that.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.762" offset="3973685">We agree that there is the loss of the benefit of this $35,000 loss.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="981.489" offset="4000539">But is it not true that that $17,000 is just a pure coincidence?</text>

          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="985.167" stopTime="1255.630">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="985.167" offset="4015272">I think it is, but I think it is a helpful gauge in this case because essentially corporations generally pay a tax on 50% of their taxable income and in this particular case they are paying a tax on $25,000 of a larger base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.621" offset="4085071">But we think that essentially you cannot sort of cumulate these benefits and we think that the statutory language, the use of the term taxable income, signals Congress’ clear intent to provide this kind of straight mathematical equation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.262" offset="4151631">I think if there is evidence in the legislative history, here I think I commend to the Court the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit’s exploration of the history of the statute, which indicated that this result, the result that the taxpayer seeks in this case, would not have been available under Section 122(d) of the 1939 Code, which did not use the phrase through which the taxable that last phrase, to the prior taxpayers to which such loss may be carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.876" offset="4294050">It simply talked about over net income of the intervening year and I think that the fact that Congress reenacted the statute without any attempt to buttress without -- it is the committee reports are totally silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.438" offset="4372313">It said essentially prior law is reaffirmed and prior law under the old statute clearly would have rejected the taxpayer’s petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.666" offset="4413273">I also think that it is not without coincidence that shortly after the 1954 Code was codified and before the Tax Court decided, it rendered its Chartier decision that the commentary was uniformly to the effect that there could be situations where a loss would be “loss” so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.226" offset="4507523">That essentially you are either going to get the alternative tax computation or you are going to get the net operating loss carried back and then after Chartier came down, I must confess that I have looked into this question and asked the people of Internal Revenue Service, they received a lot of calls from private tax people also expressing surprise about the Chartier decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.409" offset="4604281">I know that the history of this litigation is somewhat dogged from the Commissioner’s point of view, we have sought to establish a conflict of decisions and we have succeeded, but it basically because we think that this sort of -- there are approach corresponds to legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.830" offset="4669900">The post Chartier commentary is pretty much uniformly in our favor as well and since the following of our briefs a new article has come out more or less to so to speak the balance, a critical, the only critical article we have been able to find in the Tax Lawyer, which is the publication of the ABA section on taxation, but an article in 29 Tax Lawyer in 4, 1975 issue, entitled “Net Operating Losses and Capital Gains, a Deceptive Combination” and that again supports the Commissioner’s view that you cannot cumulate and then support the view of the Fourth Circuit, that you cannot cumulate the benefits of these privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.829" offset="4849936">I think it is also useful if I may to sort of try to go, try to explore for a moment the underpinnings of this whole net operating loss deduction and to demonstrate as I think can be done that the Fourth Circuit’s approach here is eminently a sound one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.742" offset="4937603">For example, what the net operating loss carryback deduction is attempting to do is to in effect say, okay, this $42,000 loss occurred in 1968, but we are going to pretend as if it occurred in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.591" offset="5016911">Let us assume that it occurred in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.881" offset="5026106">I think in this case, it is absolutely plain that what would happened would be that the same $41,000 of tax would be paid by the taxpayer and that there would be no net operating loss carryover, there would be no net operating loss for that year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.806" offset="6309868">But as we point out in our Reply Brief, this is not the net operating loss carryback and carryforward provisions are not fluid system to enable the taxpayer to sort of use a loss, to hunt around for a place where it will do some benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.516" offset="6372666">In fact, the three years back and five years forward is essentially a statutory system designed to say well at some point we are going to cut if off these benefits and reassert the strictures, however harsh they maybe of the annual accounting system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.507" offset="6444659">We think that to the extent that there is policy here, it has to be a squared with the detailed rules that Congress prescribe and I refer the Court to its three decisions in Woolford Realty Co., Lewyt and Olympic Radio and Rio Motors where the Court more or less said that these things are detailed rules and they have to be prescribed with their detailed verbiage and indeed in Rio Motors their loss carryover was denied basically because of timing and while that may sadden the particular taxpayer -- we think that, that is really a question for Congress to address itself and not for the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.232" offset="7431566">Mr. Justice Stevens, that situation is what I often call the same year’s situation and it is the situation where a deficit in ordinary income occurs in the same year that one has a large capital gain and the Weil case which has been much mooted in arguments before this Court says, as it said in 1954 and so far as I know it is been uniformed with 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.128" offset="7555072">It says that, "If it occurs in the same year, the one does not offset the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.526" offset="7580672">The full capital gain must be taxed under the alternative method and there is no reduction offered by reason of the deficit in ordinary income."</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.604" offset="7621006">Now, the Tax Court has looked at this and it is found that the directions in the alternative tax statute on this very point are unqualified and has no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.397" offset="7668235">This is what the unqualified directions of the statute say and therefore, there is no reduction in tax there, and I see a further question perhaps on your face or in your mind and that is, in such case is there a net operating loss to be carried over to another year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.510" offset="7744617">The answer is there is not because subsection (c) and (d) of the statute tell just exactly how that is to be computed, so that in the same year situation, one must agree, that the loss disappears, it does a vanishing act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.759" offset="7961642">They have put a certain threshold on taxpayers which taxpayers must need in order to have in net operating loss, but once they pass that threshold, then Congress has always provided other casts in the carry years to see how much or what would be absorbed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2017.629" offset="8145126">The Tax Court found that to which such loss maybe carried, results in a favorable result to the taxpayer here because it said, it modifies taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.508" offset="8184624">The taxable income to which it maybe carried and in that case, since in our case, the loss had not been carried against our capital gain at $35,000 not so carried was available for a carryover to another year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.020" offset="8258707">So, of course it is the interpretation of that sentence of the statute, but may it please the Court, we would suggest that it is perhaps a little more than an exercise in a merely reading a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.771" offset="8325685">It perhaps requires the Court to examine the consequences of these interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.806" offset="8349822">If it finds the statute at all ambiguous to determine -- and the consequences may tell the Court some significant things about the possible intent of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2109.780" offset="8513766">Consequently the tax Court was the first court that got to speak on the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.867" offset="8538112">There, as in our case, the taxpayer had a loss which he would carry to a year that had ordinary income and capital gain in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.915" offset="8570295">The loss wiped up the ordinary income but then there was some still left and in his first petition, the taxpayer said, “May I take this against the capital gain in computing the alternative tax?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.581" offset="8624944">The Tax Court said, “No”, and as I was indicating in my answer to Mr. Justice Stevens, there is an unqualified direction in the statute to that affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.126" offset="8671128">The taxpayer then said “May I then carryover my loss to the next year and use it to reduce the ordinary income of that year to the extent, that there is some?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.350" offset="8727970">The Government objected but over that objection, the Tax Court allowed this saying that the statute, the law statute, permitted this treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.421" offset="8768304">Now, the Chartier Court is the only court which has had two petitions before it at the same time which it was confronted with both of these questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2217.071" offset="8942906">We should like the Court to take note of certain irrationalities which we think are introduced by the Government’s position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.561" offset="8980836">The government has to admit notwithstanding its argument against cumulating benefits, the government has to admit that in many cases, a taxpayer may use his net operating loss fully and also have the favorable rate on the capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.844" offset="9073936">What they claim is that in a few cases where the capital gain comes early in the prescribed eight year period, the absorption without tax benefit may take place, but they have to admit that if the capital gain comes a little later in this prescribed eight year period, giving enough time for ordinary income to accumulate in the first year or two, the loss will be applied against that ordinary income, the favorable rate will be available on the capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.283" offset="9207683">So, it is really a matter of accident within the prescribed period under the Government’s position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.160" offset="9235268">They would treat the Foster class of taxpayers in a fluctuating fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.410" offset="9268287">Some would have all of their loss allowed, some part of it, some get none of their loss allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.831" offset="9297962">What this means to someone like respondent Foster Lumber Company is that according to the Government, Foster Lumber must waste $35,000 of its net operating loss because its capital gain occurred in the first of the possible years whereas its competitor across the street, identical in every way to Foster Lumber Company, can get the net operating loss and get the favorable rate on its taxable gain if only one thing is different and that is if the loss occurred in the second of the possible -- that the capital gain occurred in the second or later of the possible years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.296" offset="10647761">The Government filed a Reply Brief just before the hearing last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.605" offset="10673048">We have filed nothing in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.640" offset="10681198">It was brought out in question by Mr. Justice Stewart with regard since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.613" offset="10709097">I should therefore like to comment briefly, on certain points, on the points made in that Reply Brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.255" offset="10747654">First, the Government there said as it has said again today that the statute is clear and that policy and consequences should play little, if any, part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.448" offset="10796346">Now, on this question of whether the Government’s reading of the statute is plain and clear as it insists, we think reference should be made to the period during which it has been litigating the question and the results it has obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.751" offset="10861652">Perhaps I am repeating here, but I think it is worthy of emphasis that which was brought out on a question by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.752" offset="10897597">The Government took its first position in Chartier and lost in 1969 and as the government counsel indicated, it had fought for five years in the courts of this country to get a conflicting decision, and for five years the courts continued to rule without a dissenting vote that the language was either in favor of the taxpayer or was at least ambiguous, and they all ruled to the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.007" offset="11034583">Not until the Mutual Assurance case was handed down by the Fourth Circuit by a two to one vote that it obtained the conflicting decision that enabled the case to be brought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.965" offset="11090485">In view of that history, it is a little hard to accept the Government’s assertion that the reading of this statute is that plain and clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.009" offset="11126638">It seems to us that it is more fair to say that we are in an area of genuine dispute and we can look not only at the Tax Court for a serious opinion, but also at the opinion of the court below, the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.181" offset="11195288">The Eighth Circuit found both readings of the statute to be equally plausible, but it selected the one that favored the taxpayer because, it said, “It was supported by the basic policy considerations underlying Sections 1201 and 172.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.012" offset="11286612">We think the Court should realize that during the many years that the Government says this question has been open, the Government never before Chartier took a public position on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.076" offset="11346903">The examples in its regulations carefully avoid the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.487" offset="11368532">The regulations are in effect in the language of the statute which does not advance the inquiry very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.211" offset="11391415">The examples might have held, but there is no example in the regulations which helps resolve this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.768" offset="11429659">The IRS never published a ruling on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.119" offset="11455050">In other words, it never communicated to Congress or to the public, any intimation of a view that losses could be absorbed by taxed capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.654" offset="11505205">Perhaps this is why Congress has never seen fit to clarify what now as a matter of controversy before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.249" offset="11559644">I should like to reply now to the Government’s assertion that the taxpayer would not have prevailed under the provisions of the 1939 Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="2944.180" offset="11851275">I think it is normal practice for accountants and tax advisers of corporations to advice their corporations where there is doubt about a matter to take to report it and favorably to themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.357" offset="11948032">The Government did say with respect to the 39 Code, had a similar situation risen under that Code, the taxpayer would have lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.002" offset="11986589">That in 1954, when the Code section was rewritten, the addition of the words to which such loss maybe carried, they admit they were added at that time, but they say, they have no significance because the committee reports did not bring out what the addition of these words was intended to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.245" offset="12075615">We do not see any basis as I have indicated in my answer to the last question, we do not see any bases for the Government’s assertion that the taxpayer would not have prevailed under the 39 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.970" offset="12138517">There is no decided case to that affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.473" offset="12148444">There is no ruling to that affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.332" offset="12159938">The same policy factors were acting then as now and there is a case in the amicus brief of the North River Insurance Company, Merrill against the United States which shows how the term 'net income', the term used instead of taxable income in the 39 Code, could have been construed so as to avoid the unnecessary wasting of the loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.603" offset="12257009">And when the Government asserts that the addition in 1954, the very words relied on the Tax Court are of no significance because the committee reports did not say anything about it, we feel that hardly need to reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.914" offset="12318240">Surely silence in the committee reports cannot properly be used to advance that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.450" offset="12340392">We have analyzed the '54 rewrite and we have put the committee report side-by-side with them and we find at least two conspicuous changes made in Section 172 other than this one, which were not commented upon committee reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.802" offset="12409773">So, I do not think the Government should attempt to make too much out of a decision by a congressional committee to comment only upon those changes which they deem of general importance to large classes of taxpayers, but there is one aspect of the congressional history of the net operating loss provision which we would like to remind the Court of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.635" offset="12521159">During the early new deal years, there was no net operating loss provision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Russell W. Baker</label>
            <text syncTime="3168.802" offset="12749783">The Revenue Act in 1939 introduced the modern net operating loss provision and it allowed two years in which you could carry a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.719" offset="12789489">If you could not get your loss absorbed in those two years, it was gone forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.946" offset="12814357">Since then, they have been expanding this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.879" offset="12826060">We think that has significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.303" offset="12831807">There is only one reason why you expand the period for using losses and that so you can use them, so they will not die and be wasted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.162" offset="12875275">In 1942, they expanded the period to four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.250" offset="12895546">In 1950, they expanded the period to six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.547" offset="12912787">In 1954, to seven years, in 1958 to eight years and yesterday when the President signed the Tax Bill, they had by the 1976 law expanded it to ten years for the carryover of a net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.639" offset="12989169">We say this record exhibits a great and increasing concern by Congress that net operating losses be used and not be wasted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.122" offset="13039115">I would turn now to a point which can strongly affect one’s view of the merits of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.267" offset="13067641">In our brief we showed that under the Government’s position, Foster would be taxed on $396,000 over the three-year period, whereas everyone agrees that the aggregate taxable income for the period is $361,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.631" offset="13133156">The Government in its Reply Brief says, we are wrong about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.535" offset="13148725">Foster was not taxed on more than $361,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.136" offset="13183102">The dispute traces to one computation, the alternative tax in 1966 was 25% of the capital gain of a $167,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.149" offset="13227197">It is agreed that ordinary income was erased by the loss carryback, leaving only 25% capital gains tax to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.517" offset="13260633">If you multiply a $167,000 by 25%, you get the tax of 41,000 which we paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.715" offset="13301489">So, we say that $167,000 of capital gains has been taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.699" offset="13325417">The Government Reply Brief says otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.133" offset="13339105">It says computing the tax on a $132,000 of taxable income by the alternative method, produced the tax of $41,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.560" offset="13388842">Is that true?</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.820" offset="13393858">It does not sound right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.155" offset="13403262">You take 25% of $132,000 and by ordinary arithmetic take that yields a tax in the neighborhood of $33,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.168" offset="13439311">So the $41,000 which we paid is the 25% tax on a $167,000 capital gain, as we argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.285" offset="13483719">To say that it's a tax on a $132,000 is plainly not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.366" offset="13504095">The Government brief does not show any explanation, metaphysical or otherwise to account for the inaccuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.174" offset="13539308">So, we submit again as we did in our basic brief, that Fosters have been taxed on $167,000 of capital gain in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.632" offset="13581104">And if we must waste our loss as the Government contends, we will be taxed on $396,000 over the three-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.302" offset="13627810">In the end, the Government’s attempt to force a wasting of loss in our circumstances is based more than anything else on its often repeated insistence regarding the meaning of the word 'carried', as it appears in the sentence of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.606" offset="13705028">If any court is qualified by close contact with the Internal Revenue Code to pass upon the meaning of the word 'carried' that should be the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.046" offset="13754766">We have mentioned throughout this argument, its pioneer decision in the Chartier case in 1969, the Tax Court has adhered to its reading of the word 'carried' in subsequent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.653" offset="13813175">As recently as 1974, in the Continental Equities case, it declined the Government’s request to reconsider Chartier and said, “We remain convinced of the soundness of Chartier and follow it in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.013" offset="13882661">May it please the Court?</text>
