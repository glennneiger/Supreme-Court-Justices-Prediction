            <label>Mr. Thomas M. Khalil</label>
            <text syncTime="35.787" offset="246403">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.728" offset="258210">This case presents to this Court, the question of whether Miranda versus Arizona and Westover versus United States precludes any good faith non-coercive interrogation, subsequent to a defendant’s exercise of his right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.391" offset="320904">An additional question that is involved in this case, is whether or not the exercise of the right to remain silent relative to one crime, per se precludes any subsequent interrogation relative to a separate and distinct crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.340" offset="376701">Now, the facts in this case arise out of the first-degree murder of a man by the name of Leroy Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.496" offset="405332">The respondent in this case, Mr. Richard Bert Mosley was arrested on April 8, 1971 at about 1:05 in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.936" offset="439082">He was arrested in connection with some unrelated robberies, that is to say robberies unrelated to the murder for which he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.064" offset="475549">The arresting officer in this case, Detective Sergeant James Cowie, initially interviewed the defendant in this case for about 20 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.597" offset="509717">That interview was undertaken after a full advise of rights was given to the respondent and after a waiver of those rights was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.384" offset="544825">After Detective Cowie began to interrogate the defendant in this case, Mr. Cowie began asking Mr. Mosley about the White Tower Robbery, one of the robberies for which he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.858" offset="598742">At that point in time, Mr. Mosley said I do not want to talk about any robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.805" offset="618491">Detective Cowie immediately terminated the question and did not see the defendant again, except to tell him that he would be questioned later by Detective Sergeant Hill of the Homicide Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.425" offset="673034">Mr. Mosley was then taken to the ninth-floor lockup area at about 4 o’clock in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.072" offset="703545">During this time, Detective Sergeant Hill of the Detroit Homicide Section had been talking with an accomplice in the Leroy Williams murder, a man by the name of Anthony Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.345" offset="744714">Mr. Smith at about 4 o’clock or so made certain statements to Mr. Hill, implicating Mr. Mosley as the shooter in the Leroy William slaying.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.486" offset="793198">Detective Hill thereafter at about 06:25 in the evening took Mr. Mosley from the ninth-floor lockup area and took him down to the fifth-floor Homicide Section.At that point in time, Detective Hill gave Mr. Mosley his rights in explicit detail, specifically Mr. Hill had the defendant Mosley read his rights to himself then Detective Hill had Mr. Mosley read the rights out loud so that Detective Hill could ascertain whether or not in fact the defendant could read.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.757" offset="926318">Detective Hill then read the Miranda Rights back to Mr. Mosley, explaining in detail all of the points contained on that document.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.222" offset="964143">At that point, Mr. Mosley testified that he fully understood his rights and in fact he signed the rights form, informing him that he had been informed of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.849" offset="1010745">Defendant Mosley testified -- yes, Your Honor?</text>

            <text syncTime="588.982" offset="2459183">In this particular case, the fact that Detective Hill did not know, I think goes to the fact that it was bona fide investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.015" offset="2487395">It was a good faith police effort by Detective Hill in approaching defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.744" offset="2510278">Now, the Michigan Court of Appeals did not even reach that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.291" offset="2524489">The Michigan Court of Appeals said that this Court intended under Miranda versus Arizona to hold that the mere approaching of a defendant a second time was per se coercive and I would submit that on the record in this case that could in any way be substantiated or justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.463" offset="2589168">That the only way that this case could have been reversed and indeed was reversed was based on the per se rule which as I indicated is contrary to the majorities of the jurisdictions in the United States, both state and federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.198" offset="2636084">Now, it is our position here that what the Michigan Court of Appeals should have done was to look at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogations here and indeed look at the waivers in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.428" offset="2681015">Now, the waivers here razor clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.653" offset="2689896">There is no tenable argument that could be made that these waivers were not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.485" offset="2717273">Now, no questioning whatever occurred in this case prior to obtaining of a waiver by either detective Cowie or detective Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.026" offset="2751441">That is to say there was no coercion used, no trickery used, nothing along that vein in order to get a waiver in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.260" offset="2784355">The waivers were constitutionally procured in this case and it is our position that in fact the confession was constitutionally procured in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.746" offset="2822285">Now, I might point out for the Court’s reference that our assertion as the totality of the circumstances should be the test in this case, is apparently agreed upon by the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.081" offset="2863663">Now, at pages 21 and 31 of his brief and at page 44 in the conclusion of his brief, the respondent indicates that indeed the inquiry that this Court should make is whether or not under the totality of circumstances, whether respondent Mosley under all of the circumstances knowing and voluntarily and intelligently waived his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.553" offset="2957495">Now, that is precisely what we are arguing to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.253" offset="2968362">Now, we do not feel that we are contending for a new rule here in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.846" offset="2982677">It is our position that has always been the rule since Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.557" offset="2997514">That in fact, any new rule here is the rule that has been promulgated by the Michigan Court of Appeals and we submit that that rule ought not to stand in this particular case nor in any other case arising under these same facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.613" offset="3049759">Now, it cannot be disputed here that Mr. Mosley was twice given his rights, in fact, the Court of Appeals found that in their opinion and I do not think it is disputed on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.787" offset="3094481">There were as I mentioned two clean waivers of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.011" offset="3107333">There was not coercion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.823" offset="3114647">There were no threats made to the defendant in order to get him to waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.259" offset="3128336">There was no attempt in this case to subvert his previous exercise of the right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.709" offset="3154145">There was no long incarceration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.137" offset="3163862">This case was a new investigation being handled by a separate bureau, in charge of by a separate police officer, Sergeant Hill, and in fact, the interrogation initially I point out, was only twenty minutes in length, only covered a few preliminary questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.408" offset="3236900">Now, the many Courts that have considered this question, both state and federal courts, have adapted the rule that we are contending for in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.531" offset="3273472">That is to say that as long as any subsequent inquiry respects the rights preciously asserted in the subsequent inquiries undertaken for good faith reasons, there is no reason or whatever to hold the fact that the man exercised his right previously should taint any subsequent voluntarily waiver of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.002" offset="3351317">That is what we are saying in this particular case, that the rights were knowingly waived previously than they were exercised relative to robberies.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.190" offset="3388097">In the second case, there was a knowing and intelligent waiver here and the confession was voluntarily made.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.619" offset="3413802">I point out to the Court that there was no badgering here.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.420" offset="3428953">There was no harassing as Mr. Justice Marshall has inclined to believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="3618.151" offset="14575924">I would also like to point out to the Court that in this particular case, there was no approach by the police telling Mr. Mosley, your rob partners has confessed, come on and waive your rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.999" offset="14615317">In this particular case, no questioning whatever was undertaken by the Detective Hill, until a waiver of rights was obtained, and thereafter, Mr. Mosley was confronted with his confession and I think in the words of Mr. Mosley, the reason he confessed in this case was because he got scared because of that involvement put on him by Mr. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.091" offset="14699640">One other point that I would like to point out to the Court is that the issue of the arrest has been raised in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.874" offset="14726807">It has been our position all through these proceedings that the arrest was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.586" offset="14741645">There are additional factors which counsel for the respondent has not pointed out to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.178" offset="14764006">I will not take up the Court’s time with those factors necessarily except to say that the information that Detective Hill got from Anthony Smith, at that particular point in time probable cause existed to arrest Mr. Mosley for the murder of Leroy Williams and I think that this Court under the analysis undertaken in Brown versus Illinois, could very well find that indeed the confession was not violative of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.629" offset="14877795">It was not the result of any illegal arrest, even assuming that the arrest were unlawful in the first instance, any taint would have sufficiently attenuated and would have made the confession proper in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.980" offset="14931189">I just like to say that in this particular matter, I do not think that there could ever be a case presented to this Court in which the waivers that around this record, the waivers that had been introduced in Court and the conduct of these officers that are on the record here could be anymore admirable than is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.309" offset="15004541">The waivers are crystal clear, razor clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.454" offset="15017080">The behavior of Detective Hill, I think is without question, that of an officer showing respect for Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.915" offset="15046964">The question came from the bench earlier as why the rights were given twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.811" offset="15062533">I think that the reason could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.322" offset="15072564">if we hearken back to Miranda itself, I think that Miranda in this case has taught the police officers to give the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.480" offset="15097224">Those rights were fully complied with here and we would ask this Court to reverse the Michigan Court of Appeals.</text>
