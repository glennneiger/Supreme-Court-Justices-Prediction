            <text syncTime="6.309" offset="98850">This case is here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.570" offset="119852">The respondent, a licensed physician registered under the Controlled Substances Act was convicted of unlawful dispensation of methadone.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.192" offset="162380">This is an addictive drug used in the treatment of Heroine addicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.715" offset="184427">Respondent was found guilty in the District Court of violating Section 841 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.339" offset="210968">A provision making it unlawful for any person knowingly to distribute a controlled substance except as authorized by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.978" offset="257570">The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the ground that respondent was exempted from prosecution under Section 841 by virtue of his status as a registered physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.973" offset="313472">That court concluded that registrant can be prosecuted only under other sections of the Act that prescribed less severe penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.608" offset="355999">We conclude that conviction under Section 841 was duly authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.392" offset="379196">That section reaches any person and we find no justification for construing the Act as imposing lesser penalties on registered physicians and those imposed on other citizens.</text>
