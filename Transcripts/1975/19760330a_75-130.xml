            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103354">We will hear our arguments first this morning in 75-130, Robert Quinn against Muscare.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_quinlan" startTime="26.878" stopTime="423.455">
            <label>Mr. William R. Quinlan</label>
            <text syncTime="26.878" offset="210770">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.220" offset="224144">The fundamental issues presented for review here are, one, whether in suspensions of none probationary state and local governmental employees for a cause, Due Process requires a hearing before the suspension become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.507" offset="289346">Secondly, is Due Process satisfied by a co-suspension hearing where, in the event the charges against the employee are disallowed, he is awarded backpay and the suspension is deleted from the employee’s service record.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.848" offset="346711">Additionally because of the context in which this case comes to this Court, there is a collateral issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.134" offset="367818">That is whether or not the Municipal Fire Departments can constitutionally promulgate rules requiring as firefighters to limit the amount and location of their facial hair for among other reasons to ensure the efficient operation of gas masks that firefighters are required to wear.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.053" offset="443468">The facts are basically as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.424" offset="452977">The respondent Francis Muscare, a Lieutenant in the Chicago Fire Department has been a firefighter with the Chicago Fire Department since 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.839" offset="486623">The Chicago Fire Department as I alluded to earlier has a rule 511.33, limiting the amount of facial hair that maybe worn by firefighters to at most a small mustache and precisely limited sideburns with no beard.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.702" offset="554123">But from October 1973, until the trial of this cause in March 1974, Lieutenant Muscare wore a goatee.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.696" offset="590067">In fact, some three years before, Muscare had worn the same sort of beard.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.572" offset="609607">At that time he had been ordered to shave it off, but refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.603" offset="621728">In consequence at a uniform inspection, the superior officers declined to inspect him.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.671" offset="641999">He then brought himself in to compliance by shaving.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.689" offset="654015">The following year, Mr. Muscare again grew a beard.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.074" offset="667599">This time he was summoned before Departmental Board, consisting of two Fire Chiefs and an instructor in the Fire Academy in the use of safety masks.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.522" offset="697378">At that hearing he was told to shave off the beard again and again Lieutenant Muscare reluctantly complied.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.804" offset="730502">However, in December 1973, when Lieutenant Muscare appeared with his squad at Chicago Fire Department Academy for instruction in a two-day course in the use of self-contained breathing apparatus which were safety masks, he was again wearing a beard.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.463" offset="789121">The instructor was Firefighter, Leonard Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.972" offset="807197">Later at the trial, Johnson testified that during the class, he informed Muscare on the basis of the instruction material that he had been provided with and his experience that facial hair should not be worn with safety mask.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.254" offset="852337">Muscare disputed this and contented that New York and Boston permitted Firefighters to wear long hair and beards.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.638" offset="881803">Each member of the class was expected to put the apparatus on, charge it and test it to determine whether or not he was getting a good facial fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.718" offset="914195">Johnson stated that by watching a firefighter try on the mask, he could tell whether he succeeded in attaining a tight facial seal.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.118" offset="947736">But Muscare failed to test the apparatus in the class at Fire Academy.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.995" offset="963305">I might indicate from the record, it is not clear whether a Lieutenant would be required to do so since he was dealing with the firefighter as an instructor.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.677" offset="994025">However, he did not in fact try on the mask.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.631" offset="1005832">On the second day of class, each student was expected to walk up five floors of the Fire Academy building and then back down to the first floor with the gas mask on, sealed and functioning, Muscare did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.770" offset="1054420">Instructor Johnson stated at the trial that he did not know whether Muscare while wearing his beard could get a good seal on the mask because Muscare did not put the mask on and a gas mask can be tested only by a man putting it on.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.870" offset="1106770">In due course, Instructor Johnson reported Muscare’s conduct in the class to the Drill Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.461" offset="1129130">Muscare was soon in the same month, December 1973, warned that he would not be permitted to continue working unless he shaved off his beard.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.765" offset="1166329">A few days later, Muscare was advised that charges had been filed against him with the Administrative Authorities of the Fire Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.744" offset="1194227">Because of the fortuitous circumstances, the superior with authority to impose a penalty was taken ill with appendicitis, no further action was taken for more than two months.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.446" offset="1233098">Then a suspension of 29 days was issued on February of 1974 to Muscare and he was notified in person by three superior officers who came to his Fire Station and informed him that he was suspended, effective immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.291" offset="1296418">A letter subsequently followed on March 4, 1974 from the Chief of Personnel, Chief Brown, indicated that he was charged of violation of three rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.666" offset="1333930">The first rule was the failure to conform to the grooming code.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.427" offset="1348977">The second rule was his violation of conduct unbecoming a Firefighter and the third violation was his disobedience of a direct and lawful order.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.396" offset="1384921">Muscare did not ask, exercised his statutory right provided for under the Illinois statute, Chapter 24, Section 18-1 to a hearing before the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.833" offset="1434658">The Civil Service Commission is empowered, and in the event it finds the suspension unwarranted, that the employee would be entitled to backpay for the period of the suspension and erasure of the suspension from his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.134" offset="1475827">From an adverse determination of the commission, the employee has a statutory right to judicial review with the right of further appeal to the higher court.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.503" offset="1509264">Muscare failed to exhaust these remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.429" offset="1520967">Instead of exhausting his administrative remedies before the Civil Service Commission, Muscare filed the instant lawsuit under 43 U.S.C. 1983 on March 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.403" offset="1576869">The basic thrust of the complaint dealt with -- asked for declaratory injunctive relief on the grounds that the Grooming Code of the Fire Department infringed upon his constitutional rights and the other two violations that he had been charged with, were both vague, and therefore, overly broad and unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.889" offset="1650848">He also indicated that he did receive Due Process of law in the imposition of this penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.520" offset="1673418">The District Court denied both a temporary and permanent injunction, upheld the validity of the no-beard rule, indicating that Muscare had been afforded Due Process and entered a judgment in favor of the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.733" offset="1718244">Primarily the Court did not look to any of the other two reasons that had been alleged for the basis of this grooming code, one of which was the Fire Department was a Paramilitary organization and as such required discipline and to that grooming code was appropriate in a uniformed force.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.455" offset="1797134">Did the District Court focus on the procedural Due Process question that became the foundation of Court of Appeals’ opinion?</text>

            <label>Mr. William R. Quinlan</label>
            <text syncTime="431.922" offset="1830988">That was primarily not the thrust of the argument before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.481" offset="1845199">It came out on a preliminary injunction and motions were filed in support in opposition to the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.526" offset="1869441">He determined that the facial or the grooming code of the Department was rationally related to safety measures, although other arguments had been made for.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.814" offset="1906534">The issue was raised on a motion for reconsideration and Due Process issues were also raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.689" offset="1926074">He then indicated that his judgment presumed that the Due Process was satisfactorily to comply with the constitution and accordingly the judgment, I would say, was based both upon those grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.785" offset="1994410">That is quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.350" offset="2000680">On appeal, the attention focused then on the Due Process issue as opposed to the validity of the grooming code.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.319" offset="2024608">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, finding that no hearing of any kind was afforded to the appellant prior to his suspension and that post-suspension review provided by state statute would not satisfy the requirements of Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.072" offset="2075599">The Court of Appeals did not deem it necessary to determine whether a trial type proceeding was essential to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.061" offset="2099527">In order, the Court deemed it necessary to pass on the validity of the Fire Department’s no-beard rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.285" offset="2124396">The Court here granted certiorari on March 14, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.573" offset="2141636">As we view the issues, there are several considerations that we believe ought to be taken into consideration in resolving this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.023" offset="2167445">Initially, in a governmental type of employment situation, the argument is raised, whether it is a property interest or some liberty interest violated before Due Process applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.341" offset="2208614">We believe that under the decisions of this Court in dealing with Governmental employees, that any property interest in the job is determined by a state statute or by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.468" offset="2245186">Here we have a state statute which provides for a non-probationary employee to receive certain rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.077" offset="2271622">One of these rights is a hearing, if he is suspended from more than 5 days subsequent to the suspension with a period from one to five days, no hearing is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.760" offset="2310387">For any procedure for a suspension beyond five days, then there is a full blown hearing required before the sanction can be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.220" offset="2344138">He is entitled to counsel, notice of written charges and subpoena powers available both to the Civil Service Commission and to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.226" offset="2376216">So in this context it is our argument that the property right of the individual is determined by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.433" offset="2405055">Once the property right is determined by the statute, the question then becomes what is necessary to accomplish due process of law in that context as we view the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.481" offset="2445179">Under our interpretation of the cases of this Court, particularly Arnett versus Kennedy, it is not required that the individual have a pretrial or pre-suspension hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.753" offset="2490319">Arnett as the Court will recall, was a termination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.453" offset="2505156">This is a suspension case and under these circumstances we believe that the right to a hearing subsequent to the imposition of a suspension of more than five days is adequate Due Process under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.129" offset="2563775">On the five-day position, with one to five days, it would be our contention that the legislature has recognized this as not involving a property right at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.156" offset="2607974">That this would be reviewable only on the basis of an appeal to the Circuit Court by writ of mandamus or perhaps by filing a 1983 Action in United States District Court to review whether the action taken was arbitrary or capricious.</text>

            <text syncTime="742.955" offset="3075148">Yes, I think it is two-fold answer to that, Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.256" offset="3096360">First of all, it was upheld at the District Court level as being a general rule of regulation and as a general rule it could be applied uniformly even though in specific instances, it might not in fact cause any danger or safety problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.344" offset="3268663">So in the first point it was general rule that the Court found that was based upon a rational related basis, namely safety and the expert did testify that in his judgment, facial hair would cause difficulties in getting a secure fit on the mask.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.106" offset="3331775">However, he indicated that because of the structure of individual faces, because of the differences in the dental structure, chins etcetera, that in a particular instance it might not in fact cause the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1702.146" offset="6911909">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.027" offset="6923403">My name is Linda Hirshman and I represent respondent Lieutenant Francis Muscare in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.761" offset="6946391">In light of your questions of Mr. Quinlan, I think would like to begin with the issue of what a hearing might have consisted of, had respondent been allowed or provided with even the most rudimentary hearing prior to his 29-day suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.442" offset="7001039">The record in this case demonstrates that respondent was suspended from his employment for 29 days, based on three violations or alleged violations of three Chicago Fire Department rules and regulations, the rule prescribing proper personal appearance, the rule forbidding disobedience of orders and the rule forbidding conduct unbecoming a member or employee of the Chicago Fire Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.826" offset="7102603">At no time until the hearing in Federal Court on his constitutional claims, did respondent find out from petitioner what underlying facts were involved in their charges against him?</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.269" offset="7152340">However, based on these charges alone, obviously there are several levels at which respondent could have utilized a prior hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.703" offset="7194136">First of all, on the question of proper personal appearance; on the bare facts at issue here, what you have is the administration taking a look at respondent and making their determination without ever finding out from him for example whether his self-contained breathing apparatus fits which he testified without rebuttal at trial, it did with no problem at drill in fighting fires.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.269" offset="7296327">But Ms. Hirshman there is no proviso in the regulation is that you are exempt from it if your self-contained breathing apparatus fits?</text>

            <text syncTime="1805.283" offset="7324435">MNow, that really speaks to the fact that of the City -- the petitioner adhered so tenaciously to the fact that the only justification for the regulation was the safe use of the self-contained breathing apparatus and indeed we would go to mitigation, if not to the substantive violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.214" offset="7400190">The Fire Commissioner has a range of penalties which he can impose for violation of the range of rules involved in the Fire Department Rules and Regulations of which respondent was accused of violating three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.932" offset="7455047">He could have chosen a reprimand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.028" offset="7463406">He could have chosen as acting Chief Fire Marshal Foley did initially in December to do nothing to respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.969" offset="7495171">Furthermore, respondent had numerous things to say on the subject of disobedience of orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.192" offset="7524115">Disobedience of orders is a classic factual issue, involving questions of the authority to give the order which we saw -- discussed here just a moment ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="2372.205" offset="9592072">Yes, the problem with the hearing in addition to the fact that it is not guaranteed at any time relative to the suspension that is at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.669" offset="9617986">There is no guarantee of promptness in the statute whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.776" offset="9630420">Statute is silent about the timing of the later hearing, but in addition to that at the later hearing under the existing law, Lieutenant Muscare has to bear the burden of proving that the suspension was wrongful, based on a letter which had nothing, but three rule numbers on it and with that kind of notice, without ever hearing it, as it turned out, we have found out in the trial in Federal Court, what Chief Foley or part of what Chief Foley had in his mind, but without ever hearing that and nothing, but that letter under the Illinois Law his later hearing, he has to go to the later hearing and disprove for example conduct unbecoming a member employee of the Chicago Fire Department without ever knowing what underlay those charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.216" offset="9820174">And so the later hearing is obviously insufficient under any circumstances and it is my understanding that there is no issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.290" offset="9868448">First of all, because we are suing under 1983 and secondly because as this Court recently pointed out in Matthews versus Aldrich where you have a claim that your right to a prior hearing has been violated, then you do not have to exhaust in order to bring your constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.854" offset="9942740">So I think that the paucity of -- the real lack of value of the later hearing is illustrated by all of these things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.306" offset="10488490">He had a really substantially protective procedure before the deprivation was imposed and my understanding of this Court’s recent writing in Boehning, that is the proper pronunciation versus Indiana State Employees Association is that the question of -- that Arnett did not determine that a public employee could be suspended or discharged without any prior procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.713" offset="10614192">Indeed this Case stands in the most -- the greatest contrast to Arnett versus Kennedy because for every protective procedure in Arnett, there is a complete void of protective procedures here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.537" offset="10681483">In place of 30-days advanced notice, Fire Marshals walked into Lieutenant Muscare’s Fire station and told him to turn in his badge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.251" offset="14152321">One, the reasons for the 29 days as observed on page 134 of the abstract where of this severity of the sanction was given because the fact has occurred before and he had not shaved the beard off at the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.199" offset="14200072">Page 105, the abstract indicates that Chief Fire Marshall Foley never indicated that he would not take sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.856" offset="14226717">One of their observations I would like to make is that I think we do have to have some minimal guides in terms to standards in what Due Process requires, when we are talking about applying sanctions to some 40,000 employees and the city decides, the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.489" offset="14281261">Finally, in its order on page 161 of the abstract, the Court of Appeals indicates that he was warned, that he could not continue as a firefighter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.149" offset="14311876">I do not think that whether he was actually warned, he could not continue as a firefighter or not is of any real substantial dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.882" offset="14338835">He was told that he was to shave off his beard and the charges had been filed.</text>
