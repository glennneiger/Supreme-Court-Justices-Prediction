            <text syncTime="45.875" offset="286839">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.813" offset="302513">This proceeding comes before you with a history of 6 years in which the EEOC, the FPC, the Justice Department, the Civil Service Commission and others have been seeking an answer to a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.673" offset="366042">That question is the proper interrelation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Laws and Economic Regulatory Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.897" offset="414839">We have tried three approaches to get a definitive answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.963" offset="427169">We have tried administrative procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.375" offset="436782">We have tried the legislative route and we have tried the judicial route, in all of them we have failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.104" offset="467711">What we now require is for this Court to set defenses by which Economic Regulatory Agencies, Equal Employment Opportunity Agencies like the EEOC, the Regulated Gas and the Electric Utility Industry and others may function.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="111.128" offset="547855">Mr. Journey, your statement at what you now require from this Court is such and such raises a question in my mind that bothered me while reading the briefs and bothering the Court of Appeals opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.034" offset="595397">It seems to me that there is a certain abstractness about the question that is presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.979" offset="615251">I do not know whether it is standing or a case or controversy or rightness.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.657" offset="633954">But obviously this Court does not just respond to the request of both parties to tell us, to tell you what you can do and what cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.187" offset="672093">You have got to show that you have got a concrete controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.572" offset="685572">And I am somewhat disturbed by the fact that this was not any specific attack on a rate hearing or license application but simply a request for a rule and the FPC turned it down because it had no jurisdiction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="drexel_d_journey" startTime="161.401" stopTime="443.734">
            <label>Mr. Drexel D. Journey</label>
            <text syncTime="161.401" offset="748893">You Honor, if you look at the history of this, the PG&amp;E case which is quoted in the Commission’s Declaratory Order Number 623.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.104" offset="791734">You will see that this controversy started out in a FPC Hydro Licensing case raised initially by the California Rural Legal Assistance Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.792" offset="842516">The matter in that case was whether economic – the issue – the precise issue there and here is whether economic regulatory statutes are an alternative enforcement strategy for the Equal Employment Opportunity Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.499" offset="925272">The PG&amp;E case, 44 FPC, that is quoted in the Declaratory Order 623 did not go to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.169" offset="963933">The Commission when it faced the issue in the PG&amp;E case invited the NAACP in.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.736" offset="990264">They invited others in to hear the points of whether there was jurisdiction and whether economic regulatory laws could be used as an enforcement strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.900" offset="1046898">The commission concluded in the PG&amp;E case that it could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.448" offset="1077095">The NAACP then brought a general proceeding which culminated in opinion 623 which was directed basically to the gas and electric utility industry throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.336" offset="1144596">We think that the question is important and should be resolved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.988" offset="1179286">We think it is right for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.709" offset="1194124">NAACP argues that there is a constitutional requirement that the Power Commission have affirmative action employment regulatory programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.760" offset="1250339">They argue also that under the public interest concept, there is enfolded within the umbrella of the public interest notion, a requirement in the Power Commission to resolve these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.909" offset="1314914">The Court of Appeals said, no, said, when you look at the function of a regulatory agency such as the FPC you must look at its delegated authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.558" offset="1365487">It found that we had under the Power and Gas Act, three things to do basically, we were to look at the conservation of natural resources, we were to look adequacy of supply of electric energy and natural gas and that we were to protect the consumer from exploitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.519" offset="1457334">The Court went on after making that finding and holding that we had no jurisdiction to determine what employment practices should be to reach into the operation of the economic regulatory function and it found in our ability to disallow costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.303" offset="1552524">What I call an ancillary jurisdiction in the commission, which seems to say by reason of the things the Court of Appeals would have us do, namely get the EEOC forms and let people intervene who claim they were victims of discrimination and unequal employment hearings and opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.759" offset="1658372">Well, we think what this comes down is an endless procession of litigation for us in terms of, why would we hear these questions, if we are not being told by the Court of Appeals that we can do indirectly that thing which they said we could not do directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.349" offset="1744681">They said we could not regulate employment practices per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.264" offset="1764325">Now when we discussed this matter with the Solicitor General, the Solicitor General said that he thought the case had been properly decided by the Court of Appeals holding that we do not have a regulatory jurisdiction per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.223" offset="1828168">We think that in looking at the additional findings of the Court, they posed a most difficult situation for the commission to administer—</text>

            <text syncTime="470.250" offset="1984276">Your Honor, we think that the Court of Appeals decision suggests that we can, one, either deny rate relief or deny a certificate because of what might be our independent views of what should be their employment practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.145" offset="2167864">Suppose that the FPC on its own, now in a rate proceeding was asked to give rate relief to a company and it thought that the company was engaged in illegal employment practices, which if cured would lower their costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.774" offset="2250411">Would you have the power under your present statute to tell the company that you would not give them rate relief because they have – because the legal cost would not justify it?</text>
