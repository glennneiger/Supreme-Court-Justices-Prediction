            <text syncTime="31.172" offset="228024">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.330" offset="240668">This is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Jersey which upheld against federal constitutional challenge, a municipal ordinance, which requires that any person who wishes to call from house to house in support of a political campaign or cause must, first, identify himself with the municipal police in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.969" offset="359159">Probable jurisdiction was noted in the past term of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.855" offset="374728">Now, Your Honors, there are one or two twists in the litigation history of the case which are irrelevant to the posture in which the case now comes before the Court and which I believe and hope, are adequately explained in the statement and in our brief to which, I believe, my brother at the bar here has taken no exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.598" offset="453722">So, I am going to content myself with a very brief summary which I hope the Court will find sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.795" offset="482457">The defendant appellee here, the Borough of Oradell, has, at least since 1971, had what has come to be known as a Green River Ordinance, affecting house to house calling by commercial solicitors, salesman and solicitors for commercial purposes that, being the local state of the law in Oradell.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.444" offset="573050">In March 1973, the Appellant Hynes who was then a member of New Jersey Assembly and a candidate for re-nomination and reelection, and to whose constituency the Borough of Oradell had just been added by a statewide reapportionment, in March 1973, Hynes went to Oradell and commenced a campaign from house to house.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.630" offset="685794">The police had accosted him and made him stop canvassing and asked him to leave the Borough although, of course, ordinance then in effect did not cover this situation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.007" offset="739293">A very few weeks after that, the Borough of Oradell enacted the ordinance extending its coverage to solicitors for charitable contributions and any person campaigning for a political -- canvassing for a political campaign or cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.413" offset="877010">Right, the ordinance having been enacted, the appellant Hynes and four other plaintiffs, likewise appellants here who were residents of Oradell, Hynes himself was not though Oradell was part of the constituency, four residents brought a suit for declaratory and an injunctive relief focusing their complaint under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.597" offset="997696">They prevailed in the lower Courts on a combination of state and federal grounds, but between the time in the lower Courts and the time when the case reached the Supreme Court of New Jersey, a further amendment to the ordinance eliminated the state questions and so the New Jersey Supreme Court reviewed the case squarely on the basis of the federal constitution and upheld the ordinance by a vote of 5 to 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.626" offset="1105843">Parenthetically, I should note that on the same day, the day they decided this case, they rendered their decision in the Collingswood case which involved a wholly different kind of solicitation ordinance from another borough and there is some cross reference between the opinions in the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.044" offset="1183479">Therefore, we have included the opinion in the Collingswood case in our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.462" offset="1201138">That case is pending here on appeal and I believe the Court has taken no action on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.601" offset="1225693">Now, the ordinance in the form in which the Supreme Court of New Jersey reviewed it is in our brief on pages 3 and 4 to which I invite the Court’s attention for just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.662" offset="1282013">I think the Court will see on page 3 where the “whereas” clauses explain the purpose of the ordinance that are set out; that the explicit and exclusive purpose of the statute is public safety against crime, the theory being that people on a pretext of soliciting votes will then engage in breaking and entering or larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.918" offset="1378979">On the operative clause of the ordinance on page 4, the Court will see that it covers any person who is canvassing for charitable cause or for any federal state county or municipal political campaign or cause, that such a person must notify the police department in writing for identification and that one notification is sufficient for the duration of the campaign or cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.019" offset="2515410">Of course, it seems to me that would be -- whether going beyond that is permissible or not must depend upon assessing how deep is the infringement on First Amendment here and how great is the municipal interest that requires a restriction and that is what I propose to address myself to now.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.796" offset="2594509">With respect to the depth of the infringement here, both in terms of the scope and the depth, I would like to make some observations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.123" offset="5467770">The point on vagueness, which I will just take a minute on if I may; once again the New Jersey Court seems to have thought that the ordinance was crystal clear and it certainly is clear enough in terms of the kinds of speech that it covers, that is, the charitable solicitation, the political counseling, and so forth, but I submit that the notifying in writing for identification only is quite insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.077" offset="5579574">What can the police legitimately require for identification purposes?</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.267" offset="5600367">As far as the record shows, they have put out no rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.716" offset="5610189">They have put out no forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.014" offset="5623355">The Police Chief has made a couple of remarks about it in his affidavit, but of course, they do not seem to be in any way binding on him or his successor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.036" offset="5659508">If the purpose of the ordinance is to help the police to know where canvassing is going on, it would seem to require some indication of where in the Borough you are going to be or this does not say one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.971" offset="5707156">Are these lists to be kept confidential or made public or this does not help us?</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.434" offset="5725024">It seems to me, they are just too many questions left unanswered here and I refer the Court to Justice Pachman’s dissent below where he stresses, it seems to me very effectively, the special risks of harassment, discriminatory enforcement and so forth, that in here in the vague quality of this restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.375" offset="5824811">Now in conclusion, may I say, that with the very -- with the total lack of any indication need here with the obvious effect that it is going to have on a political process on neighborhood discussion that the whole balance here was misjudged below and that the case calls for reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.251" offset="6260325">We do have a small community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.074" offset="6275580">We do not have what you would call policemen on regular troll and what not, and we have people coming into the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.237" offset="6312256">I am going to say, for instance, Justice Jackson pointed this out in one of his dissenting opinions, what happens and it will lead up to what I say is the reason we adapt these ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.582" offset="6361680">People will come to town in a colony and they will descend on your town and they will debauch a group of canvassers and through your town they go knocking at doors, “we are soliciting this,” “we are soliciting that,” and so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.711" offset="6450183">Now, as I point out in my brief and I think as Justices will recognize, the man who has in mind casing a house for future burglary does not announce that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.041" offset="6503472">He is going on the guise of a solicitor whether for a charitable campaign or whatever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.934" offset="6535028">Now, ever since this Court laid down the decision in the Valentine case, we have taken the position that commercial free speech, if I can coin the phrase, is subject to regulation and, in some cases, to prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.880" offset="6602842">Now, we have adapted and you will find it, if you ask counsel about the initial ordinance, you will find it at E1 which is our original canvassing ordinance and you will notice there that the person who applies for a permit must fill out a form, answer certain questions, and the like, describe the goods that he is soliciting, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.582" offset="6713601">Those ordinances have been upheld in the State of New Jersey and I understand, are not attacked here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.429" offset="6737007">Now, we take a step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.941" offset="6747038">We have people come to the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.615" offset="6753726">They say “we are soliciting votes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.063" offset="6767518">“We are running for this,” “we are running for that,” and “we want to go from house to house.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.818" offset="6790610">Now, as carefully as I have read the decisions of this Court, and I read them in preparing this particular ordinance, I have found nowhere does it say there is a premise that a person has a right to ring my doorbell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.345" offset="6884651">I may forbid him and the Court probably is familiar with buildings where there are signs, “solicitors prohibited,” “soliciting prohibited,” and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.287" offset="6932508">Now, these people come in and say “we are soliciting” or “running for office,” so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.328" offset="6964586">The question then is, should we have some idea who they are?</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.310" offset="6984544">And, I think when counsel says “there is nothing in the record to indicate why this was done, I think the Court would really sit up in its respective chairs, if I said that we have 12 unsolved murders in our vicinity, and therefore, there is fear in the minds of the householders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.888" offset="7082868">Now, you may say “well, it is an unjustifiable fear.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.165" offset="7095930">It is one of the incidents you have to put up with in living in civilized society, but if a legislative body is going to be responsive to the will of its people, it has to recognize these conditions, and therefore, the First Amendment to this ordinance was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.478" offset="7169177">Now, here is where we had trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.876" offset="7178790">It came before the Trial Judge on the return of an order to show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.044" offset="7199479">There was not a plenary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.057" offset="7207525">No testimony was taken, and counsel who then appeared for Mr. Hynes and his fellows, took the position that this was an unreasonable regulation and I emphasize that position, an unreasonable regulation of the right of free speech, and it was on that hypothesis that the case was argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.864" offset="7306790">Along came the Trial Judge, and counsel and I are agreed on one thing, it is very hard to follow that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.227" offset="7332181">I do not know whether it was correctly transcribed or what, but the upshot of it was that he said that if you are running for office, you do not have to comply with any regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.409" offset="7384948">You are right to run for office is absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.657" offset="7397905">Now, I know of no decision by this Court, going back to Justice Black and the other who were absolutists to the effect to the right of free speech was not subject to regulation, which took that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.414" offset="7452971">So, we try I might say, parenthetically, the amended ordinance was defective because it had no sanctions and an ordinance without sanctions is no ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.239" offset="7500305">So, we amended it and amended it in the light of the challenge that was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.177" offset="7524024">Compare the amended ordinance with the one which you will find at E1 which requires answer to questions, identification, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.329" offset="7564671">The only requirement that we put in here, and we thought we were compliant not, Justice Brennan, the idea of keeping democrats out of Oradell or anything of the sort, but with the idea of analyzing competing principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.686" offset="7638023">Surely, a man has a right to run for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.732" offset="7646277">Surely, he has a right to solicit signatures on nominating petitions and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.662" offset="7665921">Also, we ought to have some idea of who you are, and therefore, we only said one thing, identify yourself in writing to the Police Chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.382" offset="7712837">Say you are Mr. Hynes and you are going to be in Oradell soliciting house to house.</text>

            <text syncTime="2089.034" offset="8459417">Now, contrary wise, Justice Harshman on whom the appellant relies and comments him on his learning, says this “the Oradell ordinance,” and I am reading from A11, “the Oradell ordinance which, in its amended form, merely requires a single registration by each canvasser during each campaign solely for purposes of identification would on its face appear to impose no serious burden on the exercise of First Amendment rights.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2168.177" offset="8776021">Now, Justice Pachman, in his dissenting opinion referred to some of the cases which are before this Court, particularly those involving Jehovah Witnesses and the like where they were very much in the minority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2548.252" offset="10296348">Mr. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.511" offset="10305334">Do you see anything in the ordinance, Mr. Taylor, that requires you to identify the particular objective of your solicitation, that is, would it be sufficient if you sent a postcard and said “beginning next week, I intend to solicit support for my favorite candidate in the upcoming election”?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="2579.430" offset="10421004">If the question, Your Honor, is whether it can be done by a postcard, that is to say by mail, that is one matter to which the New Jersey Court did advert, but in a somewhat ambivalent way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.544" offset="10473458">It is on page A5 of the appendix and the Court said “the requirement may be satisfied in writing” suggesting that resort may be had to the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.048" offset="10531554">I was going to make reference to that in connection with Justice Powell’s question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.651" offset="10553915">Of course, that does not seem to me to be an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.634" offset="10565827">It is a suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.723" offset="10570215">This might be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.113" offset="10579724">I believe that my basic answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, is that on most of these matters the ordinance is impossibly vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.717" offset="10614206">It does not tell us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.916" offset="10619012">I think it does tell us the answer to Justice White’s question about campaigns because there is this sentence that the notification shall be good for the duration of a campaign or cause and it is hard to see how that can be implemented unless the campaign or cause is specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.248" offset="10684318">Whether you have to say which side of the campaign, Your Honor, is a further question which, again, I think the ordinance gives us no answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.391" offset="10712844">Might I just say, again, in response to Justice Powell’s colloquy with my brother at the bar here, I think, he remarked that the ordinance is not yet in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.651" offset="10753908">I do not believe that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.772" offset="10762372">The relief granted by the Trial Court was declaratory only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.780" offset="10778464">That, of course, was reversed in the Supreme Court and my understanding is that the ordinance is in effect what the practical result has been in terms of the administration of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.653" offset="10821931">The record is, of course, silent on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.076" offset="10831649">I believe the ordinance is now in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2687.200" offset="10852129">New Jersey practice, if you are that familiar with it, could not the Courts, as most Courts could, have a narrowing construction of this ordinance say that you need not specify a party or a candidate, but merely are required to say that you will be soliciting support in connection with that election?</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.327" offset="11344589">I think we have to bear in mind that, with political canvassing, contrary to the impression one gets from this ordinance, it is not very effectively done until the latter part of the afternoon or evening when the working members of the family of which ever sex, Mr. Chief Justice, are at home when one would go canvassing until that was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.194" offset="11416060">So that the emphasis here on the daylight hours and all when the working man or a woman is away, it seems to be wrong in this place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.581" offset="11441660">I do not believe in some summary that the ordinance exhibits a rational connection between the announced objective and the terms it imposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2855.957" offset="11527133">Well, certainly the impingement of First Amendment values would be much than a 9 p.m. case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.992" offset="11547299">I have stressed that because of the recent decisions of this Court have exhibited great solicit to for the function of canvassing and their privacy too.</text>
