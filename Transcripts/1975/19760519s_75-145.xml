            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73685">The other case Northern Cheyenne Tribe versus Hollowbreast comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.296" offset="118825">The 1926 Northern Cheyenne Allotment Act, reserved coal and other mineral deposits underlying lands on the reservation allotted to the Indians, reserved those mineral deposits for Tribe's benefits, but provided that 50 years from the effective date of that Act which would be in this year 1946, the minerals would become the property of the respective allottees.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.980" offset="305548">In 1968, however, when of these Coal deposits became very valuable, Congress amended the 1926 Act to give the Tribe the right to the minerals in perpetuity and a question arose whether the original 1926 Act had given the allottees a vested interest, which Congress without paying just compensation could not deprive them as it sought to do by the 1968 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.274" offset="462701">The District Court in this held that the allottees had not been given any vested interest by the 1926 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.218" offset="514527">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.995" offset="533649">We agree with the District Court and accordingly reverse the Judgment of the Court of Appeals. Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
