            <label>Mr. S. Stephen Rosenfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="55.446" offset="327125">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.462" offset="339246">This is an appeal from the order of a Three-judge court in the District of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.583" offset="363697">The majority of that court enjoined the defendants from enforcing Mass General Law's Chapter 112, Section 12P and related sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.859" offset="404761">The majority also declared that Section 12P was unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.440" offset="427122">This statute was originally enacted on August 2, 1974 and it provides that before an unmarried minor in this case, a child under 18, may obtain an abortion, the physician involved must obtain both her consent and the consent of her parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.395" offset="506952">Importantly, if either parent refuses, a state court Judge is explicitly authorized by the statute to give his consent for good cause shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.194" offset="554077">The action is brought by the plaintiffs on October 30, 1974, the day before Section 12P was to go into effect and the principal plaintiffs were Gerald Zupnick, a physician performing abortions and two pregnant minors who were seeking abortions without the knowledge of their parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.821" offset="632654">A single judge entered a temporary order restraining the enforcement of 12P and convened a Three-judge Court and subsequently granted intervention to parents of unmarried minor daughters in Massachusetts and those intervenors are represented today by Mr. Brian Riley whose argument will follow mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.919" offset="713006">The Three-judge Court after four days of hearings issued its opinion on April 28, 1975 and the majority found the Section unconstitutional on its face because it invaded fundamental privacy interest of minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.498" offset="783328">The court acknowledged that all the experts both the plaintiff’s experts and the defendant’s experts believed that parental involvement was very important and helpful to the child at this crucial time.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.591" offset="831707">The Court, however, construed the statute on its own and found that in its view, the statute created parental rights that were independent of the interest of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.693" offset="884160">Therefore, asserted the court, parents would be authorized under the statute to refuse consent in order to punish the child or for other misguided reasons.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="207.179" offset="934107">Did the Three-judge District Court had the benefit of any state court construction in reaching that interpretation?</text>

            <text syncTime="213.359" offset="958766">No, it did not, Your Honor, because the statute in fact had never been allowed to go into effect and no case had therefore come up to the state court.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="223.158" stopTime="234.847">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="223.158" offset="997950">Did the Three-judge Court give any consideration or was it asked to give any consideration to abstaining in order to prevent the Massachusetts Courts to interpret the meaning of the statute?</text>

          <turn speaker="s_stephen_rosenfeld" startTime="234.847" stopTime="263.489">
            <label>Mr. S. Stephen Rosenfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="234.847" offset="1044761">Yes, it was asked to abstain, Your Honor, and it decided that such abstention was unnecessary without giving reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.838" offset="1080706">Therefore, it will be argued that a quite apart from abstention, the existence of the judicial review provision provides the opportunity for a narrowing construction in the state court, and therefore, justifies a finding that at least on its face, the statute is not invalid because of this opportunity for a narrowing construction.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="263.489" offset="1159282">Well, then you say in affect that even though the Three-judge Court is not to abstained, it was obligated to construe the State Statute more narrowly than it did?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="s_stephen_rosenfeld" startTime="276.606" stopTime="308.363">
            <label>Mr. S. Stephen Rosenfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="276.606" offset="1211736">I am suggesting that there were alternatives, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.808" offset="1220618">It could have abstained, but even if it decided that this was the kind of case, it should decide on the merits since the only attack was a facial attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.360" offset="1258756">The existence of a good cause provision for the state court to grant consent was sufficient basis for finding that at least on its face, the statute was valid because a state court utilizing common law principles well established in Massachusetts might narrow the statute to come within constitutional limits.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="308.363" stopTime="321.906">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="308.363" offset="1338796">So, you say that the Three-judge District Court should have left the statute standing and in particular cases, perhaps there might have been an unconstitutional application, but it would be sufficient for that evil for the day, so to speak?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="321.906" offset="1392921">That is right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.997" offset="1405356">On this very point, the District Court found that the provision in the statute for consent to the abortion by a state court Judge would not protect the child’s privacy interest because, again, in a District Court’s view, it was part of a statute enacted for the benefit of parents and not for children.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.837" offset="1632725">Perhaps, she is not capable of making any.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.576" offset="1655609">May the parents go to the doctor and the child has nothing to say about it?</text>

            <text syncTime="393.287" offset="1678492">Not on the face of the statute, Your Honor, because on the statute requires that the physician obtain a consent of both the minor and their parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.529" offset="1711511">So, it contemplates that at least in the first instance, the judgment of the child will be taken into account, but in addition, the judgment of the parents will also be given the opportunity to participate in a decision for the minor’s abortion.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="421.058" offset="1789565">In what other areas under Massachusetts law is the consent, the affirmative consent of a minor required to be given?</text>

            <label>Mr. S. Stephen Rosenfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="432.979" offset="1837212">Your Honor, there are a number of provisions and in fact, they are set out in the dissent to District Court's opinion in a footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.982" offset="1885277">They deal in areas of adoption and various kinds of licenses on the consent of parents is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.528" offset="1947449">Specifically, Your Honor, as an example, no child -- in the adoption of a minor child the consent of both that minor child and the natural parents is required before the adoption can be approved by a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.974" offset="2041280">Final point, I wanted to make about the District Court’s opinion is that the District Court found that parental consent was unnecessary because in the Court’s own words, a substantial number of minor females on their own were capable of informed consent about whether or not to have an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.416" offset="2131037">Today in our argument, the state will focus briefly on three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.652" offset="2151935">First, the rights and interests of parents and child under the Fourteenth Amendment and Section 12P.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.491" offset="2179311">Second, the state's interest in enacting 12P and finally the important role that the statute gives to the state court to authorize the consent or to authorize an abortion for good cause shown where individual circumstances so suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.221" offset="2266247">State’s view of the daughter’s rights and the parent’s interests are decidedly different from either the plaintiff’s or the intervenor’s or the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.043" offset="2321522">With regards to parents, contrary to the District Court and to intervenors, the state does not believe that this statute or any other source in law gives parents the right to refuse consent for reason other than the child’s wellbeing.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.777" offset="2384425">We do believe that parents have an interest, the interest in assessing what will best serve the child’s needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.077" offset="2413682">Parent's interest we believe is a derivative one and is entirely a function of their greater relative capacity for judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.096" offset="2449731">Thus, we believe it was wrong for the District Court to separate out and exalt what it labeled as parental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.360" offset="2482750">With regard to minors, we believe that minors have a constitutionally protected interest in privacy and it includes the abortion decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.470" offset="2527262">However; in legislation affecting minors, the state may take account of differences in capacity between minors and adults and enact broader legislation for minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.332" offset="2582642">In other words, it is the state’s position that adults and children both have rights of privacy protected by the constitution, but the state may pursue different and important interests when legislating specifically for minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.382" offset="2654845">Turning to the interests of the state which justified the requirement of parental consent, they are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.931" offset="2685042">First, the statute seeks to support the role of the family in a situation where the need for family and family support is plainly called into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.305" offset="2726525">It assumes not the parents will be punitive, but they will be supportive and assisted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.219" offset="4466175">I believe, Your Honor, that the legislature in enacting any statute can only deal specifically with so many situations and the responsibility beyond that is to provide a process whereby additional individual circumstances can be dealt with to avoid the rigidity and over breadth that would otherwise be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.715" offset="4552170">It is important in our view to know, Your Honor, that this is the only statute of all the parental consent provisions dealt with by lower courts that provides explicitly for the involvement of a state court and provides that the state court quite apart from what the parents have done, may provide the consent and I want to turn now, Your Honor, to that judicial review provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.869" offset="4664810">We believe that in the end, the state recognizes that there has to be a process to focus directly on the child’s interest and privacy and by giving a state court a role, the state believes that Section 12P provides the kind of flexibility and satisfies this need to take account of individual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.464" offset="4755194">There are specifically two common law principles that the state court is likely to use in applying 12P's good cause standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.526" offset="4787481">First is to mature minor role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.685" offset="4796049">It is a well-established common law rule in Massachusetts that when the minor shows a capacity for informed judgment, the rationale for parental consent ceases and the Court should authorize an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.138" offset="4849862">It is important to point out that with this common law rule, Your Honor, this is not a conclusive or irrebuttable presumption that the statute sets up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.796" offset="4884552">It is a irrebuttable presumption and the process is provided where by that presumption can be rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.247" offset="4910361">The second common law principle is the Court’s independent responsibility to act in the child’s best interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.685" offset="4944111">Even if the mature, minor rule does not apply, the common law compels in Massachusetts that the consent be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.411" offset="4975040">If the Court making its own independent assessment finds that abortion would be in the child’s best interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.672" offset="5627997">The first, the threshold question it would have to decide before deciding whether or not to consent of the abortion, it would have to decide whether or not the parents should be notified, and whether or not the hearing should be held.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.029" offset="6117427">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.160" offset="6129966">At the outset, we wish to make it clear that this is not an abortion case in our mind, but rather deals with the issues of medical treatment of minors and informed consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.896" offset="6172911">The fundamental issue raised by this appeal is whether the parents would be given the opportunity to exercise their right and duty to guide and protect their children in medical decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.950" offset="6217111">This includes abortions as well as all other medical decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.719" offset="6236232">The intervenors submit that Roe versus Wade and Doe versus Bolton lend no support to the plaintiff’s contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.665" offset="6264027">Wade and Bolton involved an adult woman’s right to effectuate a reasoned and informed decision to terminate a pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.357" offset="6298822">These cases concerned adult woman who have always been considered capable of giving a valid and informed consent to medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.840" offset="6328706">In the present case, however, we are concerned of minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.252" offset="6342394">Minors have always been deemed incapable as a class of giving an informed consent to medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.186" offset="6370084">The Court in Bolton held that an abortion is merely a medical procedure and should not be differentiated from other medical procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.324" offset="6398609">The same is true of minors who seek medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.837" offset="6412716">They should not be treated differently than minors who seek other forms of medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.374" offset="6442809">The Lower Court acknowledged this fact when it held that Dr. Zupnick could not legally perform abortions on minors that were not capable of giving an informed consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.637" offset="6479902">The Lower Court found, however, that it was insignificant that there were certain number of minors who are capable of in fact giving an informed consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.720" offset="6516265">The Court nevertheless found that in determining whether a particular minor is or is not capable of giving an informed consent that there would be factual questions to weigh in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.803" offset="6560569">The essence of this appeal is who should weigh these factual questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.932" offset="6577078">Who should determine whether a particular girl is capable of giving an informed consent?</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.627" offset="6595886">Who should assist her in this decision making process?</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.950" offset="6609156">Should it be the doctor, should it be her parents, or should it be a judge of the Superior Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.487" offset="6631308">The intervenors submit that the parents, at least in the first instance, should aid her in this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.518" offset="6655445">This is in accord with a long line of decisions which hold that the care, custody, and nurture of children reside first in parents and in no one else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.607" offset="6695778">The intervenors submit that parents at least in this first instance, should be given the opportunity, opportunity to guide their children in this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.089" offset="6729738">This is not only their right, but it is also their duty and obligation to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.127" offset="6749904">All the experts in this case agree that an unplanned pregnancy for a minor girl is accompanied by a great period of stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.414" offset="6783027">These girls are typically scared, frightened, they are desperate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.750" offset="6800373">One expert described these girls as upset, withdrawn, non-communicative, and anxious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.711" offset="6836213">Expert testimony reveals that such an adolescent is often compelled to seek an immediate solution to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.355" offset="6862753">They want instant relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.736" offset="6872262">It is crucial at this point, that this decision to abort be the product of an informed and reasoned consent, and not merely a desire for instant relief from the crisis she faces at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.580" offset="6927641">The minor girl is entitled to and must obtain proper guidance in assessing the risk, the complications, and the alternatives to the abortion procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.985" offset="6973303">This guidance is generally supplied to her in all other surgical procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.410" offset="6995037">It is important that the girl resolve in her mind, that whatever choice she makes, is the product of reflection and not a reaction to the crisis that she is in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.538" offset="7039550">All of the experts agreed that parental support and guidance is extremely necessary to help a child through this difficult period in her life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.945" offset="7077166">It is submitted that the great majority of parents will provide their children with the proper guidance and support that they are entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.210" offset="7110185">Parents are the ones who are most interested in ensuring that their daughter receives proper medical care and guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.648" offset="7139965">Parents are best suited to aid her in choosing a doctor and a medical facility which offers the quality of interest and sensitivity that can deal with this delicate problem for the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.044" offset="7189493">Finally, parental concern and involvement will ensure that there is proper follow-up medical care for the child if it is necessary, whether it be medical or psychiatric, or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.240" offset="7246335">Although the great majority of parents would act in the best interests of their minor children, the intervenors acknowledge that some may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.341" offset="7274756">The question then, is who should fill this void?</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.473" offset="7287191">Should it be the doctor or should it be the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.801" offset="7300565">The intervenors submit that is should be a Judge of the Superior Court rather than a doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.775" offset="7320418">Judges have always been resorted to, when a conflict develops over whether a parent is acting in the best interest of their child's health and well being.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.519" offset="7355422">Judges have always been resorted to, to determine whether or not a particular child is in need of a particular medical procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2012.020" offset="8153411">The statutes on their face and as they are written expressly place a medical decision in the unfettered discretion of two persons other than the patient and persons other than the physician.</text>
