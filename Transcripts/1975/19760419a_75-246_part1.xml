            <label>Mr. Robert B. Reich</label>
            <text syncTime="72.627" offset="393844">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.032" offset="407427">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.336" offset="428639">After the government’s petition was filed in this case by leave of these Courts, the claimant’s widow was substituted as respondent before this Court and for simplicity sake when I refer to the respondent I shall be referring to the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.547" offset="501468">Respondent was discharged from his position of civilian employment with the Army and Air Force Exchange Service for alleged acts of misconduct incompatible with his continued employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.249" offset="572312">That discharge was sustained on administrative appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.477" offset="593210">Respondent then commenced this suit against the United States in the Court of Claims, alleging that the discharge and the subsequent administrative appeal violated applicable Exchange Service Regulations than in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.974" offset="671160">That was also a breach of his contract of employment with the Exchange Service and that he was also thereby denied due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.889" offset="722882">He sought back pay and allowances and he asserted jurisdiction under the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.774" offset="758409">The Court of Claims denied the government’s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.643" offset="785889">The Court acknowledged that prior to 1970, it had no jurisdiction over such claims, but the Court held that the 1970 amendment to the Tucker Act which provides that a contract expressed or implied with the Exchange Service shall be deemed a contract with the United States conferred such jurisdiction and the Court reasoned that Exchange Service Employees have a contractual relationship with the Exchange Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.990" offset="939280">Now, we submit that the Court of Claims was correct only insofar as it acknowledged that it had no jurisdiction over respondent’s non-contractual claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.692" offset="994033">Congress does not appropriate money to support the Exchange Service and there is no statute or constitutional provision that can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation for the damage sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.813" offset="1058608">That is a prerequisite to jurisdiction under the Tucker Act for non-contractual claims as this Court recently acknowledged and held in United States against Testan and Zirilli (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="253.199" offset="1116077">But we submit that the Court of Claims misconstrued the 1970 Amendment to the Tucker Act to encompass within its provisions a claim by an Exchange Service employee to back pay for unlawful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.251" offset="1192355">First, such claims are not derived form contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.081" offset="1215656">The terms and conditions of employment in the Exchange Service is derived entirely from regulations, duly promulgated under the authority of the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.587" offset="1269677">Indeed the very terms and conditions that respondent alleged were violated in this case were derived solely from those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.439" offset="1309070">Now, respondent asserts in his brief before this Court that those regulations in effect constitute a contract of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.078" offset="1363613">But those regulations can be and have been unilaterally changed by the Exchange Service, by the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force as the needs of the Army and Air Force require.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.434" offset="1421083">Indeed, they were changed and modified during the Course of respondent’s employment and they continue to be subject to periodic change and modification and a long line of cases beginning with Butler against Pennsylvania, this Court has held that government employment that is based upon regulations or statutes which unilaterally must be capable of change as public needs require, does not giver rise to contractual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.728" offset="1562249">Accordingly, the Exchange Service employees like other federal employees, do not have contractual rights against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.209" offset="1612195">This conclusion --</text>

            <text syncTime="377.548" offset="1613553">There are certain inconsistencies in your argument Mr. Reich and I think there probably is in your opponent's too.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.059" offset="1639571">You have to argue that they are not government employees for one purpose and yet they are for another and he has to take just the opposite --</text>

            <text syncTime="390.077" offset="1663604">Well, we submit that the term government or Federal employees has no real talismanic significance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.198" offset="1700071">Exchange Service employees certainly are federal employees for many purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.737" offset="1718252">As we pointed out in our brief, Congress has expressly included them within the definition of federal employee for the purposes of the Dual Compensation Act and the Federal Employees Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.765" offset="1762346">They are federal employees under the Federal Tort Claims Act and many of the rules and regulations are exactly the same as those governing other federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.420" offset="1804978">The point is and I think this is the point that the Court of Claims misconstrued that the terms and conditions of employment, because they are derived entirely from regulations, duly authorized and promulgated under the authority of the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force and because they can be and must be capable of unilateral change, indeed they were capable and there were changed in this case, simply do not give rise to contractual rights, whether you term this people federal employees or something else.</text>

            <text syncTime="657.467" offset="2733161">It is not a contract because as this Court has held, well, for instance, Butler against Pennsylvania was one of the first times that this Court actually faced the issue of a government employee asserting that he had contractual rights to whatever agreement he had entered into with the government and at that time this Court said contractual rights are to be distinguished from engagements adapted by the government for the benefit of all which are to be varied or discontinued as the public good shall require and then this Court went on to say, the establishment of contract would arrest necessarily everything like progress or improvement in the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.543" offset="2901494">Now, I do not know what label it is convenient to put upon this government employment relationships, but this Court has held and we think wisely that the appellation contracts simply is inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.774" offset="2966382">Now, the legislative history of the 1970 Amendment to the Tucker Act confirms that Congress did not intend to affect the substantive rights of Exchange Service Employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.371" offset="3212769">The absence of any express reference to Exchange Service Employees in the legislative history is particularly indicative in light of the fact that there are 100,000 Exchange Service Employees and had Congress intended in 1970 to expose the Federal Treasury to the indeterminately large liabilities that might be represented by the back pay claims of this size of a group, presumably Congress would have address the issue directly but it did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.892" offset="3362921">Indeed, whenever prior to 1970, Congress had legislated with respect to the rights or obligations of Exchange Service Employees, it had done so expressly and directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.160" offset="3423943">For instance, it expressly included Exchange Service Employees within the definition of Federal Employees that I mentioned a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.217" offset="3460201">It expressly excluded Exchange Service Employees from the definition of Federal Employees for the purposes of laws administered by the Civil Service Commission, including I might add the Back Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.221" offset="3520178">Now in 1970, had Congress intended to give Exchange Service Employees a back pay remedy, presumably not only would it have addressed the issue directly in the legislation of legislative history, but presumably it would have done it directly by merely amending the Back Pay Act to encompass such claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="914.482" offset="3761236">But we would point out that in those cases Congress had waived sovereign immunity at least to the extent of creating a substantive right to money.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.013" offset="3815362">The Public Treasury was exposed by the very nature of the appropriation, but with regard to Exchange Service Employees, where Congress has not appropriated any money to support the Exchange Services that kind of logic obviously would not be sufficient to create a waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.183" offset="4416074">Three of the cases, not the Keetz case, but the other three cases involved express contracts for the supply of goods or services.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.928" offset="5039042">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.058" offset="5067568">The brief by the respondent contains three arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.129" offset="5083868">The first argument is that the respondent had a contractual relationship with the Exchange Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.677" offset="5118036">That the respondent is not within the ambit of the Butler cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.494" offset="5137262">That the record, the history of the exchange services show that the respondent and other Exchange Service Employees are contractual and not federal employees and that will be the argument I will present today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.925" offset="5199016">In my brief, however, there were two other arguments, arguments 2 and 3 in which are raised issues, the similar types of the raised by the employee and Testan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.189" offset="5248022">The Testan decision by this Court last month rejected those decisions -- those contentions and therefore my arguments 2 and 3 are now moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.383" offset="5292848">However, I would like to emphasize that the Testan case does not detract from the first argument which is a contraction argument and as I will later point out actually strengthens it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.640" offset="5349899">I also would like to mention that my arguments 2 and 3 do contain some development of the background of the Exchange Services which development is pertinent to my argument 1, and therefore, I submit respectfully that Court may wish to review arguments 2 and 3 for the purposes of the background facts, but I will not be able to cover them all in oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.419" offset="5453031">The ultimate issue here is not necessarily whether this employee and other Exchange Service Employees are in some vague way Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.802" offset="5510500">The question is whether the Butler principle should be extended to Exchange Service Employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.953" offset="5547071">Butler was decided by this Court in 1850.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.669" offset="5562013">Of course it held that the government has to be at liberty to change the agents which carry out this function whenever there has been change of policy or change administration or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.798" offset="5606526">I submit that Butler is obsolete that that is not the policy now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.917" offset="5627006">We now have stability in the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.844" offset="5646650">I am not asking the Court to renounce Butler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.616" offset="5657726">I am just asking the Court not to extend it to Exchange Service Employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.984" offset="5731287">It begins with the Constitution, Article 2 Section 2, gives the Congress the part, directs the Congress or rather gives Congress the power to delegate to the Executive the employment of Federal Employees and Congress has done that by statute Section 3101 of Title V of the U.S. Code then has done it very broadly in one sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.167" offset="5843927">Section 3101, “Each Executive Agency, Militarily Department and the Government of the District of Columbia may employ such number of employees of the various classes recognized by Chapter 51 of this Title as Congress may appropriate fore from year to year.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.842" offset="5910696">That is the delegation to the Executive to employ Federal Employees whether they are called federal employees, public officials, or inferior officers as they are refereed to in the Constitution in Article 2, Section 2 that is the delegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.720" offset="5982167">My question Mr. McGrail went to, what I thought it was (Inaudible) Congress to deal with exchange employees, way different from and separately from the Civil Service generally?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas H. McGrail</label>
            <text syncTime="1484.284" offset="6040472">Yes, and I am saying Your Honor in response to that the basic statute in which Congress does that is the one I just cited because that statute says that Federal employees are paid out of appropriated funds and Exchange Service Employees are not paid out of appropriated funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.482" offset="6133259">And Mr. Chief Justice that is confirmed in Chapter 51 which is this General Authority to employ, the Section I just quoted, cites there is another limitation and there Chapter 51 covers all civilian employees, all civilian positions employees in the Executive Branch of the government and it says this chapter does not apply to employees whose pay is not wholly from appropriated fund of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.353" offset="6264707">So there again Congress has said that federal employees are that only if they are paid by appropriated funds and the Exchange Service Employees are not paid from appropriated funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.614" offset="6341716">The Government counters this with reference to Section 2105(c) and that was the Section in which the definition of employee in Title V. Congress in that Section said that Exchange Services Employees will not be federal employees for the purpose of the Civil Service Laws and then it mentioned one or two exceptions and then as Counsel for the government has stated a moment ago, it has some in other occasions passed statutes whereby certain provisions which govern federal employees are extended to the Exchange Service Employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.345" offset="6504720">But I wish to emphasize whenever that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.993" offset="6519244">It was done expressly and explicitly by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.973" offset="6531156">It was Congress extending the anti-discrimination laws, the safety program laws or whatever may have been involved, they were not too many, it was Congress to extending those to Exchange Service Employees, it was not bringing Exchange Service Employees within the ambit of federal Employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.090" offset="6615689">So Mr. Chief Justice, I believe it is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.442" offset="6633034">Congress has always treated the Service Employees differently from federal employees, and therefore, they would not be within the Butler Concept.</text>
