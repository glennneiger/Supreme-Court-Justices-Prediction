            <text syncTime="44.408" offset="280881">My name is Michael Donahue; I am an Assistant Attorney General from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.194" offset="300107">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.982" offset="319229">The case presents a similar question to the case previously argued, it is somewhat different but it broadly presents the question of whether and to what extent procedural requirements for the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment extend to the interstate transfer of state prisoners.</text>

            <text syncTime="70.429" offset="385057">Intrastate Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.384" offset="392790">This action was originally commenced by 17 inmates confined to the Massachusetts Correctional Institute at Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.982" offset="415255">MCI-Norfolk is a medium security institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.775" offset="426435">An amended complaint was later filed by six inmates who are the respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.098" offset="447647">They sought declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to Section 1983, sought money damages against the Commissioner of Correction, the Superintendent of Norfolk alleging that hearings that had been held transferring them from Norfolk to Walpole were unconstitutional as violative of the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.227" offset="520163">The respondents asked the District Court to enjoin any transfer to Walpole and to with any of the other state institutions and it ordered -- it sought an order to the Correction Officials to place the inmates in the general population of Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.911" offset="582961">The chronology of the case is briefly as follows: In November the case was filed, the District Judge denied a temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.527" offset="609397">In January 10, 1975, following argument, the District Judge granted a preliminary injunction and ordered that the Department Officials submit regulations to deal with the question of hearings that was -- to deal with the question of hearings to be applied at MCI-Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.608" offset="673763">The regulations would have to be similar and to provide the same rights to inmates who are confined to MCI-Walpole.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.620" offset="697795">The District Judge stated part of the order, pending appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.544" offset="709498">The full panel of the First Circuit stated the remainder of the auto-pending of full argument on the merits to the full Bench of the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.838" offset="750667">In June last year the Court of Appeals reached decision affirming the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.463" offset="769162">In so doing they held that the loss suffered by inmates in transfer from Norfolk to Walpole was sufficient to constitute a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.022" offset="815346">It was a purely weight analysis; it did not reach it in the first instance by arguing whether or not there was a liberty of property interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.282" offset="844395">It said there was a cumulative approach that the loss suffered by the inmate on the transfer from Norfolk to Walpole was sufficient to invoke the procedures required by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.340" offset="884623">Judge Levin Campbell of the First Circuit dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.842" offset="894654">Judge Campbell argued that inmates had no recognizable interest in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.339" offset="912626">They had no interest in liberty of property and remaining at any particular institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.512" offset="929345">Judge Campbell said in his dissent that remaining in the Correction Institution in Massachusetts was no more than a unilateral expectation conditioned by no act of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.444" offset="969051">On December 8, 1975 this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.434" offset="985038">In the fall of 1974, the Massachusetts Correctional Institute at Norfolk was undergoing a series of significant disruptive incidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.065" offset="1011578">A series of fires occurred beginning in August, 1974 and continued through October.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.844" offset="1038641">There were nine fires.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.062" offset="1043552">They were serious enough that required the assistance of outside fire departments from the surrounding communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.853" offset="1062674">At various points, four of the surrounding towns sent firefighters in to engage in putting out the blaze.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.525" offset="1085453">From August to October over $ 100,000 in damages had occurred within the Institution, two inmate living units were burned down, there was a partial loss of the laundry at the Institution.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael C. Donahue</label>
            <text syncTime="264.832" offset="1162671">At some point in October in 1974, Superintendent of Norfolk, Mr. Larry Meachum was informed by certain inmates at the Institution that certain other inmates, among whom are the respondents here, were engaged in the disruptive incidents at the Institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.220" offset="1252218">Meachum began to take action to cause them to be removed from the general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.230" offset="1268205">On the 16th of October he removed the first of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.717" offset="1282207">By the 24th of October all of the other respondents were removed from the general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.242" offset="1304254">By October 31st there were no further fires in the Institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.904" offset="1322958">By October 25th each of the inmates had received a notice of a “discipline hearing”, notice of a discipline charge, which stated in general terms that the Superintendent of the Institution had received information through a reliable source that they were in engaged in certain general conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.520" offset="1389413">In some of the respondents’ case it was that they had engaged in setting the fires or participated in the fires.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.856" offset="1410729">In other cases it was alleged that they were trafficking in narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.099" offset="1427657">In other cases it was alleged that they were -- had possession of ammunition or weapons within the Institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.521" offset="1473423">The Local District Attorney was informed at the same time and the matter was referred to his office for investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.143" offset="1499859">Specifically because of the Massachusetts Correctional Procedures which were enforced at that time, no disciplinary hearing was held because the regulations abide holding a disciplinary hearing, abiding posing sanctions as a result of disciplinary punishment when the matter had been referred to the Local District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.307" offset="1560568">Those regulations are no longer in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.821" offset="1578540">By early November, each of the respondents received notices of “classification hearings”.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.914" offset="1602991">The classification hearings notified them in general terms of the same informant information that had been contained in the disciplinary notices and it specifically informed the inmates that they will possibly be subject to transfers to higher custody status as a result of the classification hearings which were to be scheduled.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.628" offset="1681776">Classification in Massachusetts determines custody level.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.304" offset="1692538">It does not adjudicate specific instances of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.306" offset="1704555">A Classification Board may review instances of misconduct or allegations of misconduct, only insofar as they relate to the custody level at the Institution does not determine guilt or innocence on specific disciplinary charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.504" offset="1765368">Classification hearings were scheduled and held for each one of the respondents through early November 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.602" offset="1793684">At the hearings each inmate was represented by counsel or represented by a law student.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.987" offset="1819284">Each inmate read a prepared statement by the Board as to the purpose of the hearing, the powers of the Classification Board, the possibility of the transfer could result.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.838" offset="1854602">I might add, interject at this point - the hearings were not held at the same day; they were held over one week period during or approximately one week period during November.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.821" offset="1894622">Following the statement made by the Classification Board to the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.765" offset="1910400">The inmate and the counsel were asked to leave the room for the expressed purpose of allowing the Superintendent to come in and testify as to the informant information that he possessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.087" offset="1947598">Superintendent came in the room, stated times not reflected by the record, the record does reflect, however, in the reports of the classification notices beginning at Page 68 of the Appendix that the Board examined (Inaudible) to the sources if this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.910" offset="2002977">They probe his information as to the credibility of the informants and the reliability of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.541" offset="2025443">There are specific findings in the classification reports that the Classification Board found the information to be reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.024" offset="2055431">In one instance one of the respondents was recommended by a Classification Board not to be transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.743" offset="2082285">And then on a review by the Commissioner of Correction who has the ultimate responsibility in Massachusetts, the Commissioner of Correction overruled that and order that he would be transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.810" offset="2118543">But I am moving ahead the game at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.204" offset="2136097">Following Meachum’s testimony, the inmate, he was excused, the inmate was called back into the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.330" offset="2160653">They were told that Meachum again had presented informant information.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.080" offset="2175595">In no instances it appeared that the Board summarized the information for the inmate, the position that was presented to the Court of Appeals and not to the District Court in an affidavit by Meachum was that Meachum’s judgment was that it would compromise the safety and security of the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.520" offset="2249364">There is other evidence in the record in the classification reports that the Classification Board felt that to reveal any more of the information and Meachum -- to the inmate than the general charges would have compromised the safety and the security of the informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.792" offset="2318432">The inmate was allowed to present any testimony he wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.098" offset="2327732">He was not given a compulsory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.572" offset="2333583">He was not allowed to compel the presence of Corrections Offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.250" offset="2348316">He was allowed to compel the -- he was allowed to submit documentary evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.392" offset="2360855">The record reflects that certain of the respondents’ submitted documentary evidence from individuals they worked for at the Institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.877" offset="2394814">The record reflects that certain of the respondents were allowed -- requested and were allowed and did present Corrections Offices to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.725" offset="2426161">The Board heard from the social workers in each case who testified as to the institutional history or of the respondents, they testified as to their criminal history, and the Board had a full view of what the inmates’ conduct had been in the Institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="645.542" offset="2685505">The existence of hearings in the provision for hearings is not necessarily a question which implicates the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.693" offset="2878080">The power to transfer in Massachusetts is vested in the Commissioner of Correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.298" offset="2892499">At Page 6A of the respondents’ brief, the Massachusetts statute is contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.589" offset="2913606">There were no standards implied; it just indicates that the Commissioner may transfer an inmate in his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.514" offset="2941400">So what the Board did in this instance was made a factual findings and give recommendations to the Commissioner who then proceeded to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.908" offset="2970971">Because there were no statutes or because there were no regulations which give substantive standards to the transfer of question, it is -- the petitioners’ position is that there is no legitimate claim of entitlement for an inmate to remain in the Correctional Institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.661" offset="3029903">And that any inmate’s desire to remain at that Institution is therefore conditioned by no act of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.277" offset="3052369">The desire to remain in the Institution is nothing more than a unilateral expectation.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.968" offset="3087164">The Commissioner’s decision is entirely discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.757" offset="3098344">Moreover, it is important to focus I think on the question as to what this Board did even if due process is found to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.194" offset="3132094">What this Board did was not adjudicate misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.164" offset="3144006">What the Board did was only determined the question as to the appropriateness of these inmates remaining at Norfolk in a situation which in the Superintendent’s judgment was untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.920" offset="3186951">If due process applies in the first instance we suggest this is crucial because they did not determine misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.843" offset="3214641">These inmates were not punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.184" offset="3220075">At least they were not objectively punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.816" offset="3226553">The gravity of the loss that the inmates suffered is, in our judgment, no more significant in the loss suffered by the teacher in Board of Regents versus Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.218" offset="3260199">His subjective perception may have been lost but there was nothing in an objective standard which we suggest that the Court could base the decision saying that there was a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.566" offset="3305547">These inmates were not committed to segregation at Walpole, they suffered no loss of good time, they were not branded as troublemakers as the Court of Appeals found.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.867" offset="3338775">They were, they did have notations entered in an Institutional Record but that was the only thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.527" offset="3361449">To derive injury from the mere entry to the notation is a very speculative type of approach in due process, and we think that this Court’s opinion at least recently in Paul versus Davis recognized that the stigma or unless there is an independent liberty of property interest is not a cognizable.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.909" offset="3430935">The quarrel that we have with the First Circuit’s opinion exists because the Court of Appeals decision would require us to give information which in our judgment would have revealed the identity of the informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.746" offset="3474298">That is the crux of the matter before the Court on the question of whether the process was adequate, if indeed process is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.799" offset="3506481">A summary of the evidence could have revealed the names and the identity of the informants and it was the only procedure in fact that was abbreviated by my clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.694" offset="3550053">We argued to the Court of Appeals that the procedures that were followed in the hearings were consistent with this Court’s interpretation of Wolff that when Institutional Security was implicated there were certain matters that might be excluded from the information given to the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.631" offset="3605851">Court of Appeals rejected that argument and they said that it was -- that quite frankly that the language that this Court have used was cryptic.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.957" offset="3639079">We did not find anything cryptic about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.750" offset="3646289">The language in Wolff we thought gave the Department the right to exclude summaries of evidence when, in their judgment, there would have compromise the safety and security of the informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.398" offset="3700937">The record at least says to the finding of the Classification Boards is clear on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.054" offset="3719536">There was no question in the minds of the Superintendent, there appears to have been no question in the minds of the Classification Committee that it give the inmates a summary of the evidence would have compromised their safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.435" offset="3773035">If due process is to serve in this instance, two purposes that may very well assert to accurately ascertain facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.406" offset="3800933">We contend that it was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.655" offset="3805949">There was no procedure that this Court would follow which compromise the accurate identification of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.358" offset="3836773">The procedure that the Board followed insofar as the purpose was to accurately ascertain facts was adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.154" offset="3871882">In terms of allowing the inmate to testify, to have an input in its decision, we believe that was also adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.550" offset="3897482">There is no doubt that the inmates in these cases because they were represented by counsel, because they were allowed to call witnesses, because they were allowed to present documentary evidence, had anything but a fully input into the factual considerations by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.813" offset="3966550">This may not be necessarily have been the case if we were adjudicating a specific instance of punishment, but we were not adjudicating specific instance of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.338" offset="4000613">The Board was not to determine whether or not these individuals are involved in the setting of fires.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.585" offset="4021616">The only question before the Board was the propriety of these inmates whom the Superintendent believed to have been involved, was the propriety of these inmates remaining at the Institution in Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.575" offset="4077622">This case, we suggest, really presents the question of where balance ought to be struck in prison situations, the balance that was noted in Wolff versus McDonnell between the need for institutional security and the right to protect individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.635" offset="4125792">In this instance we believe what Judge Campbell in his dissenting opinion that the States interest is paramount, the States interest is so important in instances of this nature, that the court should properly strike the balance in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.470" offset="4185142">We are not trying to limit the right to hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.632" offset="4193815">In Massachusetts, hearings are held for virtually every conceivable administrative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.902" offset="4214922">Prior to this Court’s opinion in Wolff versus McDonnell the record reflects that Massachusetts had promulgated disciplinary procedures which granted procedures in excess of what this Court constitutionally mandated in Wolff versus McDonnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.387" offset="4268839">Classification Regulations in its full sense were issued later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.499" offset="4285348">Every procedure dealing with transfer, every procedure dealing with discipline is covered under Massachusetts Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.336" offset="4312620">There are no standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.112" offset="4315755">We do not think that they create an entitlement by that, by the existence of the Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.835" offset="4334667">But the procedures in Massachusetts -- the Massachusetts prison system was followed to allow a hearing in virtually every conceivable limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.484" offset="4361208">So that is not really the question before the Court, the question is not an effort on the part of the Government to limit the right of hearings and to taking unilateral and arbitrary action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.621" offset="6325825">I will address only the question whether the transfer of prisoner to a prison with a higher security classification implicates the procedural protections of due process and it is the position of the United States that such a transfer does not implicate due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.733" offset="6394266">By its terms the Due Process Clause applies only where governmental actions threaten to deprive an individual of life, liberty and property. In a case such as this, therefore, analysis necessarily begins with an inquiry into whether the substantive interest is at stake, the substantive interest underlying the claim or subsumed under either liberty or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.881" offset="6494785">As this Court stated in Board of Regents against Roth, to determine whether due process requirements apply in the fist place, we must look not to the weight but to the nature of the interest at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.207" offset="6544104">Court of Appeals bypassed this necessary inquiry into the nature of the effected interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.775" offset="6566360">It formulated the issue solely in terms of the weight of those interests by asking whether the detriment worked by the challenge transfer was serious enough to trigger the application of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.667" offset="6625920">The detriment alone without more is not sufficient to implicate due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.390" offset="6680881">The interest and reputation in Paul against Davis or the interest in continued employment in Roth was not sufficient to implicate due process because those affected interest were neither liberty nor property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.507" offset="6757368">We believe that it is important that the Roth analysis be adhered to requirement that a liberty or a property interest be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.655" offset="6789969">A requirement that is imposed by the Constitution itself is an appropriate and wise limitation on the applicability of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.478" offset="6825182">A contrary rule which threatened to hamstring the Government, hamstring the essential operations of Government by requiring a hearing or other due process procedure and virtually every term.</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.781" offset="6966452">As we note I think that in the Footnote 15 of Page 22 of our brief, there may be an issue of whether the conditions of solitary confinement are so different from those of other confinements as to possibly implicate a constitutional liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.178" offset="7031967">We would say that in answer to your question there would be no liberty interest of non-constitutional origin.</text>

            <text syncTime="2534.493" offset="10241266">First of all, the close relationship of this case to Wolff versus McDonnell is indicated by the fact that a disciplinary process was initiated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.042" offset="10287451">This demonstrates that there was a recognition on the part of prison officials that there were historical facts at controversy and that there was a violation of a regulation at stake.</text>

            <text syncTime="3975.773" offset="16006386">In summary with respect to the interest implicated the prisoners maintained that there is a liberty interest which flows because from the Constitution which resulted from the external bodily restraints upon the prisoner’s and the closer custody and conditions of confinement that secondarily within Massachusetts, because of a deliberate differentiation of conditions of confinement, because of the graduated conditions of confinement there is a liberty interest in effect State created as in Wolff and very similar to the creation of good time credits in Wolff, which is implicated by the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.781" offset="16158419">And as we have argued in our there is also a property interest which is implicated in this case and because of the particular statutes and administrative regulations in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.715" offset="16218187">There are two points that deserve emphasis Your Honor in conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.229" offset="16232189">One is that a hearing in these circumstances is necessary to insure that there is a reliable determination of the disputed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.875" offset="16274821">Minimal due process procedures in this case will not impinge at all on the appropriate good faith exercise of administrative discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.493" offset="16309302">Once the facts have been reliably found, then the Correctional Officials will be free to exercise their discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.375" offset="16344829">In the case where allegations of serious misconduct are at issue, this Court has already recognized that the need for minimal due process procedures is evident, and that in similar situations when transfer results in the same deprivations the need is no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.813" offset="16442527">The Prison Officials in addition concede in their argument that Prison Officials have no interest enacting arbitrary and capriciously.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.173" offset="16475964">And a hearing in these circumstances would insure that their discretion is exercised appropriately and on the basis of facts reliably found.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.884" offset="16526850">The petitioner -- the prisoner’s claim, pardon me Your Honors, is grounded in considerations already have reflected in Wolff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.404" offset="16560914">Prisoners do retain a residuum of liberty, a limited liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.515" offset="16577319">When this is interfered with, the Due Process Clause is implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.310" offset="16592574">When allegations of misconduct are at issue minimal due process procedures are necessary to insure a reliable determination of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.073" offset="16623608">Other circumstances not presented by allegations of misconduct and not presented in the instant case, other transfer circumstances where liberty interests are implicated may be left to the sound discretion of Prison Officials to forge appropriate procedures based on the individual circumstances so long as these procedures insure that the lofty purposes of the Due Process Clause are maintained in the prisons of this Country.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael C. Donahue</label>
            <text syncTime="4161.166" offset="16747951">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.133" offset="16755787">Just two brief points. The possibility of a transfer occurring for disciplinary measures is somewhat ambiguous in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.731" offset="16794240">The sanctions that may be imposed by the Disciplinary Regulations which appear in this record include transfer as a possible sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.639" offset="16829871">That is not the practice in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.122" offset="16835826">First of all, because those regulations are no longer in effect and second of all it was never the practice of the Disciplinary Board to transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.745" offset="16862262">It only recommended transfer as to the Classification Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.850" offset="16874697">I would like to address the point that Mr. Shapiro raised concerning the inmate’s interest in remaining in the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.915" offset="16903013">As Mr. Jones pointed out, all of these inmates in this instance were sentenced to MCI-Walpole prior to being transferred for whatever reason to MCI-Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.277" offset="16948362">No reason apparent in the record why any of these inmates were sent to Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.404" offset="16964871">Transfers occur in Massachusetts for a myriad of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.592" offset="16977619">They may occur because of population control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.924" offset="16987023">They may occur simply because of program availability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.592" offset="16997681">They may -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4225.250" offset="17004264">For certain matters in Massachusetts they may occur because of the hospital at Norfolk is regarded as significantly better than the hospital in Walpole.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.212" offset="17032163">Inmates who have medical problems may be sent to Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.028" offset="17043448">It does not depend on the behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.935" offset="17051075">It is not predicated upon their behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.129" offset="17059853">There may be general instances where an inmate will be transferred to Norfolk for behavior, but there is no indication in record of this case that any of these inmates were sent to Norfolk because they were better behaved than other inmates who remained at Walpole.</text>

            <text syncTime="4267.608" offset="17173746">I do not think such statistics are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.537" offset="17181479">And in anyway, in any event I think it will be significantly less because there are approximately 2,700 inmates in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.451" offset="17209064">The Institutions at Norfolk and Walpole are only approximately one mile part so there would not probably be any significant disruption of the administrative process, and we do not contend that that would be the case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4317.808" offset="17374576">The District Court -- the District Court’s rulings include a reference to the defendants asserting that to give such notice would have compromised the safety of the informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4326.393" offset="17408849">It was my client’s position that any further notice, any further detail would have seriously compromised the safety of the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.274" offset="17440404">As the Chief Justice pointed out in earlier in a question, in Norfolk which is an open institution where inmates roam generally at will there would have been a great deal of probability that giving the time and place of the offense that they were charging, the informant could have been identified.</text>
