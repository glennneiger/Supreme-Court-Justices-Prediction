            <text syncTime="16.482" offset="139491">In the first of these two cases I might say preliminary that Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of either of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.012" offset="189646">In the first De Canas v. Bica, which is here from an Intermediate Appellate Court of Appeal in California, section 2805 (a) of the California Labor Code prohibits a California employer from knowingly employing an alien who was not entitled the lawful residence in the United States if the aliens employment would have an adverse effect on lawful California resident workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.548" offset="315765">Our opinion on file with the clerk reverses the holding of the California courts that that statute is unconstitutional, either as an impermissible regulation of immigration, a subject exclusively reserved to the Congress for regulation, or as being preempted under the Supremacy Clause by the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
