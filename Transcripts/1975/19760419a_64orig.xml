            <text syncTime="16.754" offset="170343">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.301" offset="184554">This is a dispute between the States of Maine and New Hampshire over the location of their lateral marine boundary in the Piscataqua River and Gosport Harbor in the intervening marine area.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.120" offset="227812">The legal issue in this case is the proper interpretation of the 1740 boundary decree of the King of England, which describes the boundary in these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.238" offset="268250">Maine’s original interpretation of the decree was an extended thalweg line in Piscataqua Harbor and Gosport Harbor intersecting and intervening marine area.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.674" offset="314016">New Hampshire's original line is a light sun range line connecting four-point to Whaleback light.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.506" offset="341288">It was Maine’s enforcement of its lobster regulations in the intervening marine area between these two lines, which led to regulatory conflict and an attempt to resolve the boundary through boundary commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.042" offset="395518">This attempt failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.940" offset="407117">Subsequent enforcement action led to conflict between enforcement officers of both States and an Executive Moratorium on enforcement to permit New Hampshire to file its complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.997" offset="455287">New Hampshire filed that complaint on June 6, 1973 and a Master, Justice Thomas Clark was appointed on November 5, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.605" offset="493739">Soon after his appointment, Justice Clark met with counsel for Maine and New Hampshire to urge the States to settle this dispute and to avoid long and disruptive litigation with great expense to the people of both States.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.829" offset="546611">Counsel accepted his recommendation and met to review principles of law, which would determine the location of the boundary and the proper interpretation of the description of 174 decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.884" offset="590810">They were able to reach agreement on this and filed a joint motion for consent decree on September 23, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.026" offset="627381">In February 27, 1975 the stipulated record in support of that joint motion for consent was submitted to the Special Master and the case was finally submitted without oral argument on March 17, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.411" offset="688926">After reviewing the stipulated record and the consent decree submitted by the States, the Special Master decided that he had to reject the consent decree, because he believed that the Court was without jurisdiction to enter and also, because he felt the geographic middle rather than thalweg was the proper interpretation of the word “middle” in the boundary description.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.386" offset="788818">State of Maine has taken exceptions to both of these determinations, but before discussing our exceptions, I would like to describe to the Court the substantial prejudice, which Special Master’s rejection of the consent decree, adoption of the geographic middle line and also, his failure to hear full argumentations on the issues below has caused to the interest to the State of Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.555" offset="889546">First of course, we have lost to the State of New Hampshire by the Master’s description of a new line.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.899" offset="910862">Over 636 acres of land in the intervening marine area, land which is in dispute between New Hampshire and Maine fishermen, and presents a great emotional issue in both states.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.859" offset="1122767">As much objection as we have for the lost of the 636 acres, we feel that we have been much more greatly prejudiced by the Master’s adoption of an equidistant boundary in the Piscataqua River.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.959" offset="1171146">The Master, at page 43 of his report, it indicated that it would not be necessary for purposes of this dispute to delimit that boundary, but because we are going to have to live with it, we have asked the state department, the Office of the Geographer to do a rough approximation of what an equidistant line would look like and they have done it on a map that refers also to the thalweg, which we have just distributed just prior to the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.379" offset="1272815">As you can see, it is an extremely irregular line, which will be very, very difficult to mark on the water and will give rise to great opportunities for the kinds of jurisdiction and regulatory conflicts, which gave rise to dispute in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1033.589" offset="4237713">The point that we are making in this case is that every indication in the boundary proceedings was the thalweg was meant when the term middle was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.707" offset="4270105">The Special Master has referred to some of the evidence we referred to in our brief with regard to the use of channel in the Merrimack River and also, with regard to deeds relied on by Massachusetts, which referred to the Channel of Piscataqua.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.535" offset="4333425">There are two indications though that were not cited on the brief or referred to by the Special Master, which we think are a strong indication that the term “channel” was meant,-- channel was meant when the term “middle“ was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.481" offset="4393194">The first of these is the Charter of King Charles II to Rhode Island in 1664 was issued just before the charter that he issued to New Hampshire in 1679.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.277" offset="4468426">That charter is described in Rhode Island, Massachusetts at 37 United States 464.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.665" offset="4493922">And, in that charter, the King Charles, the persons, who issued one of the boundary determinations that was in the line of title, the boundary commissioners were determining indicated that the definition of “middle” was “channel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.778" offset="4554421">Thus, when he has describing the location of the boundary between Connecticut and Rhode Island to the South, he indicated that it went to the middle or to the channel of a river there commonly called and known by the name of Pawcatuck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.663" offset="4613981">We think is a contemporaneous indication that thalweg was in vogue and being used at the time the decree was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.334" offset="4648671">The Master has seized upon the use of the word “the half” in the New Hampshire's petition for appeal is apparently the strongest basis for adopting geographic middle and we found a passage in Bellmap, history of New Hampshire, which indicates how insignificant the use of the “half” is in the description of that boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.008" offset="4743339">Thus, it is clear that the State of New Hampshire in authorizing the appeal did not use the word the “half”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.391" offset="4772909">The only time it was used is by the solicitor for the State of New Hampshire plus someone who had been hired and was in England filing papers before the King’s counsel and a petition for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.785" offset="4822438">The passage in Bellmap, which is very, very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.074" offset="4835603">I would just like to read, because it describes the relationship between this solicitor in England and New Hampshire's actual intentions and he says, “They obliged us to make bricks without straw, above all why did not they send a copy of their own appeal, for want of it, I have been forced to guess what that appeal was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.006" offset="4927345">From loose passages in Mr. A’s letters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.773" offset="4938421">So the solicitor, who use the word “the half,” had to guess what New Hampshire is doing back in the colonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.920" offset="4966947">He did not have any direct information, New Hampshire when he used the word “half.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.624" offset="4981785">We believe that strongly this undercuts the Master’s strong reliance on the use of the word “half” to determine geographic middle.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.102" offset="5063705">Finally, I like to also note that this use of the word “half” was in the petition for appeal was the second time the New Hampshire used that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.445" offset="5101112">The first time they used it, they used it with regard to navigational criteria and not criteria based on geometric concepts, such as geographic middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.810" offset="5134549">Thus, in the boundary proceedings, they indicated that the half of the Isle of Shoals was divided by the Harbor of Rhode, which lay between.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.740" offset="5178225">Now, this is a clear reference to navigational use of the area and it is consistent with the use of thalweg or channel in the other portion of the northern boundary and not with the Master’s adoption of a geometric concept to determine the meaning of the word middle.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard Upton</label>
            <text syncTime="1693.764" offset="6878379">Your honor, One of the tests they use is that proposed by Mr. Badge, a former geographer of the State Department to draw a parallel lines at the end of each off shore formation to the shore and if the amount of water area between the island or off shore formation and the shore is greater than the off shore formation, then it cannot be assimilated to the shore and used as a point of reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.670" offset="6977958">Now, in this situation, this is obviously too small and too far to move from the shore to qualify in to that task.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.276" offset="7004394">And, I understand that approach is almost a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.981" offset="7043264">Both parties are having their briefs gone farther than to argue, merely the point of whether the measurement should be made from these off shore formations, whether they are properly part of the bank or the river, which one should measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.872" offset="7090807">And, we have gone into the analogy of various articles of the Geneva Convention of the territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.687" offset="7118078">Now, we have may complicate matters by doing this, but we feel obliged to go into it, because the Master did and he used it to justify what he had done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.442" offset="7165099">I think it all stems from Article 12 of the Geneva Convention of 1958, which states that the territorial sea outside of internal waters should be divided between States, whose coastlines are adjacent by Median Line Principle, measured from the nearest points on each State’s base line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.777" offset="7258408">The Masters apparently applied this analogy to internal waters, because we are here in internal waters, inside the closing line of the harbor, whether one looks at it by Maine's standpoint or by New Hampshire’s standpoint, but I urge to the Court that if we ought to apply this analogy of international law to internal waters, it ought to be done with extreme care and with an eye to the real purposes of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.320" offset="7364570">To do it, we have to consider Maine and New Hampshire as foreign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.975" offset="7383169">Having opposing coastlines on each side of the river, but this is a very narrow river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.693" offset="7406052">It is a little over a mile-and-a-half wide at the mouth and it narrows down as we go further inland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.289" offset="7432488">Now, how would coastal baselines be drawn on each side of the river from which to measure the median line or boundary?</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.707" offset="7466134">Now, we say that if this analogy is to be followed at all, Article 3 should be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.675" offset="7490062">That is the normal baseline follows the low water line on the Maine land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.288" offset="7516498">That islands should only be considered part of the shore if they qualify under the tests of the United States versus Louisiana, that is their size and closeness, makes them really an integral part of the Maine land and that the use of low tide elevations that is rocks exposed only at low tide as part of the baseline is optional under International Law and to use these as measuring points in such close waters is apt to create distortion and unequal division waters of the river and that is just what it would do if this happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.417" offset="7648991">I think it is demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.563" offset="7657559">At the very least, a low tide elevation should not have more influence than an island, but if the Master is correct, he would be giving it that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.396" offset="7696847">And, we say that was his principle error, otherwise we have no objection with his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.706" offset="7726105">Now, Maine is referred to Article 4 of the Convention, which is an optional method of drawing long straight baselines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.326" offset="7764661">It is optional not mandatory and it was fathered by the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Anglo-Norwegian Fisheries Case in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.476" offset="7809174">It is optional; it applies to the peculiar coastline that was found of Norway with many deeply intended fiords.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.549" offset="7841461">It is not appropriate to apply by analogy to closely bounded internal waters and the decision was never accepted by the United States government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.879" offset="7886810">In fact, a law was advocated by California, it was not followed in United States versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.670" offset="7917948">And, to use this method and to use Whaleback Reef would cause much more than a 15 percent departure from the general direction of the Maine shore, which was the maximum thought permissible in the Anglo-Norwegian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.761" offset="7978343">Now, turning to the point that occupied the Court’s attention, when Maine was arguing, the rejection of the motion for entry of judgment by consent, was the master correct in rejecting it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.976" offset="8039261">And, is New Hampshire's present position in support of the Master correct?</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.432" offset="8057024">We believe the Master gave sound and adequate reasons for recommending rejection of the consent decree and we have not taken any exception to this ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.328" offset="8100596">The motion for entry of judgment, by consent, and I took part in it, was an effort by the two States to get a comprised settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.617" offset="8137794">Frankly, a compromised settlement approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.667" offset="8150020">It had to become a judgment of this Court or it would do us no good, because our State had already unilaterally adopted a boundary line in consistent with anything Maine would agree to and our legislature had provided that this shall be the line governing all public offices of New Hampshire unless and until modified by a compact or by judgment of the United States Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2232.890" offset="9034839">Now, we compromised in these ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.527" offset="9045393">The thalweg versus the geographical middle, New Hampshire accepted the thalweg and then we further compromised on thalweg by deciding we would agree, it was a straight line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.246" offset="9096279">When in fact of course, it cannot be physically, but for convenience of law enforcement, we agreed that it was the thalweg and that was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.293" offset="9144449">Secondly, the mouth of the harbor for determining the point, where the thalweg ended, we agreed was a line going from Odion’s point to a submerged rock called, Kitsch rock, which has a whistling boy on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.339" offset="9200665">This again, was an arbitrary compromise administrative convenience, but it has no relation to law that applies to tell where the harbor’s mouth is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.364" offset="9248730">And finally, we agreed that the line across the open sea would be a straight line, rather than a curved line, as sought by Maine, based on the United States geological survey maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.224" offset="9296168">And here, the Master has found that we adopted correct law, the straight line is proper under the special circumstances exception of the Geneva Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.147" offset="9343920">Now, when the terms of this settlement were proposed to the Master, he told us now he now doubted that he had the power to accept it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.967" offset="9479130">On the record we made far, because when we knew about Vermont versus New York we tried to repair the situation by presenting the Master with a stipulation for an evidentiary record, which is reported in full on pages 2 and 3 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.016" offset="9543391">So, he would have something by which to judge the lawfulness and reasonableness of the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.093" offset="9571708">Now, he recommended rejection, he thought we were presenting him with a fait accompli which he would merely rubber stamp and which did not call for the exercise of the judicial power, that is applying established principles of law to facts, which either have been stipulated to or settled by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.552" offset="9653523">He felt that this was not kind of a thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2662.709" offset="10754114">We had Vermont versus New York, we had the stipulated record, we have the Master moving be rejected and we had detailed findings by him that it was the geographic middle rather than the thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.525" offset="10801448">And, we support that ruling, because in reviewing the record of the boundary Commissioners, we find that when they referred to the Merrimack River on the south they always used the words “Middle of the Channel,” or as when they refer to the Piscataqua River on the north they used “Middle of the River,” and New Hampshire Commissioners talked about losing half the river to Maine, then Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Commissioner said that the line was always been in the middle of the river, because those islands nearest to each state have always been taxed by each state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.664" offset="10938016">And, we say that language speaks in terms of geographic middle just as in the case of Texas versus Louisiana, where Your Honors felt that the intent of Congress was directed to the middle of the river, geographic middle rather than the thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.991" offset="11011264">And, we feel this case is equally as strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.867" offset="11026833">Thalweg was not in vogue, as a tool of interpretation in 1740.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.881" offset="11050865">Also, we went then under British Colonial rule, where there was freedom of navigation to all British subjects, including colonists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.766" offset="11082421">There was obstruction freedom of navigation, which is one of the things that makes thalweg applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.580" offset="11113664">I have not touched on the lights on range argument of the Amicus Curiae because there is no exception before the Court raising that question, but if the Court is interested in considering it, there is an apt quotation in United States versus Louisiana 394 US at page 76.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.738" offset="11206242">“The unauthorized acts of private citizens could generally not support a claim of historic title.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.501" offset="11237275">And so in conclusion, we submit the Master’s report should be confirmed with the exception that the Court should hold it was error to use these low tide elevations.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Bradley</label>
            <text syncTime="2886.809" offset="11650532">I would like to refer briefly to the questions that were raised with respect to whether a factual determination is required in determining whether these low tide elevations, the Special Master used qualified for the test under the Geneva Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.003" offset="11735274">The arguments that my brother Upton has made are that this is not an island, a low tide elevation within the meaning of island part of the Maine land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.347" offset="11776652">These kinds of questions have given rise to substantial evidentiary hearings in cases in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.784" offset="11806431">An opportunity which the State of Maine or the State of New Hampshire had, because of the way this came up to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.928" offset="11843003">This is a problem in another regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.117" offset="11855750">The Special Master, we believe has seriously prejudiced a right of the State of Maine that exists outside the issues in this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.974" offset="11891172">Thus, the Master found it was essential to determine where the location of inland waters was, because he felt this Court in US may determine that there was no ownership in the intervening area between Gosport Harbor and Piscataqua.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.153" offset="11951881">But, we believe that this is inconsistent with the reservation of jurisdiction, which this Court has exercised at 421 US 958 in granting the motion of the United States government to reserve its jurisdiction to determine questions just to this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.516" offset="12021367">State of Maine has an historic inland water claim and other coastline claims, which would give its sovereignty over the area between Piscatqua Harbor and Gosport Harbor and we believe that we should have the opportunity to be permitted to apply the criteria that the Courts announced in dealing with similar claims States of Alaska, Florida and Louisiana in just last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.049" offset="12107466">The Master’s determination has precluded us from doing that and we do not even know he was doing it, until a report came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.296" offset="12132544">We did not in choosing thalweg, in choosing straight line portion of the boundary think that we needed to determine the extent of inland waters, which is why the questions, which the Master has focused so strongly on, with respect to the locations of inland water and geographic middle are almost irrelevant to the determinations that went in to the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.003" offset="12219375">All we needed to do was to decide thalweg was appropriate in the river in the Harbor and then determine where the line ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.818" offset="12250617">That did not need any great application of legal principles, because it was a factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.156" offset="12271933">The channel gradually disappeared as it hit the open ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.216" offset="12284158">We did not need to determine the mouth of the river and I submit that we did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.511" offset="12297324">All we did was determine a reasonable place for the thalweg to end without having any requirement for determining inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.823" offset="12330656">We believe we have been prejudiced by the determination of the Master and that if you are going to use a concept of inland waters that we ought to have our opportunity in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.341" offset="12364720">These boundaries are very serious things to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.112" offset="12375796">We are going to have to live with them for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.332" offset="12384678">We believe we deserved the opportunity to have a full determination of our facts and evidence before the Courts merely accepts the report of the Special Master.</text>
