            <text syncTime="53.599" offset="317684">Mr. Lord, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry R. Lord</label>
            <text syncTime="56.204" offset="328133">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.873" offset="342866">The plaintiff here of Virginia Corporation has attacked successfully up until this moment before a Three-Judge Court on Equal Protection and Commerce Clause grounds, a sub part of a single aspect of Maryland’s enlightened and comprehensive program unique in the nation for removing from the highways and junkyards of the State blighted automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.408" offset="460939">The operative facts here although somewhat dreary and inelegant are nonetheless quite important to a full understanding of the program and of the constitutional claims at least in our view are relatively simple despite the fact that the appellee here has filed a 40-page statement of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.382" offset="548815">I would like to take 5 minutes to touch on those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.453" offset="581102">This program originated as a result of careful study made in 1967 by the Legislative Council of Maryland of the very problem that I have described a minute ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.296" offset="632511">The counsel report is in the record and I think a reading of it will indicate the attention that was giving to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.116" offset="679741">The counsel recognized that hulks accumulated on the lots of automobile wreckers throughout the State, largely because the free market mechanism at that time provided very little financial incentive to wreckers to place these vehicles in the hands of scrap processors for recycling.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.470" offset="765213">Accordingly, a three-part program with both carrot and stick aspects was adopted in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.744" offset="806278">Part one, required all wreckers to be licensed and it limited the wreckers in the way that they maintain their yards.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.537" offset="849432">There were density requirements and stacking requirements as to heights of vehicles so that inspection could be done more readily and also -- so that the blight would not be as obvious from the roads.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="198.249" stopTime="211.043">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="198.249" offset="896348">Mr. Lord, it might help some, as if you could raise the microphone a little bit in the event that—</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_r_lord" startTime="211.043" stopTime="297.174">
            <label>Mr. Henry R. Lord</label>
            <text syncTime="211.043" offset="947444">Now, out-of-state processors were also licensed for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.827" offset="970640">In fact, in the 1969 statute provided that wreckers had to be resident in the State of Maryland to be licensed but processors such as the plaintiff could be licensed no matter where they operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.311" offset="1032603">It being recognized that an out-of-state processor could contribute just as well to solving the environmental problem of Maryland by removing this hulks from the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.696" offset="1074085">Now, as far as an out-of-state processor is concerned, the licensing requirements were and are identical, same fee, they must have the same sort of equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.496" offset="1117344">The equipment, I think was described in an article which is in the record but very quickly a processors equipment must include a hydraulic bailer which is known in the trade as a gold finger machine, reduces an automobile to a 2 x 2 x 5 foot bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.070" offset="1195607">Or a shredder or what is known as sheers, that plus payment of the fee plus maintaining of at least a nominal office in the State, although records do not have to be kept there and compliance with other rather rudimentary Maryland regulations admit an out-of-state processor to the Maryland program.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="297.174" offset="1292051">I think the wrecker who must be a resident and a processor who may or may not be a resident, is that it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry R. Lord</label>
            <text syncTime="302.478" offset="1313262">That is correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="303.212" stopTime="305.273">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="303.212" offset="1316188">And what does the wrecker do that a processor does it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_r_lord" startTime="305.273" stopTime="424.874">
            <label>Mr. Henry R. Lord</label>
            <text syncTime="305.273" offset="1324443">Well, a wrecker, your Honor is a person who takes possession of hulks of automobiles, holds them for resale for the value of all the wreck or of the parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.216" offset="1380136">And I think it is fair to say that a wrecker is very often the source of hulks to clients such as my Brother represents here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.526" offset="1433426">The processor, they are the source to the processor, one of several.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.365" offset="1452756">I suppose that is the next Equal Protection case we will have to defend is one based on that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.080" offset="1475639">But that distinction does not have to be before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.268" offset="1484417">We have already had one Equal Protection challenge and I will come to that in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.015" offset="1503434">Suffice it to say that Alexandria qualified and was licensed – so that is one part of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.631" offset="1529870">Part two is the stick aspect and that is that there is a continuing fine assessed against a wrecker who maintains in his possession for more than a six months – for more than a one year period of vehicle more than ten years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.665" offset="1605938">So it becomes economically a liability to him to keep it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.470" offset="1621194">It is encouraging him to move it off to a processor.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.733" offset="1634255">And so it is really encouraging commerce at least in this aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.047" offset="1647525">Now the third facet is the carrot, the carrot is the bounty, the bounty is payable if a licensed wrecker is involved, half to the licensed wrecker delivering the hulk, half to the processor.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.955" offset="1699143">In the event that there is no licensed wrecker, if some other source has brought the vehicle abandoned in Maryland to the processor, the entire $16 which is the current total, although it is varied over the years is paid to the processor.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.404" offset="1768942">It is an extra bonus in effect for ridding Maryland of another hulk vehicle.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="424.874" offset="1802797">I take it that Maryland policy is directed not merely to getting the hulks off the highway right away but to getting them even off the wrecker’s private property because of --.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_r_lord" startTime="434.617" stopTime="520.643">
            <label>Mr. Henry R. Lord</label>
            <text syncTime="434.617" offset="1841772">Exactly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.847" offset="1846683">I would say there is an equal interest in both.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.721" offset="1858177">But the program, although the statute could be clear on this is restricted to hulks that have been abandoned in Maryland -- any fair reading in the statute I think will indicate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.055" offset="1907496">And their definitions in the statute which I think support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.801" offset="1926513">Now, that is the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.870" offset="1938843">Now what has happened under the program is that in the five years of its existence, simple mathematics applied to the dollar figures in the records would indicate that at least a hundred thousand vehicles have been removed from the junkyards, to use Justice Rehnquist’s question, and the highways of the State, abandoned cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.378" offset="2032884">Now, who knows how many would have been removed if there had not been a bounty program but it is fair to say that a very high percentage of those are the result of the inducements already described.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.898" offset="2078964">Now, the record further shows that Alexandria has participated in this program from its inception and has received an excess of $219,000.00 of money from Maryland’s Treasury under the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.308" offset="2140508">Money, of course could not have received without the program it might have received the hulks and it might have received just as many of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.655" offset="2169974">But it would not have received the bounty because it was not in existence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="520.643" stopTime="521.799">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="520.643" offset="2185857">That is all bounty, is it not?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="522.283" offset="2192439">Either the half shared with the wrecker or the whole?</text>

          <turn speaker="henry_r_lord" startTime="525.648" stopTime="672.908">
            <label>Mr. Henry R. Lord</label>
            <text syncTime="525.648" offset="2205919">Precisely, your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.836" offset="2214696">Now, as with any new and innovative program, the General Assembly since its inception has constantly monitored this program in the light of experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.300" offset="2256492">And a review of the Maryland Acts for the last several years will indicate that there have been at least a dozen amendments probably as many as a dozen-and-a-half to this program, different parts of it is. It is a complicated lengthy piece of statutory material.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.747" offset="2314275">One of these Amendments, Chapter 465 of the Laws of Maryland of 1974 is the subject of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.948" offset="2355130">Now, the challenged Amendment does not relate in any way to the three-part program described.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.091" offset="2375715">It does not even relate to the entire bounty program.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.761" offset="2390343">It relates to the manner by which vehicles in a certain category and bear in mind that this bounty is available on all abandoned vehicles no matter whether it was an Aston Martin that just rolled off the assembly lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.776" offset="2438408">But the one category that is being complained about is an eight-year-old and inoperable vehicle which prior to the 74 Amendment for out-of-state processors could be received and a bounty paid thereon by virtue of something known as an indemnity agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.740" offset="2514268">An agreement between the person delivering the vehicle to the processor and the processor himself executed of course at the door of the processors plant upon the delivery of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.902" offset="2570902">In effect holding harmless, the processor for any claims by prior person entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.590" offset="2601726">That is really what this case comes down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.382" offset="2616877">Now, prior to that amendment -- we will come to this in a more clearly in the Equal Protection discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.563" offset="2657524">Prior to that amendment, vehicles in that category could really be destroyed without any Due Process notions that traditionally have been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.215" offset="2700155">The notice, the publication, all of which is carefully written into the first part of the statute was absent in this last part and if the Court would like to direct its attention to the statute, it is found in 17A in the appendix in 18A – I am sorry, 15A and 16A.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.192" offset="2792106">Now—</text>

            <text syncTime="694.649" offset="2881968">All of the prior language which overflows to 15A and 16A says in essence only this, anybody who is licensed, unlicensed, resident or non-resident who comes into the possession of a vehicle, eight years old and inoperable can transfer that into the bounty program through a processor without the title and without notification procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.611" offset="2997742">It is open-ended and really threatened to swallow up all of the carefully drafted aspects of the statute which are laid out at the prior ten or 15 pages of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.480" offset="4441269">Indemnity agreements was the first, a second was a Wrecker’s Certificate, which is a document obtained from Motor Vehicle Administration after the wrecker has established a Motor Vehicle Administration that he has evidence of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.108" offset="4495708">That becomes a titled document and that is the second way and a typical way that a wrecker passed its title to a processor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1181.010" offset="4827359">Maryland wanted to do several things with this Amendment in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.877" offset="4842823">First of all, it wanted to legitimize a haphazard practice with respect to indemnity agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.795" offset="4866542">It wanted to announce the principle that at least in Maryland, indemnity agreements were valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.443" offset="4889112">Your Honors know that there is a split of authority around the country on whether indemnity agreements are valid, public policy documents, they are for these purposes in Maryland.</text>

            <text syncTime="1213.669" offset="4957971">That is why it is restricted to indemnity agreements in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.303" offset="4972495">Now, it is interesting too that there are five other out-of-state processors who have gained the benefits over the years of the Maryland program but only one, Alexandria has brought this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.817" offset="5030591">Now, the reason is, the other processors have just shifted their ground and it have obtained vehicles more readily under the Wrecker’s Certificate and had it relied on indemnity agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.127" offset="5247826">But the record also shows that the money figures are unpersuasive and may help the State, there is no loss of revenue established, further establishes however, and equally, importantly that there other sources of vehicles and in fact those sources picked up after in Alexandria’s case after the 74 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.601" offset="5337687">The second justification and under the McGowan, Dandridge, and San Antonio School District cases, these justifications are clearly satisfactory are that owners gain additional protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.522" offset="13381416">In the first of them you would be further away but you might be subjects to attacks such as in the Hood case and in the Seeling case where you had the retention for own use within own State to the disadvantage of one of the Sister States who seek to serve its market out of your available resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.684" offset="13570020">I will submit that upon examination of the record you will not find evidence that Alexandria was paid for any units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.398" offset="13600949">It was improper to pay it for, these again revert to the substance of Mr. Lord’s argument that if you pick a car up out of Maryland that you need must restrict the right to receive bounty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.663" offset="13653925">Now, for the Courts benefit in the record although not printed in your appendix at pages, record pages 261 through 266 the Court will find specimens of indemnity agreements which were agreed to be the forms which were and had been in use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.513" offset="13749324">Upon checking those indemnity agreements accepted by the State of Maryland, you will note that Alexandria Scrap was the only one whose indemnity agreement showed where the vehicle was picked up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.599" offset="13805749">All other indemnity agreements simply showed the license number, the make and the model.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.882" offset="13826856">There was nothing, no question raised as respect where these vehicles had been abandoned in order to accept indemnity agreements from various persons who had participated in the program.</text>

            <text syncTime="3458.367" offset="13936779">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.441" offset="13941063">I would like to pick up a point raised by Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Stevens relating to the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.930" offset="13975022">The State’s position is that this case stands alone because, first of all, it does not relate to a milk industry as all the other cases seem to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.119" offset="14023819">But secondly because this is a subsidy program established by the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.443" offset="14053076">And the argument presented here, I think is unique in this Court, namely that a subsidy program established by the State that has yielded enormous sums of money no matter how split up that money has been at the whim of the plaintiff in this case and now acclaims that its receiving less than it was receiving before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.647" offset="14157879">You have to look at this 1974 Amendment as part and parcel of the 1969 Legislation and indeed all the amendments to that legislation and treated as if everything passed at one time and then apply the test under Commerce Clause and Equal Protection to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.276" offset="14236456">And the State submits that the statute pass its muster under both Equal Protection and Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.173" offset="14271982">Now, also under the Commerce Clause the real market here is not eight-year-old hulks abandoned in Maryland, entitled in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.436" offset="14309076">The market is, in the anti-trust sense, scrap that is the commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.513" offset="14333422">Now, there is no burden on interstate commerce as such here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.951" offset="14347111">There is an alleged burden on one who allegedly participates in interstate commerce namely the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.905" offset="14374905">Now, Pike versus Bruce Church Company is a perfect case in point to illustrate what I am about to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.997" offset="14411267">That leads you to the conclusion, those facts lead to the conclusion, that is an incidental burden which is permissible we submit and as long as local legitimate public interest are served, this dovetails, the Equal Protection arguments and the Commerce Clause arguments and in fact if you want to see large industries that were hit in the pocket book, do not look at Alexandria Scrap because they have not established it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.294" offset="14520459">Look at the American Can Company who has closed up its Washington plant.</text>
