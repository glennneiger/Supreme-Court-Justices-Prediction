            <text syncTime="42.635" offset="273891">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.109" offset="287788">The question in this case here in the writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is whether the Freedom of Information Act requires the disclosures of summaries of proceedings conducted at the Air Force Academy by so called Honor and Ethics Board or Committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.350" offset="368664">These summaries contain the results and the disposition of proceedings conducted by cadet groups of the academy for the enforcement of the Honor Code and the Honor Code is the principal issue in the case and as we refer to it the proceedings under the Ethics Code are relatively infrequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.176" offset="456017">The government contends that these summaries are exempted from disclosure by two exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.966" offset="491126">Exemption 6, which covers personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and Exemption 2 which covers matters related solely to the internal personal rules and procedures of an agency.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="119.715" stopTime="143.386">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="119.715" offset="582136">Mr. Friedman, in your view, does that term unwarranted invasion mean that there is a balancing process that is to balance the importance of the disclosure to the person asking for it against the potential for injury to the subject?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="143.386" stopTime="145.500">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="143.386" offset="676908">I would think so Mr. Chief Justice --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="145.500" offset="685268">And the legislative history shed any light?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="147.383" stopTime="196.352">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="147.383" offset="692895">The legislative history does indicate that in that phrase Congress did intend there to be a balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.422" offset="717033">But I would suggest Mr. Chief Justice that on the one side of the equation, it is probably the more accurately might be phrased as the interested public because under the Freedom of Information Act, any person can get information but it is not required for him to show his need for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.380" offset="784846">I think it is a general public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.347" offset="792683">But in considering the public interest, I think it is appropriate to look to the purposes for which the information is sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.103" offset="819746">But may I just add by way a preliminary thing that our first submission is that under this exemption, you never reach that issue because as I shall develop, we think that personnel and medical files are protected against disclosure without regard to making that showing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="196.352" stopTime="201.094">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="196.352" offset="888709">Does unwarranted invasion of personal privacy modifies only the similar files?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="201.094" stopTime="401.867">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="201.094" offset="907726">That is our submission Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.235" offset="916295">That is our submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.640" offset="921833">And then we go on to say but in any event in this case, there was a clearly unwarranted invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.199" offset="948060">Now the Honor Code of the Air Force Academy states we will not lie, steal or cheat, or tolerate among us any one who does.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.454" offset="989124">The code therefore has two elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.726" offset="998215">First, the substantive development, the ban on lying, cheating, or stealing and secondly, the toleration clause, and what this means is that the code imposes an obligation on the cadets.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.960" offset="1047116">Not only to observe these requirements themselves but to report anybody who fails to comply and in many instances, of course what you have is a cadet report that he saw another cadet cheating who did was lying or doing something dishonest.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.484" offset="1113258">The code was actually created by the cadet core and it is the cadet core that administers it and enforces it.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.147" offset="1147948">If a violation is reported to someone known as an honor representative and what they do is each squadron of the cadet core appoints two honor representatives, they elect them in fact so that you have 80 Honor Representatives whose basic responsibility is to administer the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.672" offset="1217957">If an honor violation is reported, an investigation is conducted by a group of three Honor Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.017" offset="1247423">At this investigation, they take statements from witnesses, talk to the cadet involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.004" offset="1267380">If his result of this investigation it appears that there has been a violation of the Honor Code, then a formal proceeding is instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.792" offset="1306460">A Board of eight cadets is appointed and this Board which is called an Honor Board or an Honor Committee then conducts a hearing at which the cadet appears as well as any witnesses the cadet wishes to call.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.930" offset="1371034">Sworn testimony is not taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.445" offset="1381065">The cadet is informed that he has the right to make a statement or to remain silent and he is also informed that he has the right to call any witnesses he wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.142" offset="1419831">There is no cross-examination and counsel is not permitted to be present at the hearing, although the cadet is given the opportunity prior to the hearing to consult with legal counsel and the staff judge advocate's office at the Air Force Academy.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.637" offset="1485868">This procedure that I have mentioned of course is fully consistent with the basic concept that this code is administered by the cadets and for the cadets.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.587" offset="1529650">Now if at the conclusion of a hearing, the committee finds the cadet guilty of the alleged violations and it has to be a unanimous finding, the cadet normally is expected to resign from the academy.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.620" offset="1585761">If on the other hand they either find the cadet not guilty or they find him guilty but with something called discretion which means that despite the violation, they feel it is appropriate for him to continue at the academy than he returns to the student body.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.480" offset="1657232">The hearing is kept confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.016" offset="1667367">The only people admitted are members and involved and a certain number of cadets plus those officers at the Air Force Academy who are directly involved in conducting the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="480.702" offset="2026081">Now these summaries in turn are then distributed to each of the cadet squadrons.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.893" offset="2054920">There are 40 squadrons and a copy of the summary is distributed to each squadron.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.145" offset="2075922">If the man is found guilty, the man’s name is included.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.408" offset="2096925">If the man is either found not guilty or there is discretion, the man’s name is deleted and it might be shown as Cadet X and Cadet Y or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.023" offset="2135377">These summaries are then placed upon the bulletin board in each squadron in a file which says on the top of it “Honor Case Summary for Official Use Only.”</text>
            <text syncTime="522.700" offset="2194100">Now the reason these –- One other thing in the case of either not guilty or discretion, not all of the summaries are distributed but only those that it is felt by the board of the Honor people would be appropriate as illustrative cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.910" offset="2262959">The reason they are distributed to each of the 40 squadrons and discussed with the honor representatives in the squadron is that the responsibility for the enforcement of the code lies with the Cadet Core and therefore it is essential to the Cadet Core to know the decisions of this Honor Boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.491" offset="2341326">To know what kind of conduct was deemed to violate the code, what kind of conduct was deemed not to violate the code and what kind of conduct was deemed to violate the order but excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.234" offset="2388242">So I think it can fairly be said that the summaries are in effect the end-product of the Honor Board proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.935" offset="5335064">The legislative history of this statute which we have discussed at considerable length in our reply brief indicates that the first bill that really, there were number of early bills but there were two basic bills in the 88th and 89th Congress which culminated the Freedom of Information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.022" offset="5403400">The first Bill had no provision at all exempting personnel files, medical files, or similar files and it apparently was on the assumption that most of these files were protected by other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.668" offset="5453973">But if the hearings on these bill there was complaint by a number of witnesses that they were vast quantities of government files which contained a lot of personal information and that should be protected and they specifically referred to personnel files and medical files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.596" offset="5529728">And following that hearing the Senate added an amendment to the Bill which is set forth at the bottom of page 6 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.090" offset="5571628">And as originally drafted, the amendment provided an exemption for personnel files, medical files, and similar matter the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwanted invasion of personnel privacy and the committee report on that Bill stated that quoted at the top of page 7, in an effort to indicate the types of records which should not be generally available to the public, the Bill lists personnel and medical files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.092" offset="5691687">And since that would be impossible to name all such files, the exemption contains the wording and similar records the disclosure of which would be constant and clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.225" offset="5732229">Now, we think in the light of that committee report and the language as originally drafted, Congress intended the disclosure requirement to modify only similar matter and to provide an unqualified immunity for personal file, personnel files, and medical files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.542" offset="5801506">When Congress finally enacted the Freedom of Information Act, they changed that language to the present language in the Bill and what they did was eliminate the commas, combined personnel and medical files into one category and substitute for the word similar matter, the word similar files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.999" offset="5879351">Again, the legislative history that we have quoted shows that Congress wished to protect the confidentiality of personnel and medical files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.316" offset="5912579">And we do not think this change in language was intended to make any change in the basic design the basic purpose which led to the insertion of this provision in order to protect the confidentiality of personnel files and medical files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.278" offset="5984468">Congress in effect made a judgment that the disclosure of personnel and medical files necessarily would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and then went ahead and recognized, there were other files which contained similar damaging material and it therefore provided an additional exemption for those of the similar files whose disclosure would have this serious impact upon personal privacy.</text>
