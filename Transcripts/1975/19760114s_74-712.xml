            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73672">The judgment and opinion of the Court in number 74-712 of United States against Bornstein will be announced by Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="9.939" offset="113378">Yes, I have been authorized to announce the opinion and judgment of the court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.948" offset="141381">A case in which Mr. justice Stevens took no part whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.980" offset="161548">A case which is here on writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Third circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.272" offset="186730">The False Claims Act, Federal Act provide that the United States may recover from a person [(00:36) - (00:45)audio corrupt] double the amount of damages that the United States has sustained by reason of the false claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.173" offset="282338">This case presents two interpretative problems that arise when the United States sues a subcontractor under the Act on the ground that the subcontractor has caused the prime contractor to present false claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.914" offset="345241">The questions are first, how should the number of $2,000 forfeitures be counted in such a situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="74.753" offset="372617">And Second, when the United States has already recovered damages from the prime contractor because of the subcontractor's fraud, what effect does that recovery have upon the Government's right to recover double damages from the subcontractor?</text>
            <text syncTime="89.495" offset="431550">These problems of statutory construction do not lend themselves to a very interesting or even a very intelligible, oral summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.811" offset="476898">In that respect, this case is akin to the one announced yesterday by my brother Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.314" offset="506887">Suffice it to say that the Court holds today that in determining the number of $2000 forfeitures, the statute requires that the focus must be upon the specific conduct of the person from whom the government is trying to collect the forfeitures.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.905" offset="569267">In this case upon the acts of the subcontractor, not the acts of the prime contractor and that in computing the double damages authorized by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.524" offset="615765">The government's actual damages are to be doubled before any deductions are made for compensatory payments, the government may have previously received from any source.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.333" offset="658919">Application of these principles in the present case, leads to reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.907" offset="693296">I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a separate opinion dissenting in part in which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice White have joined and as I said I think at the outset Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or the decision of this case.</text>
