            <text syncTime="9.835" offset="112953">This case is here from the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.268" offset="134687">In this case a Republican Sheriff of Cook County, Illinois lost out to a Democrat in an election for that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.624" offset="180140">The democratic Sheriff promptly dismissed all the Republican non-civil service employees, not covered by any law protecting them from arbitrary discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.128" offset="234161">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the democratic Sheriff's dismissal of the republicans solely to enable him to give the jobs to deserving Democrats deprived the dismissed Republicans of constitutional freedoms of belief and association secured by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.028" offset="321724">We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.608" offset="336039">Our judgment is supported by two opinions, I filed one in which Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.949" offset="377417">Mr. Justice Stewart joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="86.190" offset="418377">Mr. Justice Powell also dissents and joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
