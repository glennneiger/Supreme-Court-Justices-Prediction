            <label>Mr. John F. Ward, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="75.747" offset="406296">Before getting to the discussion of the issues, facts and circumstances in this case, I dig two points [Voice Overlap] to consider and keep in mind while you are considering the issues and the facts and circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.280" offset="472438">One; East Carroll Parish is in North West Louisiana, a small rural parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.339" offset="488634">In Louisiana, our law requires the Districts Attorneys in our state to represent the local governmental units in their districts such as School Boards and Police Juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.362" offset="536804">Often times a District Attorney will have three parishes in his district which gives him three School Boards, three Police Juries to advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.788" offset="570449">Of course he is primarily a county prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.132" offset="583824">Criminal Law; our District Attorneys are generally understaffed and overworked and their assistants, the view that they have are trained primarily in Criminal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.839" offset="630636">But we do not have for our School Boards unfortunately and our Police Juries a battery of lawyers such as the Solicitor General and Justice Department have, or the lawyers committed to Civil Rights under the Law or even lawyers with the expertise and knowledge in Constitutional Law that Mr. Halpin has from the many cases he has handled with the AC, American Civil Liberties Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.995" offset="719347">I say that not to present a David and Goliath type picture, but merely so that the Court will understand that back in 1971, 68 to 71 when this was in -- the case was in the District Court, that School Board and Police Jury was relying on the advice of an Assistant District Attorney who really had not a great deal of experience in this area of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.807" offset="810567">And also, the second point, this particular area of the law was constantly changing.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.216" offset="836167">It was virtually impossible, really, for lay Police Jury members and lay School Board members to know from day to day what the law really was with regard to reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.621" offset="877858">It was not until really your averred decision that when you reply to local political subdivisions as well as congressional districts and state legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.438" offset="925088">At that time in '68, we tried to anticipate the problem of reapportionment and assist these School Boards as the brace of all three, the respondent, the Solicitor General and Amicus Curiae point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.660" offset="997917">The Louisiana Legislature in 1968 adopted a law which would permit School Boards to reapportion themselves, that was Act 561.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.001" offset="1043370">A similar and not seminar law, but to the same effect was suggested by the Police Juries, Act 445.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.885" offset="1078897">It is animated and the plaintiffs -- respondent’s brief and the government's brief that because in prior years the School Board members and the Police Jury members had been elected from wards within a parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.878" offset="1150890">That when the Legislature switched to a reapportionment plan which would permit At-Large Districts that there was some invidious motive in switching from single member districts, if you could call our Police Jury Ward Single-member District, they really were not, because some of them were Multi-Member.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.917" offset="1226959">But the switch-in from that system to a possible Permissive At-Large System was designed to discriminate against black citizens and to deny them the right to vote and the right to participate in the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.417" offset="1284951">Nothing could be farther from the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.873" offset="1298848">For the School Boards Association, the Louisiana School Boards Association which is a non-profit advisory service type organization which I happen to represent, I drafted the legislation or the School Boards that the legislature adopted, Act 561.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.118" offset="1367811">It was slightly amended in the legislature, but basically we were lucky and it came through pretty much in as it went in.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.369" offset="1396755">We never considered once, the possibility of that at-large feature, permissive at-large feature being used to discriminate a back against black citizens or to dilute their vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.256" offset="1444402">We simply wanted to give our School Boards as much latitude as possible in trying to devise the best plan that they could to help them provide the best possible education system they could in their parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.932" offset="1503021">The Attorney General of our state, somewhat delays, submitted those two acts to the Attorney General of the United States as required by the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.939" offset="1555057">He entered an objection due to the at-large feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.203" offset="1580134">We spent, myself and Mr. James Prescott who was Executive Secretary of the Louisiana School Boards Association about two years with numerous phone calls and correspondents trying to convince the Attorney General that since that the at-large feature was permissive and since the Voting Rights Act would require submission of local governmental units reapportionment plans to him, there was no need for him to object to the State Legislation and not only that, but because of his objection we now find that some School Boards, I say them particularly because I represent them more than I do Police Juries, could not reapportion because of the inoperativeness of the State Legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.068" offset="1803638">The Police Jury Act was much shorter.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.782" offset="1810430">It is simply repealed a lot of the statutes tying Police Juries to wards whereas our Act went into more detail, limited the smallness and the maximum size of the board within their discretion, permitted Single member districts or At-Large Districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.170" offset="1871974">As probably it just as part of the one reason for that was that School Boards had been tied to Police Juries’ historically.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.842" offset="1914711">Simply we like same School Board members, and same wards elect, Police Juries and the School Boards have wanted to get away from that for many years --</text>

            <text syncTime="527.973" offset="2215223">We ultimate were successful in getting the Attorney General, convincing him that he could withdraw his objection to the Permissive Legislation which he did in '72 after this case had gone through the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.004" offset="2279380">Now, when it was before the District Court originally, it was on a suit on the Fourteenth Amendment grounds of one man, one vote in '68. Of course an At-Large System meets one man, one vote requirement perfectly with zero deviation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.544" offset="6529502">In other cases, even though a suit has been filed, and our problem back in '71, particularly with Connor versus Johnson, we did not know how far Connor versus Johnson went and suits were being filed and the district attorneys relied on their district judges and the district judges' docket is not the only one interpreted Connor versus Johnson to apply even when he did not devise the plan himself, but had compelled the plan, through a court order directed the legislative body to submit a plan to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.402" offset="6656980">I think you can decide the merits of this case under these circumstances on the merits and hold this At-Large plan as being constitutionally permissible under these circumstances and make an alternative decision on -- as to other cases under the Section 5 position of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.770" offset="6898456">However, I checked this and my information is that there was only a short period of time of approximately three weeks during the summer of '75 in which this was the case due to a flux in adaption of the New Louisiana Constitution which enfranchised a new segment of people and blacks in the parish as they always do their work hard and got sort of a jump on the registration for a few weeks, but then the registration went back to it is normal level so that the figures that I have obtained from -- had someone obtain from the registrar of voters in East Carroll Parish yesterday are as follows: that there are 3,511 blacks registered and 3759 whites registered or a white majority of 248 voters.</text>

            <text syncTime="4105.845" offset="16526668">I will be very brief Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.823" offset="16534609">I have somewhat the same problem with the Section 5 argument that Justice White has raised. On the one hand the government says if the court finds a body of malapportioned, orders it to submit a plan, it submits a plan under a lawsuit filed by plaintiff, plaintiffs submit is a plan, so you have an intervener also submits a plan, if the court chooses the plan submitted by the political subdivision it is subject to Section 5 review.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Ward, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="4137.988" offset="16655295">Or any part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.149" offset="16659893">It chooses on the other hand the plaintiff's plan as being the best the plan, it is not subject to Section 5 review.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.106" offset="16683716">The same would be true with the intervener plan which begs, it seems to me to beg the question one time, one plan that just took the Voting Rights Act requires clearance by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.560" offset="16737529">Another plan doing -- having the same effect or different effect, but in the same purpose is not subject to pre-clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.627" offset="16765845">This case, I think you can decide on its facts even on the record before you without the update.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.107" offset="16795729">That the-- although opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court Of Appeals which held, which reversed the District Court and held that an At-Large plan discriminates against blacks where blacks are in a majority in population, but slightly less than a majority in registered voters, it is not accord with your previous decisions in White v. Regester, it is arguing over a minimal difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.906" offset="16906907">For example, the voter registration figures, at that time, 3,342 white, 2,899 black, a 443 more white registered voters than black.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.340" offset="16964689">My figures as of, when I filed my brief, new figures with 3,550 white, black rather, 3,533 or a 17 more black registered voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.245" offset="17028324">If you went to the registered democrats because in my state we are almost a one party system unfortunately, the difference will be considerably greater in number of more blacks registered than white.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.875" offset="17094779">But when you go to Mr. Halpin’s figure which he says he got by telephone call from the registrar, it shows as now more white registered voters than black, but again the difference of only 242 between 17 to 242 to 443, that is such a minimal difference that it is virtually impossible and it is inconceivable to me that that makes an At-Large plan constitutionally impermissible, that slight difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.083" offset="17203658">When a parish with a majority population like this, black and white, pretty near equal, 55-58% black registered voters are going to vary from year to year depending on age of children for one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.353" offset="17248693">Another thing that I think that you must remember, before the Court of Appeals, this plan in effect, blacks have been elected to the School Board and have been elected to the Police Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.145" offset="17299893">I might direct your attention to the appendix at pages 119 through 121 I believe in which a number of the Police Jury is questioned during the hearing in July of '71.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.788" offset="17354436">As to the town of Lake Providence and which is the only large town in the parish and is questioned as to the black population being virtually almost two to one, greater than white, he testifies also that part of their past history, no black had ever been elected as alderman in the town of Lake Providence even though they were on At-Large and the black majority is almost two to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.704" offset="17462165">But today gentleman all five alderman are black.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.242" offset="17480347">The mayor of the town is black.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.146" offset="17491945">The respondent himself who was previously defeated for the office of City Marshall has now been elected City Marshall and is City Marshall today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.664" offset="17526009">I respectfully submit to you that under the facts and circumstances in this case, this plan is not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.333" offset="17564670">The Fifth Circuit;s en banc decision should be reversed and the District Court’s original order implementing this At-Large System should be approved.</text>
