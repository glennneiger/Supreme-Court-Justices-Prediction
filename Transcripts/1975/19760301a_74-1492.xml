            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104796">We will hear arguments first this morning in number 74-1492, Washington against Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.111" offset="153175">Mr. Sutton you may proceed when ever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_p_sutton" startTime="15.047" stopTime="208.315">
            <label>Mr. David P. Sutton</label>
            <text syncTime="15.047" offset="164982">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, at its threshold this case presents two highly important societal values.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.585" offset="203121">The right of a community to be free from discrimination in Public employment and to the right of a community to a competent Police Force is our position that both of these values maybe rationally upheld in this case, such a failure and necessarily leads to the statement of the basic issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.932" offset="292460">At the time the Certiorari Petition came before this Court, the issue were two in numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.484" offset="314716">First, whether the Metropolitan Police Departments Test 21, its entrance test has an adverse racial impact and secondly whether that test is rationally related to ones ability to be trained as the Policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.568" offset="383052">Later in proceeding before this Court, the Federal Government has injected a third issue into the case and that is whether or not this Court may adequately deal with the case on existing Summary Judgment Record which came to it as opposed to remanding the case to the District Court, so that we may begin all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.038" offset="464868">I would like to take up these issues individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.940" offset="480541">In essence our position is that Test 21 does not have irrationally disproportion of impact, in any event as job related and that a remand as suggested by Federal Government which served no useful purpose and would indeed subvert the interest of Judicial Economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.346" offset="550132">I will turn briefly to the impact issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.209" offset="561625">We do not ask this Court to single out any one factor in dealing with the impact issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.241" offset="581687">It is our position that there are four factors or four equal employment badges of credibility which conclusively negate an adverse impact and that these factors may find support in this Courts decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.943" offset="636545">First, vigorous minority recruitment, there is no question that since Chief Wilson took office in 1969 the department has vigorously, aggressively, unwaveringly, sought to recruit blacks into the Department and has succeeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.042" offset="696940">Let us talk about the applicant pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.493" offset="706762">In this Courts most recent decision on the subject Albermarle Paper Company versus Moody, this Court spoke in terms of a test which has a racial pattern significantly different from that of the pool of applicants, for the most two recent years for which statistics are available, 1970 and 1971, 53% of all the applicants were black and 43% of all the new Policeman were black.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.178" offset="825462">We have a 10% under representation, we submit this does not indicate an adverse impact, but we do not ask the Court to stop here; we have two more badges of credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.993" offset="864750">First, we may fairly compare those in the 20 to 29 H category hired by the Department, the eligibles, 44% between 1969 and the time the Court rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.344" offset="930161">Now for some reason --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="208.315" stopTime="214.164">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="208.315" offset="937998">That is a total of 44% of all the applicants of both of all races were hired?</text>
          </turn>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="217.481" stopTime="218.262">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="217.481" offset="974674">I see.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_p_sutton" startTime="218.262" stopTime="501.389">
            <label>Mr. David P. Sutton</label>
            <text syncTime="218.262" offset="977808">54%, but this must be compared Your Honor; Mr. Justice Stewart with the blacks and the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area which is considerably lesser than the 50 mile radius from which the Department recruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.408" offset="1038412">Now the SMSA or Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, figures applicable to this age group.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.695" offset="1063490">In 1970, at the time this case was spending was 24%.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.283" offset="1077909">So we double that, but again we do not ask the Court to stop there, I would like to borrow on this Court's very language in Griggs and this, I think is perhaps one of the most important impact tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.073" offset="1116989">In Griggs this Court emphasized, that the question is not one of intentional discrimination, it is a question of a practice which is neutralized space, but which has the effect of locking in or freezing a racially unacceptable status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.870" offset="1176234">For that reason this Court said in Griggs that under the act, Civil Right Act, practices, procedure or a tests neutral on their face and even neutral in terms of intent cannot be maintained, if they operate to freeze the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.373" offset="1250213">How about a test that does the opposite?</text>
            <text syncTime="288.979" offset="1260662">The record does show in this case that in 1965, which co-incidentally was the effective date of the Civil Rights Act Title VII, the department's black component was 17%.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.902" offset="1308309">The record showed that that components spiral overwhelmingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.022" offset="1324819">The records shows for example, that between 1967 and 1970, the black component of the department increased 228%, the white component 47%.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.493" offset="1374765">Now recent statistics which in the report prepared by the District Humans Right office which will soon be available, is on the Mayor's desk right now shows that presently the department's Black Component is 41.2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.142" offset="1425338">Now this is the officer of status quo freezing, instead of lacking in a discriminatory practice of yesteryear, this dissipates anything that could arguably exist between what went on in the past and what went on now.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.606" offset="1475180">We do not ask the Court to consider anyone of this practice, we ask the Court to consider the totality of the practice and we respectfully submit that the Court does, does the Court will find that no adverse impact exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.884" offset="1520319">I would now like to turn to job relatedness and I would like to spend as much time as I can on the late contention of the Federal Respondents, that this Court cannot deal with the matter on the existing record for what of available psychological data, But first of all, again we begin with the Albermarle pronouncement; this Court in Albermarle said that in essence that will continue to consider two factors on job relatedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.723" offset="1635676">The job relatedness is a contextual matter, must be considered in the context of the employers operation first of all and secondly in the history of the testing program.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.107" offset="1681129">Well, let us take the employers operation which necessarily requires that we focus on a policeman’s job.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.607" offset="1707147">Now, what kind of a job we are talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="402.938" offset="1716447">The Policeman of today is not the village constable of yesteryear.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.355" offset="1734210">He lives and performs in an age of evolving legal concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.240" offset="1749674">He must necessarily have some kind of knowledge or familiarity with the laws of arrest, stop and frisk, search and seizure, and this is the age of Miranda v. Arizona and Carey v. Ohio, then too the policemen must have some kind of basic understanding of the component or constituent elements of the various criminal offenses with which he will be concerned when he works as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.928" offset="1848417">He must be reasonably skilled in a report writing, in the language of the dissenting judge and the Court below, he must be articulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.431" offset="1874435">In the language of this Court, in Albermarle, he must have job specific ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.607" offset="1903170">The department's training curriculum which is before of this Court discusses all this areas as matter which recruits shall be exposed to arrest, search, seizure et cetera, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.828" offset="1944025">And for that reason we respectfully submit,it is designed to impart the kind of job specific ability that this Court referred to in the Albermarle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.284" offset="1989896">Obviously, want these verbal ability to understand these materials, to understand the law of arrest, search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.719" offset="2015601">It is undisputed, that Test 21 is a straight forward test of verbal ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.227" offset="2037648">The test requires a job specific ability that is training related on its face as Judge Rob so held, we could stop there if we wanted to but we do not have to because we have considerably more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.893" offset="2084355">I would now like to turn to the second contextual criterion.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.434" offset="2142452">They said that in essence as we say that it is does not predict trainability, they took question where issue with is cut off score of 40 and they stressed the fact that since nobody fail a recruit school, we could not use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.393" offset="2190308">I think that this comes in rather nicely with the history of the testing program and that will tell us an lawful lot with respect to the appendix or—.</text>

            <text syncTime="542.105" offset="2273168">But, particularly suited to the policeman because that it is geared to the high school graduate and respondent concede that the high school education is sufficient, is required to be a policeman, authoritative study throughout the country including the President's Crime Commission, take a similar position.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.913" offset="2340355">While it is generally geared to any job which in turn requires the high school education.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.210" offset="2361567">We respectfully submit as peculiarly suitable to this job, when study galore insists upon a policeman having not high a school education but more, some people would say college degree, we do not to go that far on this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.578" offset="2611088">It was issued then on the effective date of the 1965 Civil Rights Act like the test in Griggs versus Duke Power Company in which there was almost intentional discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3484.809" offset="14043944">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I would like to start with Justice Powell’s inquiry concerning the basis of the suit and to clarify, one or two misconceptions that have creped in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.237" offset="14081665">There was three basis for this action as alleged in the complaint which appears on page 24 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.904" offset="14112385">The action was based on Fifth Amendment to United States Constitution in the Equal Protection requirements implicit therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.634" offset="14143314">It was based on section 1981 of the Title 42 which as far as I understand that it is not a procedural statue but is a substantive statute creating a private right of action against racial discrimination and employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.501" offset="14190752">It is unlike 1983, in that regard as the opinions of this Court and for example DC against Carter make clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.993" offset="14220740">Third it was based on the District of Columbia code 1-320 which prohibits racial discrimination and employment in the District of Columbia and there was jurisdiction alleged for each of these basis of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.959" offset="14280613">So, in essence the way the case reaches the Court, this Court, the issue is not the bald issue of whether Title VII standard are the same as constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.558" offset="14322932">It is whether the composite of Section 1981 of Title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.184" offset="14345501">The prohibition against racial discrimination and employment in DC code and the Fifth Amendment together represent a lower standard, than the Title VII standard and I would submit that is not the case that the Courts have treated 1981 as equivalent at the least to Title VII in its prohibition against racial discrimination and employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.429" offset="14430452">But moving to the Constitutional issue, I would say this that the test creates a classification between those who pass it and those who do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.513" offset="14470785">At the very minimum, the issue is whether there is rational basis for that classification and we take the position that there is no difference between the question of whether a classification is rational and whether a test is related to a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.393" offset="14522298">It is essentially the same question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.976" offset="14528672">We do not need in this case to get into the details of the EEOC guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.927" offset="14548420">That is not an issue, we simply say that there is a requirement under any of these basis of authority that the defendants make a showing at least rationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.971" offset="14584678">Rationality for the use of an employment test would mean that the test has some relationship to the job in some respect and it is our position that their showing has not been made here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5566.608" offset="22371154">That is all that is in the record answer to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.819" offset="22384006">I would like to very briefly get to a point that really has not been discussed and that is the issue of whether there has been a validation study here which has indicated that Test 21 is validated against success in training.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.774" offset="22439803">The Court of Appeals did not decide the question of whether training is an appropriate criterion for the validation of a test, and it is very clear from its opinion, it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.438" offset="22478465">I stress that because there seems to be an invitation tendered by the amici, if no else for the Court to decide broad questions of whether test can be validated against training.</text>
            <text syncTime="5603.784" offset="22519843">The Court found that the Court of Appeals found and I am referring the footnote 59 on page 16 (a) and 17 (a), that there was no showing that Test 21 predicted success in training and we think that holding is correct and that the abstract question of whether training is a proper criterion should not be reached and very briefly, the reason why the Court of Appeals held, I think correctly that there was no such showing, is that there had been, there is no proof that -- let me put it differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.448" offset="22650559">Success in training is a successful completion of recruit school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5640.699" offset="22667591">That is the only measure of success in training which has ever been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.965" offset="22680652">Every recruit passed recruit school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5646.758" offset="22691728">Now the department essentially asked the Court to assume that persons who did not achieve a score of 40 on Test 21 could not pass recruit school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.319" offset="22729972">But if the cut off was score was 45 or 50, the proof in this case would be identical and the proof I referred to was there be correlation between a level of passing score in Test 21 and the level of passing score in recruit school and the same argument could then be made that anyone who did not get a 50 could not pass recruit school and of course we have a record here where thousands upon thousands got between 40 and 50 and went on to recruit school and succeeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5681.488" offset="22830700">There is no different between the hypothetical, I put and the facts here, there is absolutely no basis for assuming that a person who scored 35 on this test could not succeed in recruit school and succeed as a policeman and the defendants expert Frutransky, the one recommendation he made was that the cut off score was too high, that he demanded more than what was necessary to predict success in recruit school.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.345" offset="22918158">He recommended it to be lower but of course that the point he chose, he had no basis for either, and the authorities who have indicated in our brief do indicate that there ought to be a study of this question of where on the scale between 0 and 80 on Test 21, is there some indication that this is the proper measure and not an excessive measure of the verbal ability needed to perform the task of a policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.908" offset="23008332">We ask that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.174" offset="23021394">We think there is plenty of room on remand pursuing to the Court of Appeals judgment to explore any issues of later developments in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5737.656" offset="23055353">One thing which is crucial later development is that the defense is moot and that, they do not use these recruit school tests that the affidavits put in by the defendants make perfectly clear, in 1972 the whole system of written test in recruit school was abandoned and Chief Justice -- I am really confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="5757.363" offset="23134243">Chief Murray said in his affidavit that because there was a change in recruit school, he had no basis for making any judgment as to whether Test 21 was valid as against the current training procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.449" offset="23198504">Now that is a very important question in the case, since the whole defense is based on correlation with an exam that was abandoned four years ago and it is not now used.</text>

            <text syncTime="5820.039" offset="23384914">My point is that in affirmance of the Court of the Appeals decision is not the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.215" offset="23401632">It is simply an end of the Frutransky study and an end of the issue of whether as off 1971, the department had shown the test was valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="6048.452" offset="24298572">However, it would by fairness and by the same logic represent verbal ability below the high school education level, and it would run counterproductive to the high school education requirement, the sufficiently of which counsel concedes, but let us not stop there.</text>
