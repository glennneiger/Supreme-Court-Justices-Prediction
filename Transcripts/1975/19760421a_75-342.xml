            <text syncTime="54.476" offset="217861">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.247" offset="228937">The issue in this case is whether the Federal Power Commission has the statutory authority to reduce a public utility’s otherwise just and reasonable electric wholesale rate because the utility allegedly maintains artificially depressed and anticompetitive retail rates.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="75.753" stopTime="105.111">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="75.753" offset="302916">Mr. Tuttle, you didn’t in your petition I know raised the question of the finality of the Commission’s ruling that was reviewed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.964" offset="343771">From your own knowledge, is it a common practice in the agency proceedings where petition for intervention has been partially granted and partially denied by the Commission for the party that is partially denied to run to the Court of Appeals at that stage and seek together reviewed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allan_abbot_tuttle" startTime="105.111" stopTime="215.432">
            <label>Mr. Allan Abbot Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="105.111" offset="420362">It is not a common practice and of course when it occurs, the Commission’s position would ordinarily be and indeed was in the Court of Appeals that the issue was premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.149" offset="472503">As you know, the Court of Appeals, in this case, disagreed with that argument which we made indicated that the Commission had obviously reached a final conclusion as to this issue and that the interest of justice required the court to reach the issue at that juncture because the Commission had made that ruling in a number of other cases and the court felt that there was no indication that any further elaboration of that issue would help resolve the question of the Commission’s power at that juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.855" offset="615340">The Court of Appeals, having made that ruling and having reached the merits of the case, we, of course, proceeded that this court addressing the merits of the Commission statutory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.115" offset="660376">This litigation arose in June of 1973, when Arkansas Power and Light filed with the Commission a wholesale rate increase request under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.851" offset="719308">Conway Corporation, the respondent here is a wholesale customer of Arkansas Power and intervened in the proceedings alleging that the filing was made for anticompetitive purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.695" offset="774687">Conway asserted that it competed with Arkansas Power, its supplier, for direct sales of electricity to industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.926" offset="807602">And Conway alleged that by raising the wholesale rate to it while keeping the retail rate to industry low, Arkansas Power was effectively squeezing Conway out of competition for direct industrial sales.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="215.432" offset="861727">But what is Conway’s business?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allan_abbot_tuttle" startTime="217.462" stopTime="224.966">
            <label>Mr. Allan Abbot Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="217.462" offset="869773">Conway is a -- there is a municipal electric system in Conway and Conway Corporation manages it.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="224.966" stopTime="226.424">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="224.966" offset="899762">In the municipality of Conway?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allan_abbot_tuttle" startTime="226.424" stopTime="707.669">
            <label>Mr. Allan Abbot Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="226.424" offset="905613">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.739" offset="914913">Conway urged that the increase be rejected or reduced in order to eliminate this price squeeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.477" offset="941871">Federal Power Commission rejected this suggestion concluding that the relief sought, the rejection or reduction of the wholesale rate increase was not within its power to grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.840" offset="991295">Under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act, the Commission is charged with assuring the justness and reasonableness of wholesale electric rates in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.103" offset="1032359">It has, however, no authority to set retail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.716" offset="1050854">The Federal Power Commission concluded that it could not as Conway was suggesting based the wholesale rate on the non-jurisdictional retail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.372" offset="1089411">The Commission said and this occurs at page 53 of the record, “Wholesale rates must recover allocated wholesale costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.990" offset="1123892">Conway suggested relief as a rate not related to wholesale costs but rather related to Arkansas Power’s industrial rate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="289.217" offset="1156807">“However, that industrial rate,” the Commission said, “is subject to the sole jurisdiction of the State Commission and not the Federal Power Commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="298.632" offset="1194527">The Court of Appeals reversed holding that the Federal Power Commission had a responsibility under Sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act to remedy an alleged discrimination between a jurisdictional wholesale rate and a non-jurisdictional retail rate cause by, and these are the court’s words, “the utility’s own decision to depress certain retail revenues in order to curb retail competition from its wholesale customers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="327.546" offset="1310093">The operative statute here in Section 205 (b) of the Federal Power Act which provides, “No public utility shall with respect to any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission maintain any unreasonable differences in rates, charges, services, facilities or in any other respect either as between localities or classes of service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="351.105" offset="1404343">The scope of this provision and most significantly the significance of the limiting language with respect to any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission can only be understood with reference to the legislative history of the 1935 Power Act, and perhaps more important, the impact of this Court’s 1914 decision in the Shreveport Case upon that legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.489" offset="1513953">Briefly, Shreveport involved the question of the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission under the Interstate Commerce Act to remedy a discrimination between jurisdictional wholesale railroad rates and non-jurisdictional intrastate railroad rates set by the Texas Railroad Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.353" offset="1597336">Based on this Court’s view of the broad and unexceptional language of the antidiscrimination provisions in the Interstate Commerce Act, this Court in 1914 concluded that the Commerce Commission could require an increase of a non-jurisdictional intrastate rate which discriminated against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.096" offset="1692317">The Shreveport Case figured prominently in the 1935 debates or hearings, I should say, on the Wheeler-Raybum Bill which with modification became the Federal Power Act of 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.829" offset="1747278">Section 202 of the original bill, the forerunner of Section 205, provided in part, “no public utility should establish or maintain any unreasonable difference as to rates, charges, service, facilities, or in any other respect either as between localities or as between classes of service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="460.086" offset="1840274">At the hearings on the Bill, the solicitor of the Federal Power Commission who was a draftsman of the Bill was asked if the Shreveport case would apply if the retail rates were so low that for a company to exist, it became necessary to charge exorbitant rates for its wholesale interstate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.045" offset="1924180">He argued that it would not apply to the Bill as drafted and maintained and this is a quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.203" offset="1948735">“The intrastate rate should be determined upon its reasonable,” excuse me I misspoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.951" offset="1971722">“The interstate rate, the jurisdictional rate, should be determined upon its reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.027" offset="1992098">Its reasonableness alone without regard to what the intrastate rate is.”</text>
            <text syncTime="505.503" offset="2021982">Despite these and other assurances as the scope of the Wheeler-Raybum Bill, the concern remained that owing to the broad and unexceptional language of Section 202 that I’ve read to you, that the Shreveport Case might nonetheless govern the law if enacted in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.196" offset="2092722">Accordingly, the Act was amended -- the Bill was amended and the words added which became the words of Section 205.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.205" offset="2124800">Section 205 as enacted provided, no public utility shall and these are the added words to which I want to call your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.568" offset="2158237">No public utility shall with respect to any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission maintain any unreasonable differences in rates, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.784" offset="2203063">Following these amendments, Representative Cole, who was a sponsor of the Bill, stated, “We have tried, I think, successfully to avoid the interjection of federal control into intrastate activities in a way in which the Shreveport Case might permit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="569.840" offset="2279340">This wording of the Act has led Justice Jackson concurring in Colorado interstate to make the only statement that a member of this Court has made on precisely the issue involved in this state -- in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.683" offset="2330645">And he said at 324 U.S. at 615, the Act forbids discrimination only as between regulated rates and does not forbid discrimination between regulated and unregulated ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.494" offset="2401907">Despite this legislative history, the Court of Appeals concluded that Section 205, as enacted, did not require that both rates involved in the pattern of discrimination fall within the jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.774" offset="2459063">The court argued that if Congress had intended to limit Section 205 to competitions merely between jurisdictional rates, it would’ve added to the end of the section the following words, classes of service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, rather than as the act reads merely the words classes of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.431" offset="2537639">Thus, according to the Court of Appeals, if the Congress had wished to limit Section 205 to discriminations between jurisdictional sales, this is what it would have had to have said, no public utility shall with respect to any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission maintain any unreasonable differences in rates between classes of service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.285" offset="2645055">However, the repetition of the phrase subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission at the end of Section 205 is obviously redundant because by its terms the statute is already limited to quote “any transmission or sale subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission”.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.881" offset="2723422">Based on Congress’ failure to repeat this obviously redundant phrase, the Court of Appeal said that the Commission was required to address the question or the issue of discriminations between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.604" offset="2786325">Its only concession was to say that any sanction imposed by the FPC to remedy in any competitive practice is to be addressed to the jurisdictional rate.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="707.669" stopTime="715.491">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="707.669" offset="2830629">What if the Court of Appeals had just said the Commission could consider it and not that it was required to consider it, would you regard that holding as wrong?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allan_abbot_tuttle" startTime="715.491" stopTime="747.446">

            <text syncTime="715.491" offset="2861871">I would Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.291" offset="2869081">I think that the -- our principal analysis of the statute is that we are limited in the matters that we are to concern ourselves with, with matters which may not be the subject of state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.716" offset="2930834">And our view of our statute is that the only discrimination which we may address within the ambit of Section 205 and 206 is the discrimination between jurisdictional rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.051" offset="2980153">And that is our fundamental submission in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="747.446" offset="2989767">Mr. Tuttle, is it not true that in making the determination of reasonableness on the wholesale rate, you do have to make some preliminary judgment as to whether costs are probably allocated, do you not?</text>

            <text syncTime="765.081" offset="3060297">Well, it involves an allocation, as you say, of costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.347" offset="3077329">And there’s no question that we may look to the retail business to the extent of determining that the wholesale rate and the wholesale rate payers are not being loaded with more costs than would justify according to the amount of the investment, which is put to that service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.717" offset="5478818">That’s my first point that I wish to make with the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.212" offset="5492820">But in any event, it seems to me that the ordinary federal standards of rate making would forbid us to remedy this discrimination by lowering the wholesale rate which is what the remedy that the Court of Appeals suggested and the remedy that Conway had suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.799" offset="5547154">Because the wholesale rate has to recover allocated wholesale costs and the relief that Conway suggests the reduction of the wholesale rate is not related to wholesale costs but it’s related to retail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.810" offset="5607236">This Court in the Shreveport case, in discussing circumstances where the court found the power to address the discrimination between the jurisdictional and a non-jurisdictional rate held that that situation cannot be remedied by sacrificing federal standards of ratemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.206" offset="5680797">And the court said and this is at 234 U.S. 355.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.406" offset="5701590">“It is clear that in removing the injurious discrimination against interstate traffic arising from the relationship of the intrastate to the interstate rate, Congress is not bound to reduce the latter below what it may deem to be the proper standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.800" offset="5767105">Thus our obligations are to assure a just and reasonable jurisdictional rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.299" offset="5789153">And we’re not in the position and we’re not allowed under our ratemaking responsibilities to sacrifice that rate in order to remedy a discrimination caused by an anticompetitive non-jurisdictional rate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.152" offset="5844532">The Court of Appeals suggested that this whole problem could -- of not being able to lower the wholesale rate might be avoided by reference to its concept of a zone of reasonable wholesale rates and suggested that we might reduce the wholesale rate to the lower range of the zone of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.728" offset="5914854">And therefore, have some effect on the price squeeze situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.342" offset="5941290">We don’t think that the -- that there is an adequate zone or a zone in a wholesale ratemaking which allows us to effectuate this kind of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.709" offset="5982772">In setting rates, the Commission is required to set a rate which will assure adequate and reliable electric power at that least cost while maintaining the financial integrity of the utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.296" offset="6029166">In setting that rate, the Commission does not locate a zone of reasonable rates and then select a rate within the zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.738" offset="6054870">Rather, it attempts to find the just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.887" offset="6071484">It evaluates items of cause such as plant investment, fuel cost, labor and management expenses, capital cost, depreciation and taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.167" offset="6104607">These are knowable, measurable figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.876" offset="6115474">They can and should be precisely quantified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.783" offset="6127073">And their evaluation does not create a zone of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.621" offset="6142433">The only zone of reasonableness that might be found in utility ratemaking is the range of potentially appropriate rates of return on that investment rate base, specifically, rate of return on common equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.343" offset="6193319">But we don’t think that here is an appropriate place to make an adjustment because of allegations of anticompetitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.460" offset="6221740">The Commission must select a rate of return which is commensurate with the risk associated with investment which will maintain the existing investment which will attract new investment at a reasonable cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.668" offset="6266671">And we think that it doesn’t make sense to select that rate on any other grounds than those criteria stated because of allegations of anticompetitive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.852" offset="6307318">But our fundamental contention is that Justice Jackson was right when he said in the Colorado Interstate case, “The Act forbids discrimination only as between regulated rates and does not forbid discrimination between the regulated and unregulated ones.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.981" offset="6383909">And we don’t think that this conclusion creates a regulatory gap requiring the court to expand on the plain words of Section 205.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.091" offset="6420271">I’ve already addressed the possibilities of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.713" offset="6430824">But I also think it’s worth noting that price squeeze in an unlikely event in the nature of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.355" offset="6453394">As I’ve indicated, the Commission’s ordinary rate making standards with respect to wholesale rates assure that there would be no artificially inflated wholesale rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.295" offset="6489130">So that no price squeeze caused by such rates could arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.679" offset="6502713">Moreover, in an industry where 80 to 90% of the business comes from retail revenues, it seems unlikely that a truly anticompetitive rate would be created or maintained on the retail side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.496" offset="6549943">Of course if it does, if this does happen, there is another remedy Mr. Justice Stevens I didn’t mentioned, Congress can expand upon the powers of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.757" offset="6582962">And in fact there are currently pending four separate bills addressed to Congress’ responsibility with respect to unfair methods of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.193" offset="6616712">Alternatively, of course as I’ve suggested, there may be remedies before the State Commission or remedies under the antitrust clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.143" offset="6644506">Accordingly, I submit that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.741" offset="7894936">Three years ago, I stood here while the FPC was saying similar things in the Gulf States case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.775" offset="7927014">There it said that it didn’t have to worry about anticompetitive problems under Section 204 of the Federal Power Act because it could deal with such problems by treating the actual problems when they occur, the acts of the company rather than the financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.474" offset="7997858">And that court -- that case is, well review was being had of a decision of the courts below here at the same court, also unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.062" offset="8036206">In that case, the majority of this Court agreed that the FPC did have the responsibility to look at what had then claimed was non-jurisdictional problems, anticompetitive problems and to deal with it within the context of Section 204.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.724" offset="8106841">The minority of this Court and a decision written by Mr. Justice Powell agreed that the Commission had the responsibility to deal with anticompetitive problems when the problem was presented to it in the course of a case where the conduct was being challenged such as ratemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.219" offset="8208823">We thought the FPC’s position at that time was something of a shell game and trying to find jurisdiction somewhere else without quite saying where it was and we think it’s similar here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.068" offset="8504216">As they pointed out there are at least a dozen methods, accepted methods of ratemaking, differential allocation, differential assumptions of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.827" offset="8547265">The FPC for example sets rates on the basis of estimates of cost, not actual cost but estimates of cost made by the company in advance -- a year in advance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2168.212" offset="8672758">But the fact of the matter is that it’s very easy for a power company to file a higher rate at the FPC.</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.985" offset="9495928">And there is a very real and very present problem, a serious one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.101" offset="9524349">Now, we pleaded here a discrimination in historic terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.519" offset="9562070">We also pleaded the discrimination in price squeeze terms under the Sherman Act under the Alcoa, Southern Photo line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.703" offset="9598746">The FPC concedes for this purpose -- the purpose of this case that that must be the basis upon which this decision is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.703" offset="9638766">And I think in fact that’s -- we will have no problem proving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.169" offset="9668650">But the Commission urges that it has no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.177" offset="9708669">I find it very difficult to follow its reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.895" offset="9723507">One way in which the statute could easily have been written by Congress if it meant what the FPC said it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.534" offset="9754122">It’s if it had written at the same way as the FPC quoted it in its application for certiorari in this case, misquoted, just adding an S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.452" offset="9793724">The Commission isn’t claiming that anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.127" offset="9804487">But this is an element of a very historic kind of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.606" offset="9854328">Originally, monopolies of this type were controlled by common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.069" offset="9876271">The most common problem that arose at common law was when there was discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.211" offset="9900826">And the courts found no problem in those cases in saying it is very simple, just end the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.509" offset="9929979">We don’t have to have worry about what the costs are and the discrimination raise both rates or lower them both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.457" offset="9965819">The Sherman Act provides for a remedy under the antitrust laws, trouble damage not simple damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.860" offset="10011376">The Robinson-Patman Act, if it applies, would provide for a trouble damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.518" offset="10038021">Under Part I of the Federal Power Act or the Original Water Power Act of 1920 is very clear that the Federal Power Commission would have had jurisdiction to deal with this discrimination and this discrimination precisely if there were no State Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.740" offset="10122867">Arkansas Power and Light is a licensee of the nation’s water resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.060" offset="10148153">Part I plainly makes the -- a licensee subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission to avoid discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.962" offset="10183784">And that jurisdiction terminates as to those matters for which a state provides a regulatory agency to deal but only as to those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.376" offset="10245433">The Commission and Arkansas say that there is no state agency to deal with this discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.328" offset="10285244">And they say the Federal Power Commission can’t either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.353" offset="10297365">We think that’s wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.689" offset="10306664">Prior to 1927, when this Court decided the Attleboro case, it seemed clear that a State Commission could resolve this discrimination problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.138" offset="10364552">In Attleboro, this Court decided that the so-called Attleboro gap existed that the States could not control sales at wholesale for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.929" offset="10415647">The Federal Power Commission was in 1935, it is part of the Public Utilities Act of 1935 given the responsibility to deal with the matters which had been left open by this court at Attleboro are opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.276" offset="10489104">This Court has said in numerous occasions, most frequently FPC against Florida Power and Light, also in FPC against Southern California Edison that Congress intended fully to plug the so called Attleboro gap to fill that responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.811" offset="10587220">But the FPC here says, no, they don’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.137" offset="10612506">Mr. Tuttle’s position is sort of strange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.120" offset="10620447">I am not quite sure that I follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.229" offset="10632882">I understand him to say that the FPC has exclusive jurisdiction over wholesale rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.143" offset="10660571">And therefore, I presume that he will argue that we cannot attack the wholesale rates as being part of a price squeeze if we go into antitrust court or where this is to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.707" offset="10734759">The State Commission would undoubtedly urge at Parker against Brown applied, certainly if it applies to light bulbs it applies to rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.701" offset="10774779">This Court has before the question whether it applies to light bulbs and how far it goes in the Detroit Edison case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.786" offset="10819082">But suppose we were good to go to court under the antitrust laws, the court would presumably award us damages and continuing damages to the extent of the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.676" offset="10870700">In substance therefore, we would be going the court to get the damages which the FPC could have awarded us because of the differential in rates, the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.576" offset="10918243">That seems a rather roundabout way and unnecessary burden upon the courts to do something which the FPC has the expertise to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.614" offset="10966413">If the suggestion is that we should go to court and we get an order directing the company or the State Commission to raise the rates, then we are doing by interaction precisely what the people who objected to the original draft of Part II in 1935 objected to Judge Hooker from the State Corporation Commission in Virginia in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.014" offset="11048020">Objected that, and it’s in our brief that if that language was not changed, the FPC would have the authority that the ICC had had to come into Virginia or any state and force it to raise the retail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.307" offset="11169228">And that was why I think the reading of the legislative history makes it quite clear that that’s why the amendments that were made were made to prevent the FPC from directly going in and requiring retail rates to be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.871" offset="11235474">Mr. Tuttle’s solution would apparently have us do that indirectly by a court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.692" offset="11254700">There are constitutional problems with that as well but I don’t think we need to get into those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.216" offset="11316767">Some of the amici say we should go to the state agencies and ask them to raise their rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.736" offset="11346860">There is indeed a standing problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.793" offset="11371102">We have tried this for a couple of our clients in other cases and we have been thrown out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.232" offset="11396911">Indeed in the Arkansas case, some of our clients here attempted to intervene for limited purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.829" offset="11423242">And we’re allowed to intervene for very limited purposes, much more limited than what would be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.376" offset="11453440">But the problem is we don’t think that the state agencies are wrong in the way they set rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.646" offset="11490534">The FPC is prepared to allow much higher rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.968" offset="11503804">They’re prepared to do it on a different basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.086" offset="11516343">And the State Commission said he’s believed that they have a responsibility to their citizens as well and to other citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.948" offset="11555736">And we don’t believe it’s our responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.874" offset="11563468">We don’t believe it’s right to go to court and say, Arkansas Power and Light raise your retail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.033" offset="11596069">We have no problem with the way the Arkansas Public Service Commission is setting those rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.936" offset="11611742">Our problem is with the FPC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.247" offset="11632953">The FPC suggests that there is a magic to the way it sets wholesale rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.936" offset="11659703">But that’s easily answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.354" offset="11669316">If there were as there are in some instances two wholesale rates, one by Arkansas Power and Light to an affiliate which then sold at retail and the area where it sells and one to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.965" offset="11731801">The FPC would have no problem with saying lower the higher rate or raise them both and the discrimination and then set a just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.890" offset="11779553">But end the discrimination first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.070" offset="11796271">In this case, they say, well, somehow or another, there is a magic to the way we set a just and reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.268" offset="11828976">And we’ll get to it five or six years down the road and you’ll then be saved, maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.708" offset="11854785">But we won’t do anything about the discrimination.</text>
