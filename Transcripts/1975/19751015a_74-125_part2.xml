            <label>Mr. J. Gordon Cook</label>
            <text syncTime="12.701" offset="154154">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.664" offset="158020">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.841" offset="170663">If I may spend just a minute briefly revealing what I said yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.719" offset="194174">My position yesterday was that the Lassen case is not opposite to my client's position and I seize upon wording in the Lassen case that refers to general powers of sale and lease given to the state by the Act and my proposition is that it was for the state to decide whether it should or should not insert a Condemnation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.299" offset="300544">I point out that there was no evidence below that would indicate that the state acted unreasonably in inserting or not inserting a Condemnation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.771" offset="350386">I distinguish the Fuller case, which I mention is a companion case almost, because there the Taylor Act specifically said that nothing shall “create any right, title, interest or state into the lands.”</text>
            <text syncTime="78.827" offset="418618">Meaning therefore, upon condemnation by the Federal Government, it would not have to pay for any right to the fee lands because of any increase in value, because of the right to use a Taylor grazing lands, but there is no such wording in the Enabling Act that would prohibit Arizona by not inserting a Condemnation Clause from creating a right to the lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.957" offset="511196">I realize that Lassen says, “We must nevertheless conclude that the purposes of Congress require that the Act's designated beneficiaries, derive the full benefit of the grant,” but there is no testimony below that they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.712" offset="582144">There is no testimony below that one way or the other, it was not necessary to insert a Condemnation Clause in order to lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.362" offset="624776">I remind you of the fact that statistics show that there is a lot of remote land in Arizona, that there is a lot of Federal land in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.387" offset="668871">Of the 72 million acres of land in Arizona and I get this from the 61st Annual Report of the Arizona Land Department, of the 72 million plus acres, only 11,500,000 are privately owned, 51 million is federally owned, 9 million plus is owned by the state and in these remote areas, as the testimony show, often there is not a lot of fee ownership land.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.583" offset="781615">Now, by the Fuller case you have already said that upon condemnation the Taylor Grazing increment in value is not compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.580" offset="825605">So I say and I ask you to realize that if you say that there is no compensation allowed for the lessee's interest, then a very valuable tool on financing maybe lost and I am backed up by that by the amici curiae brief of different banks and by the fact that New Mexico takes a position by amici curiae brief in opposition to that of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.152" offset="927901">I would turn then to analyzation of the lease because the Court of Appeals below, when it decided that there was no property right created in Alamo, said it was not then necessary to discuss the lease provisions, it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.684" offset="994043">There is nothing in the lease that prevents my client’s position.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.767" offset="1010343">My opponent seizes upon the word “vested” but that simply means that the right of the lessee is subject to no contingencies and we discussed yesterday of the fact that here, in the event there is reclassification, the lessee could be ousted from possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.426" offset="1080979">Now, I have cited a myriad of cases in my briefs, particularly in the reply brief on pages 5 and 11 that I think are without contradiction that say that just because the landlord could terminate the lease, it does not mean that the tenant does not have a compensable interest upon condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.103" offset="1151718">That is merely an evidentiary factor to be considered and there is no law that decides to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.518" offset="1325380">It was merely left open in the Ninth Circuit because the Ninth Circuit said that since it interpreted the Enabling Act and not create a property right, there was therefore, no Fifth Amendment compensation to my clients and they therefore, did not have to pass upon the question of whether the lease precluded the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.891" offset="1390895">But I submit that Judge Craig did because the lease came in evidence and we argued that below.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.701" offset="10538141">If we are going to nearly reproduce the result to the auction as Lassen prescribes that we must do if we are going to have sales other than at public auction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.909" offset="10602925">In order for this Court to not establish a dual standard in the distribution of state funds, I think the only solution is to determine that just as in a sale of public lands through the auction procedures that the state and the trust must derive the full benefit of the sale of the lands and I think to conclude that a lessee has a compensable interest in, only in a condemnation case and not at under any other circumstance, really does not make a uniform consistent application in the trust and does not constitute, what I would say, results in the trust being compensated for the full appraised value of land taken out of the trust.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Gordon Cook</label>
            <text syncTime="2680.984" offset="10827264">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.240" offset="10828309">I will try to be very brief and I think I can answer some of the questions that have been posed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.799" offset="10850565">The Lassen decision below refers to an Arizona Supreme Court decision that compares the Enabling Act, Section 28 with Arizona’s constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.780" offset="10890481">The citation is 181 Pacific Second 336 and it shows that they are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.356" offset="10916708">There are a couple of minor distinctions that are not at issue herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.427" offset="10933008">There is an excellent annotation that appears at 1 ALR 3rd that is entitled condemnation property state law and that particular annotation refers to a decision of your Court in the Polson case which provides that in determining a Fifth Amendment question, you can interpret the state law and that appears in the annotation on page 481.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.600" offset="11101759">Arizona has consistently, by its statutes interpreted this right as being a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.774" offset="11130389">In fact Arizona in the statute referred to in both my briefs, the reply at page 10 also in a situation where there was a condemnation for the purpose of parks, specifically said, the lessee’s right was “a property right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.487" offset="11193292">I believe one of the Justices asked whether or not there were any decisions of Enabling Acts of other states, there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.181" offset="11224012">There is New Mexico, in the Chavez case cited in my briefs, specifically interpreted the renewal rights under school trust lands to be compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.182" offset="11260061">The same thing as true in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.400" offset="11268943">You can find that in pages 6 to 10 of my reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.322" offset="11284616">Wyoming is interpreted as a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.936" offset="11295065">That has been a consistent interpretation in the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.102" offset="11307708">On pages 5 and 11 of my reply brief, I set forth a myriad of cases that say, that although the landlord could terminate the lease, the lessee is still has a compensable property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.119" offset="11355774">I would like to mention the questions relative to the appraisal of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.409" offset="11384926">On page 21 of the appendix under the Section, highest and best use, you can see from reading that that the appraiser of the United States is referring to the highest and best use as grazing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.039" offset="11439470">Later on he speculates about residential, but that is what he says as a highest and best use under that particular heading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.479" offset="11469250">And may I say the whole trial below was on one issue and that was when would the property be reclassified for residential purposes and it was determined that Alamo would stand till that happen and that was by Judge Craig, determined to be for 26 years, that is what it was all about below and there was no opposition to that particular testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.975" offset="11583248">And I close by saying in response to some of the questions of Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.307" offset="11604564">There is nothing except left to speculation as to whether or not, without -- with the Condemnation Clause, you would loose a source of lessees and I say the question is real because that is why New Mexico supported the petition and that is also why the banks supported the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.131" offset="11683872">And even though you cannot have free bidding because the state does set the lease price, we do not what will happen as to whether or not you will loose the source of lessees and I think that is why throughout the years in the west, none of these states have tried to interpret and insert a Condemnation Clause in release.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.368" offset="11756805">Thank you.</text>
