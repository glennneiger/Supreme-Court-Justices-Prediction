            <text syncTime="20.049" offset="153820">The Union Electric case is here on writ of certiorari in the Court of Appeals with the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.009" offset="181614">The petition is the operator of an emission source regulated by state implementation plan under the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.631" offset="216200">And a petition for review of the state plan filed in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.203" offset="234486">Petitioner claimed that it was economically and technologically impossible for him to comply with the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.034" offset="261758">The Court of Appeals said the petitioner could not raise such a claim and we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.686" offset="284327">The 1970 amendments to the Clean Air Act were a drastic remedy, to what was perceived as a serious and otherwise uncheckable problem of air pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.219" offset="326541">As the legislative history of the amendments conclusively demonstrates, Congress made the considered judgment that a certain level of clean air was necessary for the health and well being of the people and it determined to force technology to achieve that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.514" offset="391638">Thus the amendments require regulated emission sources to meet certain air quality standards with those specific period of time whether compliance of those standards seemed possible or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.315" offset="438868">For the reasons stated in opinion filed with the clerk today, we find that this game, there is no room for petitioner to claim the compliances  technologically or economically impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.054" offset="485888">According to the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.539" offset="499785">Mr. Justice Powell filed a concurring opinion and Mr. Chief Justice joined.</text>
