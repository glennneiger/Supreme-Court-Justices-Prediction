            <text syncTime="111.687" offset="550063">Of course, the Pennsylvania in 1971 passed the Domestic Income Tax and, in response to that, New Jersey passed its Commuter’s Tax known as the Transportation Benefits Tax Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.235" offset="600218">It taxes both Pennsylvania citizens who cross over to New Jersey and New Jersey citizens who cross to Pennsylvania, but immediately exempts those persons and, in fact, even does not require the filing of a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.577" offset="649642">The issue, therefore, is whether or not that statute falls squarely within the holding in Austin, and we think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.157" offset="679944">The issue before the court raised by New Jersey’s motion, our position, is whether Pennsylvania, as a state, has standing to sue first for declaration that that statute is unconstitutional and the injunctive relief which should follow and, the second issue, whether or not has standing to seek the retroactive application of such determination and an accounting and repayment for the funds collected by New Jersey.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.513" offset="953393">In Austin, the challenge was by individual taxpayers claiming violation of privileges and immunity.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Silver</label>
            <text syncTime="218.240" offset="976277">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we assert several issues standing as to our first count.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.799" offset="998533">The first issue and I think the most important one is that, perhaps with the exception of the Commerce Clause, what keeps the nation together is the Privileges and the Immunities Clause, and it is our contention that Pennsylvania as a state suffers a trespass against it when its citizens’ privileges and immunities are violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.313" offset="1076587">The support for that proposition, first, I think is in Ward v. Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.762" offset="1094350">Also, in footnote 5, Mr. Justice Marshall’s opinion in Austin where James Madison requested information on what is to prevent the trespassers of one state against another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.622" offset="1141789">The answer was the Privileges and Immunities Clause, that Pennsylvania has been independently harmed by the fact that there is a violation of the privileges and immunities of its citizens and I might add, in support of that proposition, this Court’s opinion in Travers v. Towne and Yale Manufacturing Company, there, there was a corporation whose act was nothing more than withholding the money of its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.531" offset="1265400">This Court permitted that corporation to assert the privileges and immunities of its employees.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="298.501" offset="1297269">It was acting as a withholder and as a conduit of the money at least.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Silver</label>
            <text syncTime="302.828" offset="1314615">Yes, but it did not allege that its privilege and immunities were being violated but that its employees’ privileges and immunities were violated, and their standing to raise that was sustained by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.455" offset="1357142">I would add also, I think the answer is contained in Mr. Justice Marshall’s opinion at 6-62 in which it is said that the issue that privileges and immunities, in terms of maintaining peace between the states that the constitution seeks to establish is such an important issue that it has a high degree of judicial inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.061" offset="1443555">That is language that I believe to be the converse in terms of the required level of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.217" offset="1468215">Now, Pennsylvania also asserts its interest parens patriae to represent its citizens, stand in the shoes of its citizens to seek a declaration that a statute of a sister state is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.324" offset="1544597">I think so, Your Honor, because in Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, West Virginia passed a statute which said that before you export natural gas to any other state, you must ensure that the demands of West Virginia are first satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.982" offset="1623278">Pennsylvania, by its self as well as in behalf of its citizens’ parens patriae together with Ohio, commenced original actions in this Court seeking a declaration that the statute was a violation of the Commerce Clause and this Court permitted Pennsylvania in that case to seek a declaration that a sister state statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.681" offset="1706033">The question that you raise in addition to the one that I think I have tried to answer is the other aspect and that is the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.788" offset="1730484">The Eleventh Amendment only precludes, as I understand it, money judgments as against a sister state except the area under the exceptions of ex parte Young but that only--</text>

            <text syncTime="638.921" offset="2658980">This Court in a long line of opinions has said that there are really two aspects to any tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.363" offset="2780816">Going back to the issue of the original jurisdiction of this Court in terms of the retroactive relief that we seek, the Pennsylvania gave a tax credit, it does give a tax credit, to all of its citizens who pay income tax to another state, I might add that every state which surrounds Pennsylvania, has domestic income tax with the exception of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.067" offset="2899620">This is a tax credit, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="800.156" offset="3303891">That is the very type of conduct that the Privileges and Immunities Clause was designed to prohibit retaliatory actions by one state against another state and, in fact, I would even suggest there is a possibility that if we passed such a tax exemption exempting only New Jersey citizens, that Pennsylvania would also be in violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, if not of the Equal Protection Clause by singling out New Jersey but until New Jersey statute is declared unconstitutional, Pennsylvania has of course the right to give such a tax credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.301" offset="3432518">That it may be harmed as a consequence does give it the right to complain in a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.824" offset="3454566">Now, the reasons for the retroactive application are set forth in our brief, but New Jersey was unnoticed certainly at the time of the passage of the Act, certainly at the time of the filing of the Austin case, and certainly at the time, this Court issued its Austin decision and it is a constitutional tort feaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.861" offset="3538785">It should not be permitted to maintain the benefit that it has achieved by reason of its unconstitutional acts and, therefore, we would assert that it is not only within the power but the proper power of this Court to say to New Jersey “you have unconstitutionally collected a tax and you may not be able to keep that tax.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.378" offset="4444816">We certainly want, first, the prospective relief to enjoin the statute, and I just might add that if this court would grant leave at least as to what I consider to be the easier issue as to the declaratory and injunctive relief, we would file then a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin possible retroactive question after January 1 of this year because, at that time, again the returns will start being filed for the tax year of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.778" offset="4558396">In order to avoid a much more difficult collection problem that already exists, I would file at that time a motion for preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.088" offset="4591624">Now, I think the question, although I really have not addressed that Mr. Justice Blackmun in those terms in your request that I address myself to Massachusetts v. Missouri has really been answered in the dialog between Mr. Justice Rehnquist, Mr. Justice White, and myself in that the question in Massachusetts v. Missouri was the mutual exclusiveness of the claims and what I think we have been talking about is whether or not the claims of the taxpayers and the claims of Pennsylvania are mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.276" offset="4716385">We claim that they are, that since the moneys were diverted from the Treasury of Pennsylvania and, in fact, if the court is going to have retroactive relief in terms that the Pennsylvania taxpayers just the administrative problem of returning it to 60,000 Pennsylvania taxpayers over a period of three years, would be much easier to serve than Pennsylvania’s attempt to collect that money, if the money went to the pocket from which it was taken, and that is Pennsylvania Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.558" offset="4825576">And really, what the issue involved in Massachusetts v. Missouri is an issue relating to mutual exclusiveness, and what I think the Court’s decision in that case was that the issue between the states could not be resolved by this Court because both Courts, although could come up with inconsistent judgments, those inconsistent judgments were not necessarily mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.517" offset="4937380">The only other question that is raised, I believe, by New Jersey’s brief that I wish to deal with is the issue as to whether or not this Court can give a money judgment, and I think that it has in the case of Virginia v. West Virginia which is not cited in our brief but it is at 38-202 and has ordered the judicial sale for the purpose of satisfying a possible judgment in South Dakota v. North Carolina at 192-286.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.362" offset="5040721">Also, I think this Court has always been troubled I believe over its ability to execute judgments in original actions and I think, I would refer to this Court’s opinion in Griffin v. Thompson which Mr. Justice Daniels said at 43 US 244 that there is an inherent power in every Court to exercise and execute upon its judgments and, frankly, I think he says without this power, Courts would be wholly impotent and useless and that this Court has the power under its original jurisdiction to establish whatever necessary common law requirements are to effectuate the judgment, and I think the assertion that there is an ability to effectuate this Court’s judgment is a red herring case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.607" offset="5205710">Let us get the judgment I think and then worry about how to execute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.044" offset="5215532">I think there is an argument that New Jersey’s public officials who have to obey the constitutional laws of the United States would have to, under their oath, obey the judgment of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.049" offset="5275509">I would reserve any remaining time for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen Skillman</label>
            <text syncTime="1300.065" offset="5303617">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.358" offset="5316783">This matter is before the Court on a motion for leave to file an original action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.555" offset="5337576">The sole issue properly before the Court, therefore, is whether the Court has original jurisdiction over this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.742" offset="5374252">It is the position of New Jersey briefly stated that this matter does not lie within the original jurisdiction of the Court because the State of Pennsylvania has no cause of action against New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.532" offset="5421482">Its brief, in support of the motion for leave to file, relies exclusively upon the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Article 4 Section 2 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.221" offset="5468189">It is clear that these clauses offer protection only to individuals, in this case individual taxpayers, and not the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.982" offset="5507268">If anyone’s rights under these clauses have been violated, it is the Pennsylvania residents who have paid the New Jersey commuter benefits tax and not the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania nor may the Commonwealth pursue this matter on behalf of its citizens as parens patriae.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.621" offset="5601831">It has been suggested by counsel for Pennsylvania that if there has been some type of violation of the constitutional rights of the citizens of the Pennsylvania that there has, therefore, been a trespass of some sort upon the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.902" offset="5666928">No cases are cited for this proposition and its consequences would be rather breathtaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.425" offset="5693051">This court has had hundreds upon hundreds of interstate tax cases coming forth through the years not only under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, but under the Equal Protection Clause and of course, most frequently in the business context, under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.459" offset="5749162">If this case comes within the original jurisdiction of the Court because there has been a violation of the constitutional rights of the citizens of Pennsylvania and, therefore, a trespass upon the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, it would be difficult to see how all the rest of the interstate tax cases involving not just the Privileges and Immunities Clause but also the Protection Clause and Commerce Clause would not also come within the Court’s original jurisdiction and greatly expand that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.176" offset="5879983">Now, there also is a significant Eleventh Amendment aspect to the attempt by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to bring this case as an original action insofar as they seek a judgment for money damages against the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.073" offset="5951558">It is clear that, under the Eleventh Amendment, the individual Pennsylvania taxpayers could not bring suit in Federal District Court for the collection of any retroactive tax benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.885" offset="6022820">It, therefore, should be equally clear that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania cannot dress this matter up as an original action and circumvent the bar of the Eleventh Amendment and seek a money judgment against the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.134" offset="6095859">It was essentially for these reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.128" offset="6107875">Your brother cited to us a couple of cases which he says are cases of original jurisdiction of this Court I think, one in 238 US and another in 192 US, in which he says the Court has entered money judgments against the state, but I suppose the plaintiff in that case was the state suing on its own behalf and not on behalf of its citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.003" offset="6199304">The main precedent on that particular point is the case of Virginia v. West Virginia where, at the time, the State of West Virginia was established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.020" offset="6231382">There was an allocation between the two states of the then existing bonded indebtedness of the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.163" offset="6255937">Clearly, a cause of action of the State of Virginia and the Court did recognize that a money judgment might be entered under those extraordinary circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1550.855" offset="6306719">I believe that is the latter of the two cases in 238.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.486" offset="6329289">The other case is the South Dakota v. North Carolina case where I believe over a sharp dissent, South Dakota was permitted to take an assignment by way of gift of a bonded indebtedness between certain of its citizens and the State of North Carolina and to sue under that but, again, it was at the point that the completed gift was made it was an obligation between the state and the other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.627" offset="6441825">Here, on the other hand, it is clear that the obligation, if any, is an obligation that would run between the taxpayers of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.019" offset="6495428">So, that extraordinary form of relief is not available here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.134" offset="6523849">New Jersey relies very heavily, as indicated in its brief, upon Massachusetts v. Missouri where the Court found that the interstate tax conflict involved there did not fall within its original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.063" offset="6591558">The Court specifically held that no justiciable controversy was presented by Massachusetts’ contention that the Missouri Taxing Authorities had improperly refused to exempt the assets of the estate of a Massachusetts domiciliary from the Missouri taxes, a very similar situation to the one we have here where the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is claiming that notwithstanding the credit provisions of its own laws that the State of New Jersey should not have enacted a statute which would bring those credit provisions in to play.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.146" offset="6795940">Here, I take it, Pennsylvania takes the position that New Jersey cannot consistently with the constitution impose this tax on citizens of Pennsylvania.</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.030" offset="6915477">Here, we have not constitutional bar against double taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.472" offset="6929165">We have an argument that there may be a violation of the Privileges and Immunities clause by virtue of the imposition of New Jersey’s tax because of the particular tax structure of New Jersey but no inherent or intrinsic constitutional bar against double taxation, and I think that that is the main response to it.</text>

Florida where they had entertained an original action in a case involving five different states seeking to tax the estate of a single dissident, and I think that the mutual exclusivity also was meant to deal with that problem and to try and limit the parameters of that rather unusual case which Justice Frankfurter in dissenting had expressed fear might greatly expand the number of original actions being brought before the --</text>

            <text syncTime="1788.405" offset="7256949">But nevertheless, the claim here is that the constitution prevents New Jersey from imposing the tax in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen Skillman</label>
            <text syncTime="1795.580" offset="7285684">That is certainly Pennsylvania’s claim, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.122" offset="7299790">It is true and recognized that the constitutional claims which Pennsylvania seeks to advance on behalf of its citizens would, if sustained by this Court, result in an increase in the tax revenues of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania but this would be equally true in almost any case in which a state taxation provision were declared invalid because credits and deductions for taxes paid to other taxing authorities are so common place in the taxing schemes of all states that this would be a very frequently consequence of any declaration of unconstitutionality of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.558" offset="7485573">So, again, if this is a foundation for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania proceeding directly against the State of New Jersey, the same jurisdictional principle would extend to the great majority of interstate tax disputes that come before the Court, that have come before the Court, through the years and with a few unusual exceptions of Massachusetts v. Missouri and Texas v. Florida have been brought by the individual taxpayers who claim that their individual constitutional rights had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.551" offset="7625485">Now, while Pennsylvania’s proposed complaint only mentions the Equal Protection and Privileges and Immunities Clauses, their supporting brief refers to the water diversion and escheat cases where the Court has fashioned what is called a federal common law in its role as arbitrar of interstate disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.195" offset="7708136">The short answer to Pennsylvania’s reliance upon those cases, I think I have already given, and that is that neither Austin v. New Hampshire nor any other state tax case with a possible exception of Texas v. Florida has been decided on that type of a basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.653" offset="7773965">However, if the Court were to conclude that these cases were the appropriate jurisdictional framework for resolving this matter, we would ask that the mater on its merits also be treated as an interstate dispute to be resolved in accordance with principles of federal common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.599" offset="7921713">I would like to comment briefly if I may upon the presentation and argument of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.813" offset="7950553">I think that the most salient feature of that presentation is that the Commonwealth relies upon the water diversion, escheat cases and other cases in which the Court has fashioned a general federal common law in its role as arbitrar between the states in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.207" offset="8040100">However, having established, as they conceive it, the jurisdiction of the Court under these cases they then abandon them and on the merits instead of relying upon principles comparable to those in the water diversion cases or asking the Court to fashion principles similar to those in the water diversion or escheat cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.257" offset="8132365">On the merits, they then turn around and ask the Court to consider this case as one involving denial of constitutional rights of individual taxpayers of the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.678" offset="8178027">The State of New Jersey would have no objection to the Court entertaining under its original jurisdiction, this matter under principles comparable to those that have been fashioned in the water diversion or escheat case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.820" offset="8238631">It would require rewriting of a good deal of constitutional history since these cases have previously, with one or two exceptions, been considered under the Privileges and Immunities and Equal Protection and Commerce Clause as applicable to taxpayers, but New Jersey would have no objection to this area of interstate tax disputes being reconsidered under those principles and under the original jurisdiction of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2094.818" offset="8482615">If they are asking the Court to entertain original jurisdiction under the analogy of these other cases, then we would ask that the merits also be considered under the analogy of those cases and we would urge that if the case were so considered, and I am stating this in a hypothetical really Justices, that if the case were considered, the State of New Jersey would have a very persuasive case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.460" offset="8581149">There is a tremendous outflow of money from New Jersey residents to the States of New York and Pennsylvania in a very small inflow of money under the statutes that are under the statute that is involved in this case and in the comparable statute that is applicable to the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.869" offset="9874837">I suppose you could say there is one thing it would not do, and that is to tax everybody or would a possibility?</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.295" offset="9904512">You would just quit exempting New Jersey-ites so that Pennsylvania would then give the credit?</text>

            <text syncTime="2458.002" offset="9935336">New Jersey has been striving for the enactment of an income tax for a long time, so it would be highly speculative as to what the consequence of that would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.606" offset="9969713">As to Pennsylvania’s granting of the credit in this situation, and I do not want to go into the merits further than I really should but I should just note, that this was not something that New Jersey conjured up in the middle of night and did without consultation with Pennsylvania before this tax was enacted, and it was enacted right on the same time that Pennsylvania enacted its income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.939" offset="10055082">There were discussions in a conference between the governors of the respective states, their personal counsel, and the attorney generals of those states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.251" offset="10084339">So this is not, at least it was not initially, the type of conflict or attempt by the State of New Jersey to raid Pennsylvania tax revenues that might have been portrayed and, again, that would be another area that factually would have to be explored if the court were to reject our contention that Pennsylvania does not have standing to pursue this matter on behalf of its taxpayers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Silver</label>
            <text syncTime="2525.779" offset="10206383">Your Honor, just very briefly I, during lunch or recess, would like to further amplify my answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s remark or questions to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.347" offset="10240656">There is no doubt that New Jersey did consult with Pennsylvania and extended certain courtesies, but I think this Court should know that, first of all, their tax is almost a mirror image of ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.651" offset="10285900">In fact, some of our embarrassment, the same typographical and grammatical errors that appear on our Act also appears in New Jersey’s Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.269" offset="10316411">I think it is essential and important to know that every single time, we have changed the rate, which has only been two times that initially it was 2.3% and New Jersey had it at 2.3% and when we changed it to 2% New Jersey immediately changed theirs too and that I think, in answer to your question Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the target here has been Pennsylvania and not its citizens and truly, in support of this position, I would rely on Mr. Justice Blackmun’s dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.699" offset="10422154">One of the reasons, one might ask is why has not a citizen attacked it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.686" offset="10434066">Because, if he attacks the statute and he is successful, he pays the same amount of money in Pennsylvania by reason of what New Jersey has done in terms of retaliation and it is Pennsylvania’s Treasury that is being harmed by this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.200" offset="10488087">Are you being animus against Pennsylvania as a sovereign entity rather than just to decide to collect as much money as possible?</text>

          <turn speaker="lawrence_silver" startTime="2603.289" stopTime="2661.388">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence Silver</label>
            <text syncTime="2603.289" offset="10516509">Well, Your Honor, this statute does not tax all non-residents and that is a point that I think should be emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.129" offset="10539810">This tax statute says the Commissioner of Transportation shall select a border state which has a critical transportation problem and, under this statute, they did not pick Delaware or New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.421" offset="10596966">They only picked Pennsylvania and the rate is the exact same rate as Pennsylvania’s rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.304" offset="10620580">It is, and it was enacted right after our tax was acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.918" offset="10635000">So, it is a rate by New Jersey, a courtesy, I agree but nonetheless a rate upon the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.195" offset="10660078">A courteous rate, but nonetheless an unconstitutional one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.355" offset="10676691">And although we might have gotten into intellectual discussions about parens patriae, etcetera, the primary argument which I had in my brief and relied on it on perhaps more academic arguments but I think arguments that are meritorious, but I think the easier argument is Pennsylvania is the real party harmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Silver</label>
            <text syncTime="2667.696" offset="10774076">Well, it might be, but New Jersey’s Courts could very easily adapt Mr. Justice Blackmun’s position in his dissent and say “you have no standing because you have no injury, because if you win, you lose because you pay the money.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.683" offset="10822037">This was a constitutional decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.570" offset="10833635">We could always take care of that, could we not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Silver</label>
            <text syncTime="2684.509" offset="10841367">Yes, Your Honor, in three years or so when the retroactive relief we would be seeking would be many more millions of dollars than it is already, and I might add, we have waited three years and I think the answer is really contained in Mr. Justice Brennan’s statement, there has been substantial efforts to get New Jersey to pass an income tax, and I concede that if they tax their citizens the same way they are taxing our citizens, we would not have the same constitutional underpinnings for this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.356" offset="10940737">It became abundantly clear in July, Mr. Justice Brennan, that New Jersey was not going to pass an income tax, and in August we filed our action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.030" offset="10967487">And, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if I just may say one more point, this is not a subtle attempt to utilize the original jurisdiction of this Court to vindicate what is essentially a private right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.967" offset="11011163">This is not an attempt like in New Hampshire v. Louisiana to take an assignment of bonds but it is an attempt to rectify and to protect Pennsylvania’s fisc.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.190" offset="11044078">It is a direct interference with Pennsylvania’s interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.509" offset="11061318">Now, to do that, they must assert its unconstitutionality and, upon that, must be the infringement to its citizens or the infringement, as I have suggested, to itself.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2749.700" offset="11102069">But, of course, Pennsylvania has had within its own power at all times to prevent that injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.240" offset="11120251">How about the old common law maxim of volenti non fit injuria that if you have it within your own power to prevent the harm, you cannot come to court and complain about it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_silver" startTime="2766.724" stopTime="2900.460">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence Silver</label>
            <text syncTime="2766.724" offset="11170197">I think that the kind of harm we could prevent is in the nature I think of the last clear chance rather than if you have the constitutional power to do something properly and you would exercise that power within your right to avoid the unconstitutional acts of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.131" offset="11251803">I think that New Jersey has relied on what is a floodgates argument, that if the Court opens itself up to this case there will be a floodgate problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.665" offset="11285971">I think not, if you grant all of the relief that we request and even if you grant part of the relief, but I think the issue that we have said is that what must be prevented is for a state to enact a statute which so clearly comes close to constitutional violations, that all we ask is that if a state does violate the constitution that it pay back the money that it has improperly got, that is not a penalty but that is a substantial deterrent that states should and I ensure you will consider in the enactment of legislation in the future, and by granting that relief states will steer clear of the kind of constitutional violations that have been suffered in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.704" offset="11458171">I would just respond to one matter that came up in argument before lunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.070" offset="11475620">I think that the matter that their brief in opposition can be treated as a motion to dismiss and I think that the arguments can be resolved on the merits at the present posture on the legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.145" offset="11523895">Certainly, regardless of what New Jersey would do in terms of an answer, we would file a motion for file for summary judgment or an alternative judgment on the pleadings of waiting their answer, but the issue as to the constitutionality of a tax is a legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.494" offset="11573318">This Court can look at the statutes without any reference to any facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.849" offset="11590664">The statue is clearly there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.976" offset="11595261">The only argument I just would, not reiterate but just, remind that I made is the fact that New Jersey may use this tax for transportation purposes does, if the taking is wrongful to begin with, the use does not save it even if the use were as a donation to the fisc of Pennsylvania, as meritorious as Pennsylvania would find that to be, we would still say that such a meritorious use, a donation to our Treasury would not save the unconstitutional taking.</text>
