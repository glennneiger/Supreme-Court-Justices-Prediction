            <label>Mr. James M. Penny, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="44.726" offset="282239">Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.393" offset="296867">This case is before you on writ of certiorari to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and concerns the propriety of the entry of mandatory injunctive relief where the District Court expressly found that the defendants had not violated plaintiff’s constitutional rights, where there was no continuing course of conduct to enjoin, and where there was an adequate remedy of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.959" offset="399163">This case is before this Court in consolidated form.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.196" offset="416090">It originated as two separate cases filed and tried for the most part in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.029" offset="443466">They were consolidated in 1973 by the District Judge for purposes of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.082" offset="467603">The plaintiffs are essentially the same individual plaintiffs suing on behalf of the class of all Philadelphia citizens and on behalf of the specifically included class of all Philadelphia’s black citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.317" offset="524550">The defendants also are essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.344" offset="536671">They are the Mayor, the Police Commissioner, and the Managing Director of Philadelphia and in addition, a Police Captain.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.745" offset="574288">The class plaintiffs averred that the defendants, these defendant city officials, had engaged upon a course of conduct of the basest, lowest form of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.168" offset="619950">The averment was that these city officials had made a conscious decision to deprive a segment of Philadelphia’s society of their basic constitutional freedoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.674" offset="666030">It was averred that genocide was the goal that now Mayor Rizzo had actually planned and was attempting to carry out the extermination of Philadelphia’s black community.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.003" offset="719319">And the vehicle for carrying out this plan was supposedly the Philadelphia Police Department, whose officers, it was alleged, were ordered, directed and encouraged to trample upon the constitutional rights of Philadelphia’s citizens, and in particular, Philadelphia’s black citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.307" offset="784521">After 21 days of testimony and after 250 witnesses or approximately 250 witnesses, the Court was forced to conclude that on those allegations plaintiffs utterly failed to prove their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.876" offset="834781">The Court concluded that there was no policy of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.990" offset="851290">There was no policy to violate constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.128" offset="863829">The Court refused to find that any defendant violated any constitutional right of any class plaintiff or any individual plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.204" offset="900087">Additionally, aside from the claims of palpably unconstitutional conduct, plaintiffs in the Goode case averred that the police department’s internal disciplinary procedures for disciplining police officers were, and in their words, inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.070" offset="975528">They averred they had a right and a need to adequate administrative procedures internal to the police department and they demanded a remedy in the form of the adoption of their scheme for their, in their words, adequate internal procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.478" offset="1049194">The Court heard evidence on this issue and decided that the police department’s procedures were indeed inadequate, in terms of disciplining police officers and in terms of receiving citizen complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.692" offset="1106036">Yet both the District Court and the Circuit Court pointed out that there was absolutely no constitutional right in the plaintiffs or in the class plaintiffs to have any improved procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.569" offset="1161625">Essentially the basic question is whether a citizen has a constitutional right enforceable in the Federal Courts for his elected officials and his elected officials’ appointees to act wisely or adequately or efficiently and the Court said, no, they do not have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.939" offset="1235081">But nevertheless the relief was entered and it was entered because the Court heard evidence and made findings regarding separate, individual, independent incidents of police misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.279" offset="1292446">There are approximately 38-40 introduced at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.590" offset="1309687">The Court made findings and it is not entirely clear from the Court’s opinion but it appears that on approximately 25 of these incidents the Court concluded that the police officers involved who are not defendants did act unconstitutionally towards these individual citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.895" offset="1386905">The question --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="321.194" offset="1388054">Well, I noticed in the Judge Fullam’s opinion that in the Goode case he makes specific findings with respect to several of those incidents indeed this was an unconstitutional invasion of the plaintiff’s rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.340" offset="1448658">But in the COPPAR case I do not find those specific findings.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_m_penny_jr" startTime="341.582" stopTime="409.003">
            <label>Mr. James M. Penny, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="341.582" offset="1469661">In the COPPAR case there -- on two of the incidents the Court made a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.215" offset="1488155">I think one; he characterized the police action as an overreaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.956" offset="1511143">That was in the Locke and Perry incident where the finding was that the police officer had a bucket of water thrown on him from the third floor when he was checking out a stolen car and then the police went in and did overreact.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.920" offset="1574986">The other one was the Brown and Smalley incident where, I believe he used the words, the police acted unreasonably, although he did not use the words unconstitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.707" offset="1614170">I am -- when I said approximately 25 incidents I am just giving the best estimate that you could, out of the whole case, find maybe 25 incidents or so where there was conduct which is arguably unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.547" offset="1669445">I do not say that Judge Fullam concluded that in 25 incidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.193" offset="1692119">Judge Fullam’s conclusions as to unconstitutionality, I believe, only go to the six of the incidents in the Goode case.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.003" offset="1739349">Mr. Penny, this Court stayed Judge Fullam’s order, did it not?</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Penny, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="423.669" offset="1797968">No Your Honor, the changes have not been implemented as far as I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.627" offset="1813850">I have not checked on it but I do not believe I would be stating the facts in all candor if I said they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.711" offset="1850108">I do not think there have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.150" offset="1871946">The Court found on the basis of these individual sporadic incidents of conduct, these 25 or so incidents, that they had occurred in the past and that in the future sporadic incidents also would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.081" offset="1939656">And the question is assuming that a remedy can be awarded in the absence of a right and you must remember that the District Court refused to find that the defendants, these defendant city officials, had embarked upon any policy to violate anyone’s constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.021" offset="2007365">But assuming that a remedy is proper, some remedy, the question is whether the Court’s prediction that these individual incidents will occur in the future, on a part of persons, not defendants, presents an inappropriate case for the entry of mandatory injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.574" offset="2077582">Now generally I believe that for a single act or an independent act in violation of one’s constitutional rights by another one acting under color of state law, the typical remedy is damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.192" offset="2132021">However, if a plaintiff establishes a continuing course of conducts, something that is violating his constitutional rights and immediately threatens to violate his constitutional rights in the future, then that plaintiff is entitled to have that conduct stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.553" offset="2193461">But here we have 25 incidents involving 30 police officers strung out over a period of three years where the Court found in that same period that there were 300,000 arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.129" offset="2243825">During that period of time there were approximately 8,000 police officers and there are literally millions of police-citizen interactions which do not amount to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.795" offset="2286457">The plaintiffs not only failed to establish a course of conduct to be enjoined, they failed to establish a pattern of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.211" offset="2316132">We have 25 incidents, each one against -- if properly pleaded against the appropriate defendant may well be eligible for damage relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.337" offset="2356674">You put them together in one case, you still have 30 separate incidents without a single unifying characteristic, other than you have Philadelphia police officers who, I do not think in this case, are acting any differently, and I think as the judge found, the case is typical of most urban police departments that in the course of events, in the course of happenings, unconstitutional actions by police officers do occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.974" offset="2471195">We see this in bad arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.634" offset="2477883">We see this in violation of rights and arrests, it happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.741" offset="2494288">There is nothing mysterious about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="609.480" offset="2541203">I think it is a fair reading of Judge Fullam’s opinion that there were incidents here which violated the constitutional rights of certain persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.531" offset="2577461">However, the perpetrators of that conduct were not defendants, they are individual police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.674" offset="2602016">And there was no thread running through this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.915" offset="2618944">There was no motivation behind it; there was nothing directing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.256" offset="2636289">And that is what separates this case from Allee versus Medrano, from Hague versus the CIO, from Lankford versus Gelston out of the Fourth Circuit which was cited by this Court in Allee, where each of one of those cases involved a policy determination by police or municipal officials that we are going to violate the constitutional rights of certain people.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.115" offset="2731793">We are going to run the farm workers out of the Rio Grand Valley.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.694" offset="2782052">And the Court comes in; it sees that conduct and says, no, you are not, you stop it.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.006" offset="2803368">Here there is nothing to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.447" offset="2813086">The attempt and the hope of this relief is that maybe this future unknown acts that are specific yet we do not know who they are going to be perpetrated by, who the victim is, when they are going to occur, where they are going to occur, how they are going to occur or why they occur or whether they are going to occur except that the Court did find that that was probable that it would occur but it is still guess work.</text>

            <text syncTime="747.692" offset="3094059">But as I understand the word pattern, it is an outgrowth of Title VII where Congress has said, you do not have to show an intentional policy to do anything to discriminate in your employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.000" offset="3139303">All you have to do is show the effect of your existing policies and if the effect of those existing policies is to demonstrate a pattern of conduct statistically then the Courts will do something about it, but there was no similar provision in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.099" offset="3211714">There is no pattern here.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.155" offset="3215894">There is no clear and imminent threat which can should be or can be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.726" offset="3234180">The question as to who, when, where, how, and why are unanswered in the record and they are answerable.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.933" offset="3275035">And the failure -- and this remedy, as I said, only hopes to stop future unknown acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.303" offset="3308472">We do not if it will or not and the reason we do not know is because it does not go to any unconstitutional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.904" offset="3334908">Unless you are prepared to say that inadequate procedures are in themselves unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.434" offset="3357060">Then the remedy and -- the District Court was not prepared to say that, the Circuit Court was not prepared to say that, then the remedy does not enjoin anything that is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.605" offset="3393736">It just substitutes the Court’s judgment on the adequacy of Internal Police Department’s Administrative Procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.971" offset="3423202">Now, plaintiffs concede that it is impossible to frame injunctive relief which would stop the constitutional violation shown in this case, which would stop this future various and independent acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.926" offset="3491016">The reason is not because of anything unique to the police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.690" offset="3506062">It is not unique to this case or to the defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.721" offset="3526229">The reason is because of a fundamental failure in the plaintiff’s case, i.e. they failed to prove the underlying policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.821" offset="3558621">They failed to prove the continuing course of unconstitutional conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.537" offset="5585409">Both the District Court on Page 124-A and the Court of Appeals did use the word pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.168" offset="5623966">As I have said, it found that the number of violations was unacceptably high and with respect to whether they were two years, three years or a shorter period, in the Goode case there were six incidents over 15 months involving just two police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.814" offset="5706513">In the COPPAR case, which was later consolidated with the case in which I was counsel originally, there were 28 incidents over the period of five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.519" offset="5757399">There was also extensive testimony that this was basically a tip of the iceberg problem and that moreover there was a policy by the department to discourage the filing of complaints whereby this information would come to the attention of the senior officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.927" offset="5847052">So that the time period, I submit, is much greatly reduced over what was indicated to the Court earlier and that indeed there was a greater concentration when the temporary restraining order entered by Judge Fullam was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.532" offset="5933465">There were some 16 incidents in the COPPAR case over three-and-a-half month period prior to the entry of that restraining order and there were 12 incidents during the one-and-a-half months in which the restraining order was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.268" offset="6004413">So that the frequency was ascending that the bulk of the evidence in this case is in a much more confined period and as I have said the period of concentration was greater when there was a court order restraining unconstitutional activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.467" offset="12741184">The defendants did not come close to drafting the decree or the Appendix to the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.975" offset="12763231">What happened was on March 14 of 1973, the District Court entered the opinion, a long opinion which is set out in the printed appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.929" offset="12810983">The Court ordered the defendants to submit a program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.138" offset="12831881">Now, the order was unappealable and as the Court recognizes and mentioned several times at various points in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.987" offset="13019231">The Court’s directive is 14 pages long exclusive of any flowcharts and forms, they are not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.088" offset="13051623">That we had -- we submitted something and it was totally unlike what the Court eventually implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.745" offset="13098330">I want to address the right versus remedy issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.526" offset="13113376">This case can be construed in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.668" offset="13126020">Either the Court entered relief because it did determine that the procedures were inadequate and despite what it said about not having a constitutional right to adequacy decided to render them adequate anyhow or the Court decided that the defendants could be held liable despite the Court’s conclusion that they had not violated the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.212" offset="13232181">In either of those two events, the relief, the remedy is thoroughly improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.401" offset="13256945">It is either a remedy without a right or it is a remedy where the Court recognizes it does not have a right to question the wisdom of the executive branches of local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.552" offset="13313474">As for the inadequacy it has been asserted to you that it was only raised in the question of a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.882" offset="13338865">Paragraph 18 of the Goode complaint, inadequacy is alleged, paragraphs 49 to 53, the need for a mandatory injunction in the form of adequate procedures and the right to relief in that form, at Page 21-A, paragraph 2 A and B of their wherefore clause demanding relief, they demand revision on the procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.427" offset="13433011">These procedures and the disciplinary procedures did not arise back in 1973 they have been in this case since the beginning, that was the reason this suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.768" offset="13474389">As far as the analogy with the school desegregation cases in everyone of those cases there is a policy of unconstitutional conduct which is stopped immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.779" offset="13518379">To paraphrase one of this Court’s opinions the relief will halt segregation and we will halt it now, and the same with reapportionment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.727" offset="13558190">There was nothing equivalent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.399" offset="13564877">This decree does not enjoin anything other than what the Court deems is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.421" offset="13584939">We do not know if it is ever going to prevent any unconstitutional conduct because we do not know what the Court is talking about other than something will happen in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.498" offset="13625272">There were some question about the meaning of the Court, where the Court said, it is the policy of the department to discourage the filing of such complaints to avoid or minimize their consequences of proven misconduct and to resist disclosure of the final disposition of such complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.141" offset="13703848">This was brought up to the Court at the beginning of Mr. Hearn’s remarks stating that that is a policy determination by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.787" offset="13738434">I believe, it seems they are to be somewhat irreconcilable, yes, irreconcilable with paragraph three of the findings as you pointed out Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.480" offset="13785246">But if you turn to Page 128-A of the appendix, it is explained that what the Court is talking about there is that policies of the department, meaning the procedures of the department had the result of minimizing and discouraging the complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.087" offset="13851597">Their complaints are handled on a “Chain Of Command basis” and these results in the tendency to minimize and discourage complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.254" offset="13884302">So when the Court said that – talking about the policy to minimize complaints, it was not talking about a willful policy in the part of the department to discourage complaints, but it was talking about was the end result of the duly authorized departmental policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.080" offset="13955669">Finally, Mr. Hearn’s remarks mention that the effected decree is actually very mild, and he says, if we want to change or if we cannot leave with it, well we can go back to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.710" offset="13998092">Well, we should not have to go back to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.264" offset="14012407">A mandatory injunction is always harsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.623" offset="14021811">It is the most extraordinary form of judicial remedy, and in this case, it results in the District Court taking power to itself which the statutes of Pennsylvania place elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.883" offset="14162872">If the complaint alleges criminal conduct, it is elsewhere, and when I say criminal conduct I am not sure if the judge intended to subsume federal criminal conduct which may take this case out of all civil rights violations also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.906" offset="14226924">But wherein a non-frivolous, non-criminal complaint there is a factual dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3610.164" offset="14543946">It is a disciplinary tool and it involves the police officer and his relation to the department.</text>

            <text syncTime="3693.864" offset="14878732">I think it is the best form of discovery available for any civil rights plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.534" offset="14897435">He has to file the complaint and go to the department and get everything he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.106" offset="14915721">It certainly puts the department or the police officer to severe disadvantage in the subsequent civil rights suit for damages. One further point Mr. Chief Justice with your example regarding the assessors, this relief goes far further because with at least the assessors you have a finite number of homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.020" offset="15019375">There is only a certain number of properties to assess and there is only a certain number of problems that could arise, but with the police department there is literally an almost infinite number of chances for something to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.969" offset="15075172">I think the scope of this is far beyond your example of the assessors and this is an extremely, extremely substantial interference with the rights of the police department on the rights of the defendant of city officials here where the Court has refused to find that they have violated anyone’s constitutional rights and repeats that, says that twice during its opinion.</text>
