            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="19.081" offset="179640">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.878" offset="190820">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.283" offset="212449">The question presented is whether employees of the Warren-Trumbull Council for Economic Opportunity in Warren, Ohio are Federal Employees within the meaning of the Federal Tort Claims Act and that is where the United States may be held liable for an automobile accident that occurred on an outing sponsored by the Westlawn Neighborhood Opportunity Center, a program run by Warren-Trumbull.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.922" offset="326970">The District Court granted the United States' motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.525" offset="345360">The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, in our view, incorrectly, in contrary to this Court’s decision and Logue versus the United States and Maryland versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.677" offset="398023">The facts are shown in affidavits, exhibits and depositions that were filed with and against the motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.988" offset="435222">They showed the following: Warren-Trumbull is a nonprofit Ohio Corporation organized at the instance of the City of Warren, Ohio in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.125" offset="499796">The charter of the corporation is reproduced at appendix 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.369" offset="516828">Its purpose is to aid in eliminating poverty in Trumbull County, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.870" offset="542742">To do so, it may receive funds from any source, but its principle funding has always been through grants from the Office of Economic Opportunity.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="119.666" offset="581925">Has that not been -- in fact it is exclusive funding?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_r_sachse" startTime="125.928" stopTime="406.671">
            <label>Mr. Harry R. Sachse</label>
            <text syncTime="125.928" offset="607003">It is difficult to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.840" offset="610660">It has not been its exclusive source of support because 20% of its support has come from donations and kind in the community and there may have been some funding, but so far as we know the only dollar grants that came to the organization were from the OEO.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.745" offset="690281">To receive Federal Funds, Warren-Trumbull had to satisfy the statutory requirements, the Economic Opportunity Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.923" offset="726957">Primary among these were following; First, it had to have a Board of Directors that was composed one-third of locally elected officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.830" offset="770634">One-third of members of the business and professional community that it served and one-third of members of the community of the poor for whose benefit the society was set forth, that is required by 42 U.S.C. 2791 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="185.765" offset="846389">Secondly, no employee of OEO could serve on the Board of Directors or on any committee or administrative body of Warren-Trumbull.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.791" offset="890484">Thirdly, at least 20% of its support had to come from sources other than federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.309" offset="916502">To receive federal funds, it also had to obey statutory requirements and regulations concerning the use of those funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.134" offset="959865">For instance and primarily, the salary ranges that could be paid to its employees had to be in accordance with comparable salaries in the communities and could not exceed $15,000.00 per annum per employee from federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.012" offset="1039382">Employees of the agency were prohibited from participating in unlawful demonstrations, I think that would go without saying, if they are unlawful demonstrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.203" offset="1080133">And thirdly, Warren-Trumbull would have to submit to full auditing by the OEO to see that the funds were expended in accordance of the conditions of the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.298" offset="1136453">The Act also provided, the OEO Act also provided that the OEO could not set national priorities for the use of its grant funds and that the local Board of Directors must have authority over policy of hiring and firing.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.264" offset="1220358">As the deposition of Wendell Verduin, the Chicago Regional Director of OEO made clear and I am quoting from deposition at page 46, “The recruitment selection, the hiring and firing of staff members of the community action agency is done by that Board of Directors under its own policies and procedures.”</text>
            <text syncTime="301.408" offset="1308965">And quoting from deposition of Lester Peterman (ph), a former Executive Director of Warren-Trumbull who had been fired by the Board of Directors, it stated, “I received my directions from my Board which is a governing board not an advisory board.”</text>
            <text syncTime="322.240" offset="1392244">One of the programs of Warren-Trumbull was the Westlawn Neighborhood Opportunity Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.211" offset="1428188">I probably interrupt myself here to say that there is some 865 agencies of this sort funded through OEO throughout the country, but one of the programs of these agencies of Warren-Trumbull was Westlawn Neighborhood Opportunity Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.680" offset="1514079">It was one of a number of Neighborhood Centers that Warren-Trumbull ran, where among other things, teenage children could come after school and play ping-pong or the pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.355" offset="1556711">It also organized dances and outings and it was on one of these outings that the respondent was hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.949" offset="1595058">The outing was to nearby lake whose name I had intended to mention, but I will not because it seems to be too difficult to pronounce.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.184" offset="1632048">It is something in the nature of Cognac.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.410" offset="1652946">Westlawn in the outing, used one van that was purchased with OEO funds grant the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.287" offset="1692443">They also used several cars owned by people in the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.813" offset="2194516">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.041" offset="2207473">The United States moved for a summary judgment on the ground that the persons alleged had been negligent were not employees of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.770" offset="2242373">The District Court in a written opinion on the basis of the affidavits and depositions held that Warren-Trumbull was a contractor with the United States and not a corporation acting as an instrumentality or agency of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.145" offset="2303917">Now on rehearing, an answer to arguments that its activities were controlled by the United States, the District Court held that the Warren-Trumbull “still remains independent locally controlled and constituted non-profit corporation, while the OEO has the power to cut-off federal funds, if the counsel fails to meet Federal standards.”</text>
            <text syncTime="575.123" offset="2403809">They had no power to cut-off funds from other sources which the council is encouraged to utilize.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.647" offset="2429932">On Appeal, and I think this may be the crux of the case, the Court of Appeals held, agreed with this, there were the words of the Court of Appeals, there was no showing that OEO controlled, this is in our petition, an appendix to petition of page 12 (a), there was no showing that OEO controlled or supervised the physical performance of the work of employees of WTCEO, that is Warren-Trumbull, and Westlawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.924" offset="2570993">Moreover, the requirements imposed upon these local agencies by statute and regulations are not concerned with the details of the day-to-day operation of the agencies or the programs which they carry on in the Warren-Trumbull County area, that is the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.052" offset="2647480">The District Court of course agreed, but the Court had said the same thing, the Court went on to say that it did not consider the ties that Warren-Trumbull had with the OEO to be characteristic of an independent contractor and that it thought that in reading the humanitarian purpose of the Tort Claims Act, together with the humanitarian purpose of the OEO, that an accident that occurred to one of the persons that OEO was designed to help and one of the people on the outing should be covered by the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.858" offset="2794706">The Court noted that if a person who was hurt was a stranger that the situation might be handled by traditional principles of contractor-employee relationship and the government might not be liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="705.651" offset="2925945">The Sixth Circuit specifically declined to rule on that, but said there might not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.829" offset="2958650">It based its ruling on a position that we find no support for in Tort Claims Act that whether there is a Tort Claim or not would depend on the nature of the plaintiff, on the status of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.194" offset="3040048">Before I leave the statement of the case, I want to add one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.689" offset="3062095">The respondents and the Court of Appeals used as one of their basis for liability, an affidavit by a man named Sidney Roberts, that two years after this accident, in October of 1972, the accident was in September of 1970, that he was asked by OEO to be the new Chairman of the Board of Warren-Trumbull and that he was appointed directly by the Chicago Office of OEO to that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.964" offset="3235130">This is all there is in the record about it, this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.070" offset="3255610">We have not thought it appropriate to go beyond the record and all we can say on this is that if this man was appointed directly by OEO, it was in a violation of statutes and regulations and we do not see how it could have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.514" offset="3329380">What it seems to us obviously did occur if something of this nature occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1252.505" offset="5113334">The exclusion of contractor with the United States also shows that Congress only intended to make the United States liable for the torts of its employees or most those within its direct control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.532" offset="5185432">There is no reason to assume that under this statutory scheme that Congress intended to make United States responsible for the torts of employees of its grantees who typically would be universities, hospitals, or in later times, community activities that the government chooses to support with grant funding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.189" offset="5420116">In determining, whether employees of a body receiving federal funds be a contractor or some other body, whether those employees are Federal Employees under the Tort Claims Act, the Court has looked at two primary sources and both make great deal of sense, if I may say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.709" offset="5506111">First, the statute that establishes the relationship between the United States and the body at issue, that is in Maryland versus -- they did this both in Maryland and in Logue, but in Maryland versus United States, the Court held that Maryland National Guard was not a federal instrumentality, even though it received its funding from the United States and even though its employees to advance and to perform their duties appropriately, you had to follow detailed federal regulations and held this both as to the military employees and to caretaker employees who are in fact taking care of property admitted to the federal property, but the statute did not set this up as a Federal Agency in time of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.845" offset="5730660">It set up as a state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.839" offset="5742676">The second test the court has looked to is the degree day-by-day control over the activities of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.606" offset="5781755">This is appropriate too because the person who controls the day-by-day activities of employees is the person who can keep accidents from happening and is the person that ought to be responsible if an accident does happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.960" offset="6451117">Now, turning to the statute, the Economic Opportunities Act makes it clear that as I pointed out, I want to move quickly, because I want to save a minute or so for rebuttal if I can, that Federal Government can only lend money to a community agency, if it has Board of Directors on which no federal person can sit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.768" offset="6562399">If the charter is the state charter not a federal charter and if it has local support and so forth, but one of the points that is most persuasive to me is that in the same Act, in setting up the job core, the Congress specially said that the Tort Claims Act would apply to members of the job core.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.987" offset="6675248">Now, it is incredible to me that Congress would have been tended the Tort Claims Act to apply to the job core and felt that it had to say so, but would have felt that the community action program where it sent such pains to make this -- to only allow money to be given to local programs, that there people would be employees of the government without saying a word about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.078" offset="6791649">And also as to the job core, you will notice that there is a tick of which federal employment benefits will apply as to the CAA programs, there is nothing like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1754.121" offset="7119747">In 1964, the administration in Congress declared war on poverty in the United Sates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.879" offset="7158826">The Economic Opportunity Act was at that time enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.971" offset="7175231">The Economic Opportunity Act was an ambitious program which included, among other programs, the community action program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.918" offset="7226954">This was a particularly unique approach that Congress was taking in its war on poverty to try to get to the impoverish people on a local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.305" offset="7292573">They set up guidelines in the statute for the setting up of such a community action program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.689" offset="7330085">They set up also the Office of Economic Opportunity of Government, a federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.189" offset="7360074">This an exhibit in the case, shows some of the suggestions necessary for organizing a community action agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.559" offset="7401556">A Community Action Agency which uniquely, must be uniquely constituted and by the creation of this definition, Congress caused this community action agencies to be set up through out the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.241" offset="7496224">The major basic difference with Community Action Agency and the ordinary charitable agency in its constitution was that it was required to be governed by a board made up of one-third local public officials, one-third representatives of the poor to be served, democratically elected and one-third representatives of the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="2017.366" offset="8172795">This was a local agency set up to act as an agency of Congress, of the Office of Economic Opportunity to carry out the purposes of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2061.744" offset="8350324">Section 2795 of the Economic Opportunity Act, clearly makes a distinction between grantees and contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.568" offset="8401628">The affidavit of Wendell Verduin does not say that this organization was a contractor, but rather that it was a grantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.770" offset="8450425">There are federal regulations, provisions about 80 some pages of them applying to these community action agencies and Code of Federal Regulation Number 1026 distinguishes between contractors and grantees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.519" offset="8857413">This promise was not legally enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.678" offset="8874026">The Code of Federal Regulations provides that the Office of Economic Opportunity could unilaterally and peremptorily terminate assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.076" offset="8931600">They do not save reach the contractor in the contract, terminate assistance to any community action and agency and from that termination, the ultimate appeal was to the director of the agency itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.446" offset="8989070">So that in the ordinary sense of the term there was no contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.616" offset="9005788">Now, the question is, was this a corporation acting primarily as an instrumentality of the Untied States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.700" offset="9042151">The Congress in the Federal Tort Claims Act had various considerations, various language which the considered which would have limited that portion of the Act, corporations acting primarily as instrumentalities of the United States to federal corporations and that sort of thing as suggested by Mr. Sachse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.917" offset="9139013">They decided not to so limit it and left the language unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.955" offset="9159179">Now, in this case, you have a corporation which was enacted for the -- was created for the sole purpose of getting federal funds, and never received a dollar from anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.936" offset="9211006">The only other contributions it received were in-kind services and it might be noted at this point, the deposition of Mrs. Ellen Stanton who was the person employed by the Westlawn Neighborhood Center in-charge of this outing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.593" offset="9281641">In that deposition she said that the driver of the car filed what they call an in-kind slip, in other words, he was acting as an employee of the particular agency at the time of this accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.789" offset="9338484">That really is not an issue here, but the questions of the Court have put it to some extent an issue and Mr. Sachse’s comment that he was not an employee is I believe not correct.</text>
