            <text syncTime="6.503" offset="99573">This case is here on writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.284" offset="122770">It requires us to consider whether the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted the provision of the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.048" offset="161849">That Act provided that the a National Guard Technician was a full-time civilian employee of the National Guard must be a member of the Guard and that a technician who was separated from the Guard, “shall be properly separated from his technician employment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="37.716" offset="224439">The Act also provides that a technician may at anytime be separated from his technician employment for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.666" offset="256308">The respondent was denied re-enlistment in the Guard when his term of enlistment expired and it was then notified that his employment as a technician will be terminated because he was no longer member of the Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.241" offset="302597">The respondent brought this suit to challenge the denial of his request for re-enlistment and the termination of his employment as a technician.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.394" offset="335198">The dispositive question before this Court is whether the Act's provision that a technician may discharged for cause and any application to a case in which the termination of a technician's employment follows is separation on the Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.273" offset="398728">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we hold that it does not, and since the Court of Appeals' order is to the contrary, the judgment of that court is reversed.</text>
