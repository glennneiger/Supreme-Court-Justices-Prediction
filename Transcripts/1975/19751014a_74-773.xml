            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="65.208" offset="364160">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.141" offset="375862">The question that we have in this case is when in a case arising under the National Labor Relations Act do non-employees have the right to picket on private property, in this case, the private property of a modern shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.044" offset="435526">To resolve this question, four decisions of this Court must be reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.468" offset="453185">We have, first of all, the Babcock &amp; Wilcox decision of the Court in 1956 which was a case arising under the National Labor Relations Act and held that non-employees do not have a right to come on private property to engage in organizational activities, except where there are no other reasonable alternatives available.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.296" offset="528522">The second case is a constitutional case, arising under the First Amendment, the Logan Valley case in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.482" offset="557257">In that case, this Court held that a Union may picket on a private property of a shopping center where the center is the functional equivalent of public property, where the picketing is directly related to the use to which the center is being put, and where there are no other reasonable alternatives or opportunities for the pickets to convey their message to the intended audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.451" offset="653074">The third case that has to be reconciled, two cases actually, they were decided at the same day in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.882" offset="682853">First, the Lloyd case which also arose under the First Amendment and not the Labor Act where the Court held that Vietnam protesters could not enter upon the private property of a shopping center to handbill because the handbills were not related to the functions of the center, there were other alternatives available, and the center was not the functional equivalent of public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.263" offset="772401">Finally, decided the same day as Lloyd, there was the Central Hardware versus Labor Board case which arose under the Act and not the constitution, as does this case, in which this Court held that non-employees organizers on the parking lot of a large retail store were subject to the Babcock &amp;Wilcox test that they had no right of entry unless there was an absence of other reasonable alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.026" offset="867382">In this case, we have a situation like Babcock, like Central Hardware that arises under the National Labor Relations Act, not the constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.529" offset="897371">Mr. Cohen, let me ask you, why does this case arise under the National Labor Relations Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="204.075" offset="919627">Your client, the petitioner, did not employ any of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.692" offset="938017">They had no dispute whatever with him.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Cohen</label>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence M. Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="213.739" offset="958289">Because the Union representing the pickets involved filed a charge against Hudgens, the owner of the center and under the Labor Act, any employer can be subject to a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.340" offset="1004682">The Board found that the employer’s conduct, that Hudgens being an employer, not necessarily employer of the pickets, but nevertheless being an employer, had committed a violation of Section 8 (a) (1) by excluding the pickets and that that conduct interfered with the pickets’ right for self-organization guaranteed by Section 7 of the Act, and therefore, it was a violation of the Act.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="244.902" offset="1082945">Would the Board’s reasoning carry over so far that if you did not have a shopping center, but had a simple street and your client had a place on side of the street with a parking lot and another business had a place across the street without a parking lot and the employees of the place across the street wanted to organize in that place, but they could not find any access, so they said your client’s parking lot was the nearest place they could make contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.454" offset="1193077">Now, do you think the Board will say that your client, even though he had no connection whatever with either the employer or the employees that were in the dispute, would have violated the Act?</text>

If you have what the Board says is quasi public property, property that is a functional equivalent of municipal property, and they would put any large shopping center in that category, that according to the Board, you do not have a Section 7 case, you have a constitutional case and if you have a constitutional case, you first look to whether there is a direct relationship involved and, second, you look to whether there is some public site available.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.249" offset="1760248">If there is no public site available and there is a direct relationship, then the pickets have the right to come onto the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.856" offset="1782713">The case turns, in other words, on whether you have a large shopping center such as we have here where you have a small shopping center as the Board have in the Nickels case or a large single-standing store such as Central Hardware, in those cases, the Board says you do not have quasi public property and there is no right to come on unless you can meet the Babcock &amp; Wilcox burden which is essentially our position.</text>

            <text syncTime="445.088" offset="1883650">It is not a question here of whether you have a large center or a small center and in any case, the constitution does not apply.”</text>

            <text syncTime="512.272" offset="2152398">Let me briefly cite the facts in this case, to put it in some perspective of these arguments I have been discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.136" offset="2175804">The facts are generally not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.736" offset="2186253">Scott Hudgens owns and operates what is called the North DeKalb Shopping Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.686" offset="2202031">It is located in suburban residential area of Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.827" offset="2218644">It is a modern shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.773" offset="2222406">It resembles very much the center that this Court discussed in the Tanner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.767" offset="2242364">Entry is from five different entrances.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.730" offset="2254171">Three are side streets, primarily residential streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.495" offset="2273293">Full stop was required before entering the center.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.517" offset="2285413">Two others off of a highway, shortly after a stop light.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.209" offset="2304117">They require a slow turn into the center.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.150" offset="2315924">At each entrance there is a public right of way and there is undisputed testimony in the record that pickets could have picketed on it right away, safely and with their picket signs legible to anyone passing by.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.401" offset="2368901">After you go into the center, it is at page 141 of the Appendix, you cross a large parking lot and then reach an enclosed mall building.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.656" offset="2409965">There is a 10-foot wide sidewalk surrounding the mall building and four entrances into the main mall building from the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.753" offset="2446328">85-90% of the customers of the tenant stores use one of those four entrances.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.682" offset="2466076">There are also some small entrances into individual stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.764" offset="2486347">A considerable investment has been made in the mall to make it attractive to shoppers, the mall building.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.986" offset="2507245">It is carpeted.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.801" offset="2510484">There is piped in music, benches, fountains, drinking fountains, temperature controls, and carousel for children.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.380" offset="2540786">The center has pet regulations, dress regulations, parking regulations, security regulations which it enforces.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.901" offset="2570880">The center is closed at certain times of the day to anybody coming through.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.800" offset="2586553">There is also a long-established and uniformly enforced policy that no one has disputed here, of forbidding any commercial activity on the mall except at least mall booth's kiosk which are at leased out and handled like any other tenant store.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.178" offset="2647993">In fact, the center here involved was before this Court in a case in 1974 called Steffel v. Thompson which involve the center’s exclusion of Vietnam War protesters.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.960" offset="2691147">It came up in a procedural question rather on the merits, but that was the identical center and the identical policy we have here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.011" offset="2719360">The present controversy arose when employees of one of a warehouse owned by one of the tenants of the center, Butler Shoe Co., went on strike in January 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.570" offset="2777560">The tenants were not -- the pickets who then resulted from that strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.657" offset="2801906">The picketing occurred on all the nine Butler locations in the Atlantic area, including the one at the center and at the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.196" offset="2832104">Pickets were not employed by Butler in the center.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.306" offset="2844538">They never sold shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.481" offset="2849240">They had no contact with anyone in the center.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.204" offset="2860107">Their only contact with Butler was the fact they were employed by Butler at another location in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.517" offset="2881319">There was no dispute involving the center.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.627" offset="2889782">The center employees were unorganized and there was no attempt to organize them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.776" offset="2910367">The manager of the shopping center saw the pickets waiting to picket at the Butler store inside the center sitting on one of the benches.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.229" offset="2944222">Before the Butler store opened, he told them they had to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.237" offset="2956238">They left.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.744" offset="2958328">They came back a half hour later, picketed for about 30 minutes with a sign saying “Butler warehouse was on strike.”</text>
            <text syncTime="720.231" offset="2984241">They marched up and down in a corner store where the Butler was located.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.837" offset="3002631">Sometimes they were four abreast, sometimes only two abreast.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.610" offset="3021753">After about half an hour went by, the manager saw them.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.120" offset="3031784">He went up to them, told them to leave, and said if they did not leave they would be arrested on the Georgia Criminal Trespass law.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.298" offset="3060519">The pickets left.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.469" offset="3269185">There was a remand as a result of Central Hardware and Lloyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.908" offset="3282977">The Board heard the case again, found another violation, but on a different theory all together which I will discuss and then the case was in turn appealed to the Fifth Circuit which enforced the Board’s order, but on a third theory all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.063" offset="3331565">So let me turn, if I could, to the different theories that have been advanced to this Court, there are four or five of them, and try and explain where I think the parties differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.968" offset="3367196">First, there are the positions of the Board in its initial decision and which is really advocated here today, and that is the constitutional test.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.415" offset="3400946">What the Board says is that where you have a large shopping center, quasi public property, then Central Hardware and Babcock are irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.283" offset="3440444">That those cases only apply when you have a single-standing store or something that is not a functional equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.881" offset="3466775">And, where you have a large shopping center, then you apply a constitutional test.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.599" offset="3489658">Under the Board’s constitutional test, it differs from the statutory test.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.671" offset="3505959">The constitutional test, as the Board would apply it and say, first, do you have a direct relationship and they would answer that by saying “yes, as the pickets at Butler.”</text>
            <text syncTime="858.247" offset="3536261">And, second, if you do have a direct relationship, then the burden is on the employer, not on the Union as it would be under Babcock, the statutory test, it is on the employer to show that there is no public place, not just reasonable alternative but public place, for the Union to engage in its picket.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.057" offset="3607523">If the employer cannot show that, then the Union has the right to picket on the shopping center, if it is a large quasi public piece of public piece of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.728" offset="3638243">Second, there is the approach, and this is a different approach, of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.748" offset="3650259">As I said, they agree with us that that constitutional test has no bearing here, but they would say that Central Hardware and Babcock apply only to organizational situations that where you are dealing with a picketing situation, a primary picketing situation, then the Union has an absolute right to come onto private property, engage in peaceful primary picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.618" offset="3725805">Now, this position has not been accepted by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.538" offset="3733433">It is rejected in both this case and Nickels case, and it is also reject by the Third Circuit in the Peddie Building case which involved picketing on industrial park.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.510" offset="3769377">There is the position of the Court of Appeals which was really a blend of these two tests and was urged in this Court by the Amicus Chamber of Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.152" offset="3803859">What the Court of Appeals said was that neither the statutory test nor the constitutional test provide the answer and we need something in between.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.440" offset="3833012">So, they agreed except that there ought to be a test of direct relationship and they agreed there ought to be a test of alternatives, but it was not clear whether they were applying the test of alternatives that the Board proposes or the test of alternatives of Babcock.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.808" offset="3882540">In any case, what they said was alternatives were met here because there was no real alternative for picketing inside the mall.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.699" offset="6430106">Now, the Georgia Supreme Court in this case has said that they were preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.706" offset="6578168">So that if you have a conflict we would say “because if you want to avoid a no-law area that may just be the price to pay in order to provide a remedy for a wrong.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.696" offset="6618083">Let me turn, if I could, quickly to the Union’s argument and then to why we think the Babcock test is met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.224" offset="6652146">The right to picket, we submit, even primary picketing, even for peaceful purpose is not an absolute right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.290" offset="6692480">That right has been restricted by the Act, restricted by state law under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.609" offset="6721737">The Union does not have an absolute right to engage in primary picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.071" offset="6735634">It has that right only if it meets other conflicting purposes and competing purposes under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.310" offset="6760502">The Union’s argument that it would have an absolute right to appropriate private property to picket whenever it does would also lead to illogical results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.897" offset="6790909">It means the Union could come on to private property and picket to obtain recognition, to give you an illustration, but it could not come out to that same private property to sign up people to an authorization cards to hold a Board election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.752" offset="6842318">So, what you would have is a case where a Union could proceed to coerce an employer by recognitional picketing as it would have, under the Union’s view, an absolute right to do so, but cannot come on to the property to proceed or paint of Board election which is the preferred course of conduct as this Court said in Lyndon, as this Court said in Gissel Packing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.932" offset="6922984">Taking that point of view, which is what we contend, then we think the question really is has the Union exhausted any other alternatives to communicating its message besides picketing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.664" offset="6965929">That that has got to be approach, like the Babcock &amp; Wilcox.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.503" offset="6977319">Well, those alternatives here, and there was no evidence put on, the Union did not even tried any alternative?</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.306" offset="7000515">The only evidence that was put out by us as to what alternatives that have been used by the shopping center to bring people into the center to conduct business with Butler and the other tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.309" offset="7052551">They consisted of newspaper, radio, television, and all the different techniques that the Board and the Courts of Appeals have applied instead of alternatives to communicating with employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.864" offset="7098736">For example, in Central Hardware when that case was remanded back to the Board, one of the things they looked to had the Union tried -- remand at the Court of Appeals, was had the Union tried newspapers?</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.539" offset="7137502">Had it tried radio and television?</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.451" offset="7145129">To just appeal to those employees who worked at the Central Hardware store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.469" offset="7157146">Well, that is an effective alternative to appeal to the people working at the Central Hardware store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.136" offset="7175849">It is also an effective alternative to reaching the potential customers of the department store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.515" offset="7193404">The department store, in fact has a larger audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.202" offset="7200091">So if it is effective to reach a smaller group, why is it not effective for reaching a larger group?</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.231" offset="7216182">No one is ever answered that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.051" offset="7227467">No one is answering the question of why the Union could not have picketed on the right of way here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.565" offset="7245544">There was question as to the witness at page 141 of the record, could the Union safely picket on the right of way?</text>

            <text syncTime="2227.894" offset="9014870">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.206" offset="9040156">The principle of Babcock as we see it is that in striking a balance between property rights and employee rights for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.109" offset="9103686">Accommodation between the two must be obtained with as little distraction of one as is consistent with the maintenance of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.929" offset="9142974">Now, as applied to the facts of Babcock which involved non-employee Union representatives seeking access to the wholly private property to solicit employees to join the Union, the Court concluded that non-employees could be excluded except where it could be shown that there were no other reasonable means of reaching the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.943" offset="9267108">We submit that the facts of this case are different, and therefore, the accommodation for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act could properly be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.313" offset="9316532">A property is not wholly private, but has assumed, as this Court used the phrase in Central Hardware, to some significant degree, a functional attributes of public property devoted to public use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.968" offset="9387167">Secondly, access is sought by employees and their purpose is not to solicit for Union membership, but to appeal through peaceful picketing to customers of their employer’s retail store to withhold patronage from that store in support of a lawful economic strike that they have against their employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.296" offset="13580447">Now, let us show how those tests are met on the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.453" offset="13605106">Although the underlying contract dispute involved Butler’s warehouse employees, they were engaging in what would normally be privileged as legitimate primary activity in carrying their dispute to their employers in retail store and seeking the aid of their fellow employees working there and of the store’s customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.026" offset="13719418">To be sure, Hudgens’ own title to the property, but as this Court recognized in Steel-workers, the fact that title may reside in a third party does not necessarily impair the legitimacy of otherwise, primary activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.721" offset="14174158">The store picketing was directly related to the use of the shopping center in that the center was designed to attract customers to the stores and the principal purpose of the pickets was to induce customers to withhold their patronage from the Butler Store pending the resolution of the dispute with Butler which Butler, as the employer of most of these employees, the warehouse and the retail stores, was in a position to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.024" offset="14295366">In Lloyd, by contrast, the message on the handbills which protested the Vietnam War was, as the Court pointed out, directed to all members of the public not solely to the patrons of Lloyd Center or any of its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.506" offset="14369345">Respondents could have distributed these handbills on any public street or any public sidewalk, in any public park, or in any public building in the City of Portland.</text>

            <text syncTime="3580.180" offset="14423993">We have a relatedness that would satisfy the Lloyd and the Logan Valley tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.404" offset="14460878">Secondly, picketing at the entrances to the Butler stores afforded the only reasonable means of conveying the picket’s message to their intended audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.059" offset="14519497">As the Court below pointed out, this is not an organizational campaign where it is often times relatively easy to find out who the employees are and appeal to them at their homes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4260.590" offset="17145639">Well, my understanding, Mr. Justice White, of Marsh is that you do not have to show that the message that you are communicating is one which is directly related to the store in front of which you are standing or to the general shopping center area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.502" offset="17217319">I would assume that after Lloyd, if antiwar protesters had appeared in Chickasaw and if Chickasaw was still a company town that they would have had a First Amendment right to distribute their handbills in Chickasaw just the way the Jehovah’s Witness did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.295" offset="17296522">But my understanding of Lloyd is that Lloyd does not overrule Logan Valley, but rather states that the property is not as fully dedicated to the public and that there are First Amendment rights which are recognized, but they are narrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.460" offset="17373113">You have to have speech which is directly related to the functions and purposes of the shopping center and that is why I think that, as I understand the constitutional purposes, there are three different types of property that we are discussing at least functionally and when we discuss them in terms of First Amendment rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="4376.330" offset="17608633">No, Mr. Justice White, I did not mean to imply that Lloyd was inconsistent with Logan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.623" offset="17641756">I meant to imply that there is language in Logan which would have indicated that the question saved in Logan would receive an affirmative answer when it was posed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4400.043" offset="17703510">So now, I was saying to Mr. Justice Stewart, I understand there to be a difference between a company town and a shopping center such as Logan or Lloyd for First Amendment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.044" offset="17763487">The question before us here is whether there are three types of property or more when we are dealing with Section 7 and the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.879" offset="17806850">Our view of the case is that we start by answering the petitioner on his own premise which is that all these types of property are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.641" offset="17861916">The factory in Babcock &amp; Wilcox and the shopping center in this case and in Logan and Central Hardware and Lloyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.412" offset="17912907">And, our view is that Babcock &amp; Wilcox teach us that in a situation in which entree is sought for the purpose of communicating with employees about whether or not they should become organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.358" offset="17968705">The Act is centrally neutral as to where the activity takes place and that the basic point of Babcock &amp; Wilcox is that the property rights are not absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.093" offset="18039653">The National Labor Relations Act enacts its own system which displaces private rights and on occasion, that it has also had been a lesson of Republic Aviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.915" offset="18078942">It is the lesson of such cases as Linn and Letter Carriers versus Austin when you talk about the rights of reputation, and that what was necessary was to draw the fair inferences out of the statute as to when private property would be displaced.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="4525.427" offset="18205061">Yes, we have two basic points that I would make on the alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.208" offset="18236094">First, as I was coming to, here we deal not with organizing activity of the type that was at stake in Babcock &amp; Wilcox, but with picketing in support of an economic strike at the strike employer’s facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4553.547" offset="18317492">Now, we know from what this Court has said and from what Section 7 says that Congress did not merely give a right to picket somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.710" offset="18358138">It had in mind that employers could continue to operate when they were faced with a strike and that Unions would have the countervailing weapon of peaceful non-obstructive picketing at the location in which they would attempt to convince those who were approaching the situs to buy or sell or otherwise contribute to the day-to-day activities of the employer that they should not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.613" offset="18493766">And, this is the balance that the Act strikes and it is our view first of all, Mr. Chief Justice, that that is a right as a matter of law and that, just as this Court --</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="4615.217" offset="18564192">Right, at the business situs, in the words of the Steel-workers case, at the entrance to the strike facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.526" offset="18597420">That is where you have a fair chance to employ this countervailing method, not somewhere far away whereas even Mr. Come acknowledged, if I understood his answer to your question, I believe the message is diffused with somebody going by with his windows rolled up in Atlanta if it is hot or cold because it is air conditioned most probably if it is hot, but so that he has some chance to see the sign, see what the message is, and make a determination whether he is going to shop at Butler’s or he is not going to shop at Butler’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.366" offset="18720718">We think that is what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.681" offset="18733988">That is the classic confrontation and struggle in the economic strike, and we think that the fair reading of cases such as the Steel-workers case is that this particular place is the preferred place at which to carry on that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.618" offset="18801802">And we think from cases like American Ship and from Insurance Agents that it is not for the Board of a Court to say that there may be some other way to do it, that the Union does not need this right, that the employer ought to be safeguarded from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.282" offset="18860421">We think that is the place, and we think the inquiry is, is this the entrance way?</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.530" offset="18877453">We think that that is a functional question.</text>

            <text syncTime="5213.549" offset="20957531">The answer, I think, to the question that was asked to Mr. Gold is that this Court nor the Board nor the Courts of Appeals have never held what Mr. Gold now seeks which is the proposition that a Union has an absolute right to picket at the entrance to the struck plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.988" offset="21027226">If the Union was engaged with secondary activities that Congress cited, they could be relegated to reserve gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5237.594" offset="21053662">There was a contrary actually “no strike” Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.924" offset="21062961">They could be relegated not to have a right to picket at the struck plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.137" offset="21079889">I think the cases that are illustrative and the answer also to some of the hypotheticals asked to Mr. Come are two Board decisions which came out after Lloyd, after Central Hardware, and dealt with the precise type of question we have here in the Nickels case and in the Visceglia (ph) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.007" offset="21139343">In the Nickels case, you have a small shop with five stores.</text>

            <text syncTime="5315.937" offset="21367026">Enforcement denied, and enforcement was denied because, if I could explain the facts in the Nickels case, the Board in applying the picketing situation involving a store or a small shopping center said that, as I understand it in Central Hardware, this is the Administrative Law Judge in his opinion which was adapted by the Board, “The employer may violate Section 81 by denying a Union the right to engage in organizational activities on private property and that encompassed picketing here they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.679" offset="21498057">That result will follow only if the facts are shown and meet the criteria annunciated in Babcock &amp; Wilcox.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.856" offset="21518746">As the general counsel offered no evidence that would bring the case within Babcock &amp; Wilcox criteria, it files the complaint must be dismissed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.803" offset="21550511">In Visceglia, you had an employer located in a big industrial park.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.469" offset="21573185">The Union came onto the private roads of the industrial park.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.170" offset="21583947">It was an economic strike against that employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.588" offset="21593665">It picketed at the entrance to that employer’s plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.104" offset="21607666">The Board concluded it was a Babcock &amp; Wilcox case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.194" offset="21620101">It said, in so many words, “for the reasons expressed in Central Hardware, we find the principles of Babcock &amp; Wilcox rather than Logan Valley are applicable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.317" offset="21656568">The Board found the Babcock test had been met for many of the reasons that Mr. Gold had indicated, but the Third Circuit reversed that that is not Babcock &amp; Wilcox.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.369" offset="21688751">There are other reasonable alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.815" offset="21694602">The Board did not consider them besides picketing, and therefore, we dismissed the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="5409.764" offset="21742354">Yes, I think he would disagree with both of them because he said there is an absolute right to picket.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.331" offset="21756669">The point I want to make in response to Mr. Gold is that his position has been one that has never been accepted by any Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.621" offset="21781746">The Steel-workers case only said that it was not an 8 (b) (4) secondary boycott violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.353" offset="21800764">It is all the Court says.</text>
            <text syncTime="5425.212" offset="21804107">We do not even have to consider whether there was violence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5427.521" offset="21813407">That is a matter of state law for other provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.064" offset="21823542">It is not a matter for 8 (b) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.172" offset="21832006">So, the answer I think is that picketing is one means of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.399" offset="21852904">It is not the only means of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="5439.348" offset="21860741">It may be more effective in the Union’s mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.692" offset="21870040">It may be more persuasive in many ways, but it is not under a Babcock analysis which is what the Board has been applying, what we would apply in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5450.814" offset="21906507">It is not the only answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.494" offset="21913299">The only difference between the Nickels case and the Visceglia case and the cases at bar is the fact that those are smaller properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.953" offset="21939108">They differed in size.</text>
            <text syncTime="5460.067" offset="21943601">They differed because they were not clustered in a shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.494" offset="21961260">They differed in degree of openness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.291" offset="21968470">But this Court in Lloyd made it clear that is a question of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.414" offset="21984979">It is not a question of principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="5473.290" offset="21996473">There is no difference between those cases and these cases on fundamental principles of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.559" offset="22017580">And, I think that is the point we make here today, that Babcock must apply to all types of property cutting across the line because it is a Section 7 case that if there is a constitutional right under Lloyd, that that is a different question all together and when you apply Babcock, you look to the question of all types of communication not merely just a question of whether you can picket at the struck plant.</text>
