            <text syncTime="18.922" offset="179029">This case presents the question of whether Congress in 1960, when it amended the suits in Admiralty Act, repealed by implication the Public Vessels Act of 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.449" offset="229079">These suits in Admiralty Act, in general expresses the consent of the United States to be sued in Admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.804" offset="258545">The Public Vessels Act however contains specific requirements, which pertain only to suits involving public vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.195" offset="292087">It is the position of the respondent and of the Court of Appeals below that when you have a public vessel that is in involved, the conditions of the suits in Admiralty Act only have to be satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="61.093" offset="347675">No, Your Honor, there is no statutory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.803" offset="362513">One of the problems in the litigation is what is the effect of the absence of no-definition and the question of drawing the line as to what is a public vessel or what is not a public vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="79.541" offset="421445">In any event, I suppose it is conceded that a United Sates Navy Destroyer is a public vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="85.805" offset="446522">That is right, in this case, it is absolutely clear that we a public vessel that is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.739" offset="470242">This particular case arouse as the result of a collision which occurred off the Coast of California, between the Navy Destroyer and a fishing vessel owned by the respondent, a Philippine Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.613" offset="525830">Although I might add, that this Philippine Corporation, in turn was owned by American stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.371" offset="552789">The collision occurred and the fishing vessel, according to the compliant, was sunk, the respondent then brought suit in the District Court alleging jurisdiction under both the suits and Admiralty Act and the Public Vessels Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.612" offset="621752">The Government moved for summary judgment, in our motion we argued that this was a case arising under the Public Vessels Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.379" offset="652890">It involved a pubic vessel, therefore the suit had to satisfy the conditions of the Public Vessels Act, which included a requirement of a showing of reciprocity in suits by for national.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.412" offset="709001">The reciprocity have not been met here and therefore we argued that the suit should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.968" offset="735228">The District Court agreed and entered summary judgment for the United States, the Court of Appeals however reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.212" offset="768142">According to the Court of Appeals the suits in Admiralty Act as it currently stands, as a result of 1960 Amendment, expresses generally the consent of the United States to be sued in Admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.653" offset="825925">No longer when you have a public vessel that is involved although prior to 1960 you had to do so, you have to meet the specific requirements of the Public Vessels Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.001" offset="867303">Accordingly, the Court found that since the general conditions of the suits in Admiralty Act had been satisfied, that the suit could proceed and the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.552" offset="1017559">Suits involving public vessels, which could be brought only under the Public Vessels Act, and one of the problems in this particular area, which I will get to in discussing the legislative history, is that you had cases that did not fit into either category.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.860" offset="1082761">Where there was not a public vessel involved, there was not a merchant vessel involved, and it was very difficult if you had a contract suit because this means you had to sue in the Court of Claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.855" offset="1246705">You could have one or the other, this was a rigid dichotomy that was set out and you could not in fact have a situation where you had a suit that involved, what you would call a public vessel that would also fall into the merchant vessel category, the law due to a rigid dichotomy.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_e_kopp" startTime="599.760" stopTime="1016.326">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Kopp</label>
            <text syncTime="599.760" offset="2502359">Well, take for instance the situation of a privately owned vessel, which is chartered by the Government and used by the Government to carry war materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.801" offset="2550529">Now, this is a situation that would not involve a case to be brought under the Public Vessels Act because you had a privately owned vessel, so the Public Vessels Act was out.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.687" offset="2602042">Now, according to a decision of the Court of Appeals by Judge Vernon Hand (ph), this also involved the case where you did not have a merchant vessel because the ship was not being operated to carry merchant cargo, who is being operated to carry public cargo, war material.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.225" offset="2688247">So, according to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the Calmar Steamship case, this particular situation fell under neither the suits in Admiralty Act nor the Public Vessels Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.619" offset="2741850">Therefore the Court said since you had a contract claim that was involved and since your contract claim was for more than $10,000.00, this suit could be brought only in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.297" offset="2796498">Now that Second Circuit decision was in fact reversed by this Court, but the example of the Second Circuit decision was fresh on the minds of the drafters in Congress of the 1960 Amendment, and the Calmar Steamship case was in fact one of the situations that they attempted to deal with in the 1960 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.249" offset="2896286">Now the 1960 Amendment was passed by Congress because of this very problem demonstrated by the Calmar case, where you had cases that did not fall into the category of Public Vessels or Merchant Vessels, and they could very well fall into the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.393" offset="2972877">And what Congress did to deal with this problem in 1960, it did two things; it eliminated the old distinction that you had between Merchant Vessels and Public Vessels, because this distinction could throw some cases out of either classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.841" offset="3058663">Secondly, Congress wanted to make it very clear that all miscellaneous type of cases, all cases that were hard to classify but were in Admiralty, would fall into the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.110" offset="3119789">So this led to the 1960 Amendments and the specific language, which we now have before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.893" offset="3162944">The Congress amended the language of the suits in Admiralty Act in 742 to come to its present meaning, which is set forth on page three, in cases where if such vessel were privately owned or operated or if such cargo were privately owned or possessed, now here is what was added in 1960, “or if a private person or property were involved, a proceeding in Admiralty could be maintained.”</text>
            <text syncTime="797.882" offset="3294810">The 1960 Amendment added the language, “or if a private person or property were involved,” it also subtracted former language in that section which had included a proviso that, that section apply -- only were merchant vessels were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.394" offset="3384880">So you eliminated, the Congress eliminated the old distinction between Merchant Vessels and Public Vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.510" offset="3417376">Further the Congress in this -- or if a private person or property language added language to the Act that was in fact as broad as the scope of the entire Admiralty jurisdiction, and it did this to make it clear that all Admiralty cases against the United States would now come into the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.982" offset="3511208">You could no longer have the problem of cases falling into the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.828" offset="3538689">Now, the respondent argues that this change had the consequence of arising the Public Vessels Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.000" offset="3575365">The Public Vessels Act prior to this time clearly applied only to public vessels and the respondent now contends that because its situation, of situation involving the public vessel, is a situation where if a private person or property were involved, a proceeding could be maintained, that now it could maintain its action under the suits in Admiralty Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.765" offset="3690408">But Congress did not feel it necessary, when it was amending the suits in Admiralty Act in 1960 to mention the Public Vessels Act for a very particular reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.216" offset="3752162">And that was because the Public Vessels Act in Section 782 contains language, which in effect makes it clear that when there is any conflict between the Public Vessels Act and the suits in Admiralty Act, the Public Vessels Act must prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.964" offset="3831156">Now, this particular language is the language that set out at the bottom of page four of our brief, in Section 782 of the Public Vessels Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.812" offset="3886536">Section 782, in the very last sentence provides such suits, now those are suits set out in Section 781 above for damages caused by a public vessel of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.021" offset="3959365">Such suits shall be subject to and proceed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 20 of this Title, the suits in Admiralty Act, or any amendment thereof insofar as the same are not inconsistent here with.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.544" offset="4033553">In other words, we have in Section 782 a specific provision that declares that in the event of any conflict between the two statutes, the terms of the Public Vessels Act must prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.482" offset="4093216">Thus, in 1960 Congress felt no need to include any expressed guarantees, the Public Vessels Act was not being repealed because it could rest confidently upon this language in Section 782 to prevent this result.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_e_kopp" startTime="1071.491" stopTime="1181.021">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Kopp</label>
            <text syncTime="1071.491" offset="4389340">Okay, in this particular case, the Public Vessels Act contains a reciprocity requirement in Section 785, it provides no suits, and this is at the top of page five, no suit may be brought under Section 781 to 790 of this Title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.689" offset="4474082">That actually means under this Act, that is the way it was in the original statutes, by a national --of any foreign Government unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.039" offset="4523505">That said Government under similar circumstances allows nationals of the United States to sue in its Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.685" offset="4554016">Now, one could in fact read that provision as not creating a conflict with the suits in Admiralty Act, but it’s plain meaning and intent is that obviously Congress felt that if you had a suit involving a public vessel of the United States, and a foreign national were involved, a foreign national could not bring that suit unless he could meet a showing of reciprocity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.250" offset="4660282">And it certainly inconsistent with that interpretation of Section 785, to then turn around and say that the foreign national however could bring suit under the suits in Admiralty Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.787" offset="4710438">The Congress would in fact be giving foreign nationals a more favored status than they would be giving their own citizens, because American citizens in suits involving public vessels would have to sue under the Public Vessels Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.341" offset="4768638">So that is why we say there is a conflict, it is not a strictly -- it is not a conflict that is inherent as a matter of linguistics, but I think in terms of the plain meaning of the statutes, the conflict is quite obvious.</text>

            <text syncTime="1185.014" offset="4843349">That is right, now the Public Vessels Act was enacted because there were certain requirements that Congress felt really were essential in suits involving public vessels, and there are only a handful of such requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.890" offset="4906878">Perhaps the one that was most in the forefront of the Congress at the time that it was enacting the Public Vessels Act was a provision, which is now in Section 784 of the Public Vessels Act that is not in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.538" offset="4969468">Section 784, which provides that subpoenas may not be issued to the members of the crew of a public vessel without the consent of the captain or the secretary of the department concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.992" offset="5035296">This was a condition that the Congress felt was unique to public vessels and it was very important to have that in there because if you had a suit involving a warship, it would be intolerable to permit the vessel to be tied up at a dock while its crew members were off testifying in court, so that is why we have Section 784.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.622" offset="7265840">Well is it in fact a repealer, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and the reason is because the Public Vessels Act consists of a series of extra conditions, more onerous conditions, that Congress has imposed upon the suits in Admiralty Act for suits involving public vessels so that no plaintiff today given his choice between the two statutes is going to sue under the Public Vessels Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.602" offset="7369703">He is always going to sue under the suits in Admiralty Act because the Public Vessels Act for him simply means more trouble, for instance the rules on interest are less favorable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.957" offset="7431143">But no one-- no litigant in the right mind will ever choose to apply the Public Vessels Act because they have available the suits in Admiralty Act which is a more favorable statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.689" offset="7482134">Now there is one situation where the Public Vessels Act is in fact more favorable to litigants and that is in the area of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.512" offset="7525393">The Public Vessels Act and the suits in Admiralty Act both provide that when you have a suit that is brought in the district where the vessel could be found you have to bring suit in that district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.722" offset="7586206">If the vessel cannot be found then you can bring the suit in the district where the plaintiff has his place of business or residence, the suits in Admiralty Act then stops there but the Public Vessels Act goes on to say, if the suit—if the vessel cannot be found or if the plaintiff does not have his place of residence then you can bring suit in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.247" offset="7692263">And -- so in a situation where the vessel cannot be found and the plaintiff has not place and residence, he might be able to get venue under the Public Vessels Act but not under the suits in Admiralty Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.863" offset="7742731">But that is not a very real distinction because why would Congress have set up a statutory scheme that turns for instance on where you could find venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.839" offset="7782647">Further, virtually all public vessels at some point within a two-year period return to the United States and can be found within the United States, so that this little distinction really, is meaningless.</text>

            <text syncTime="1967.495" offset="7973340">Now, if the role of tortfeasor, an innocent victim in this collision were reversed, that is if the Philippine Vessel had been negligent and if were the Government’s vessel which were damaged or sunk, the Government’s remedies are quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.316" offset="8036557">And there is no question at all about what they could have that Philippine vessel arrested and sold interim if necessary in order to satisfy their damage claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.564" offset="8077621">Also they could commence an in personam action against the Philippine owner here in the Courts of our country, as the Government has done in the past, and it has standing to do it in the Courts of the Philippines or in any other civilized nation which follows the general maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.511" offset="8145331">Now, that would be the situation where the Government has been damaged, but in this case, it is the Philippine ship owner who has been damaged and it is the Government we allege which has been negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.328" offset="8196635">What the Government in effect is saying in this lawsuit as I understand their position, is that liability or rising from ship collisions in these circumstances should be a one-way street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.388" offset="8244909">If the Government has been damaged it has a right to recover, but if a Philippine ship owner has been unfortunate enough to have suffered damage as a result of a collision, he has no right to sue--</text>

            <text syncTime="2221.588" offset="8989713">Well that is the way the statute is phrased, but what I am suggesting is unfair is how about the individual Philippine citizen who can be sued in his own country by the United States, or he can be sued here to satisfy their damage claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.980" offset="9047287">I am suggesting that it is unfair to deny equal rights to him as against the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2253.427" offset="9117086">But it is basically unfair to deny an individual citizen, who is subject to the United States’ claim, equal and reciprocal rights under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.973" offset="9159195">Now, we believe that Congress, if I may address myself to the suits in Admiralty Act, we believe that Congress by this Act as amended in 1960 has abolished the pre-existing distinction, which existed between public vessels and merchant vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.368" offset="9228785">The legislative history of the Act recites according to the Senate report, that a substantial portion of a jurisdictional uncertainty in this area is attributable to the confusion in establishing whether a vessel is a merchant vessel or a public vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.805" offset="9298585">And the Courts in the late 40's and early 50's had tremendous difficulty trying to decide what were public vessels and what were merchant vessels and was there a gap between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.607" offset="9341739">And the Senate and the House looked at this confusion and their report reflects that they were concerned about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.767" offset="9370369">And at the bottom or after reciting a number of these cases, the Senate report reflects what the Senate wanted to do about it, and it says that the decisive question in a lawsuit should as far as possible be its merits and not assert here technical problems of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.926" offset="9447065">So this was the Senate’s attitude and this was a House’s attitude when it considered the 1960 Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.960" offset="9471202">We know that they were upset about the confusion, we know that they were upset about the technical disposition of cases and that they desire these cases to be heard against Government on their merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.906" offset="9522924">Now the statute, which they adopted, is perfectly plain, it eliminated the old restriction concerning merchant vessels so that the statute as now worded applies generally to all types of vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.049" offset="9575482">And so the statute on its face is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.999" offset="9587290">The Government says that if we look at the legislative intent we will see that Congress really intended after all to preserve the public vessels distinction and to separate out from the suits in Admiralty Act, damage caused by public vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.928" offset="9647058">But the legislative history is completely silent on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.846" offset="9658761">The Government has been unable to show or to invite our attention to any portion of the legislative history, which would show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.186" offset="9696064">Indeed, if I may say so, or invite the Court’s attention to this Court’s earlier decision in Amell versus United States, which was decided in 1966, shortly after this Act was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.054" offset="9747577">The Court stated in that case that the old distinction was abolished, and the Government’s brief in that case which is a part of the records of this Court is here before me, and if I may quote from page 19, the Government at that time reviewed these jurisdictional problems and then said, the same problem that Congress in the 1960 Act to abolish the distinction between public and merchant government vessels which had caused uncertainty and led to frequent misfilings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.335" offset="9876622">So this was a position of the Government in 1965 when this issue was last presented to the Court.</text>
