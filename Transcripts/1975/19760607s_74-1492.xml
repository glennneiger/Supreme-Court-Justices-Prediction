            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73760">The third case, I have is 74-1492 Washington, Mayor of Washington, D.C. against Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.053" offset="117959">The principal issue in this case is whether the standard test administered to prospective civil service employees of the United States is racially discriminatory and violative of the Due Process Clause of the United States constitution, when it is administered to applicants for the positions on the Metropolitan Police Force for the district of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.547" offset="199879">The District Court held that it was not and sustained the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.769" offset="216807">The Court of Appeals for the district of Columbia Circuit reversed holding that the test had a discriminatory impact and was therefore unconstitutional whether or not a discriminatory purpose had been demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.289" offset="270828">We disagree with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.279" offset="282844">We hold that the proved and unconstitutional racial discrimination under the equal protection or Due Process Clauses, it is essential that a racially discriminatory purpose be shown in some manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.334" offset="327043">We also hold that the District Court was correct in sustaining the test under the applicable statutory standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.137" offset="350240">We consequently reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.204" offset="366540">Mr. Justice Stewart joins parts 1 and 2 of the opinion, but not the remainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.426" offset="387438">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.306" offset="398932">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion and he is joined by Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
