            <text syncTime="51.720" offset="310142">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.982" offset="327279">I am the Assistant Attorney General from Texas and I represent the petitioner in this case, W.J. Estelle, the Director of the Texas Department of Corrections.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.707" offset="374090">We are here on this case on a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.736" offset="410244">The question involved in this case is whether a defendantâ€™s trial in jail clothing is so inherently prejudicial that it destroys his presumption of innocence and therefore denies him a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.928" offset="478998">The respondent in this case Harry Lee Williams was convicted by a jury of assault with intent to murder with malice in November of 1970 in Houston and was assessed by the trial judge, his punishment confinement for ten years in the Texas Department of Corrections.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.428" offset="573039">The Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas affirmed this conviction on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.336" offset="616611">The Federal District Court below then held an evidentiary hearing in a Federal Habeas Corpus Case and denied the respondent relief holding that while trial in jail clothing was inherently prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.521" offset="677424">The evidence of his guilt was so overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.995" offset="715249">The trial in jail clothing was harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.608" offset="729773">United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed this holding and affirming again that trial in jail clothe is inherently prejudicial but they found that harmless error was not available in this particular -- the state of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.498" offset="825277">And although the Fifth Circuit had held in the Hernandez case 1971 for the first time specifically stating that trial in jail clothing was inherently prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.464" offset="881179">In the Williams case they held for the first time that the decision was to be given retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.622" offset="921826">Our contention is that the United States constitution while it guarantees a fair trial does not guarantee a perfect trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.445" offset="969055">And we contend that trying a man in jail clothing is not so fundamentally unfair to destroy the presumption of innocence and deny a man a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.786" offset="1034466">A juror is aware or most jurors are, that defendants are arrested and there are kept in the jail prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.035" offset="1071455">And when a defendant is brought into the Court room in jail clothing that the jurors are not so surprised or shocked.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.836" offset="1478652">I believe the last thing we talked about was Judge Blackmun had asked the attire of the defendants who were brought into the Court room and I would like to say that they did not have on, the striped uniform with the little striped head.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.429" offset="1565065">It was a pair of white coveralls and most cases with Harris County Jail stenciled across at the back of the uniform and sometimes down at the leg of one of the pair of the trousers they had on.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.401" offset="1668928">I would also like to point out to the Court that there were none of these defendants as far as I can determine that were compelled to go to trial in the jail clothes they had on.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.198" offset="1748131">The reason they were tried was because the attorney raised no objection to the trial judge asking that they be tried in the any other type of clothing and the clothes they had on.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.595" offset="1809675">And it is our position that being tried in jail clothing is not anymore prejudicial to the defendant and then bring to the jury of the indictment or under -- or agreeing to the jury of prior convictions alleged in the indictment for enhancement of the State, habitual criminal statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.880" offset="1970799">However, the prosecuting attorney on the board of the whole jury panel did, so to speak asked and the jurors if the fact that the defendant was in jail clothing would have any kind of effect on.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.482" offset="2041225">And none of the jurors posed an objection and the defense attorney did the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.102" offset="2067765">He said the fact that this man sitting over here with the jail clothes on, do they have any effect on and again none of the jurors expressed otherwise.</text>
