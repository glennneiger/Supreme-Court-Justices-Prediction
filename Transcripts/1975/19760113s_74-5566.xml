            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="5.374" offset="95095">This is as 74-5566 Barrett against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.223" offset="118501">It comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.479" offset="139504">It raises the issue whether a provision of the Gun Control Act of 1968 which is Section 922 (h) of Title 18 of the code, making it unlawful for a convicted felon to receive any firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate commerce has application to a convicted felon's intrastate purchase from a local retail dealer of a firearm that previously, but independently had been transported in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.463" offset="295507">Petitioner Barrett in 1967 was convicted of a felony in a Kentucky state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.245" offset="322570">Five years later, he purchased 32-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver from a Western Auto Store in Booneville, Kentucky, where he lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.795" offset="364784">The weapon had been manufactured in Massachusetts and then shipped to a distributor in North Carolina and then received by the Kentucky dealer from the North Carolina distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.114" offset="414103">Barrett bought it off the shelf from the Booneville Store.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.949" offset="433433">After the revolver fully loaded was discovered in Barrett's possession as he was arrested by a county sheriff for driving while intoxicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.531" offset="467706">Barrett was charged with the violation of a Federal Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.992" offset="485574">The Federal trial court instructed the jury that the statute's interstate requirements was satisfied if the firearm at sometime in the past had traveled in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.564" offset="531863">Irrespective of the defendant's non-involvement personally in that transportation across the state line, the verdict of guilty was returned and on appeal, the Court of Appeals by divided vote affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.220" offset="598527">Because this holding seemed to conflict with the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit in another case, we granted certiorari limited to the interstate issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.585" offset="640010">In an opinion filed today, we affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit and hold that the statute does indeed apply to a convicted felon's intrastate purchase of a firearm that previously, but independently of the felon's receipt had been transported in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.302" offset="714824">I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice White while joining the opinion has filed a separate concurring opinion and that Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.067" offset="769891">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
