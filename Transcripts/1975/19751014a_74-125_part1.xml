            <label>Mr. J. Gordon Cook</label>
            <text syncTime="29.271" offset="117029">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.159" offset="164571">I am sure you recognize the basic proposition at issue herein which is simply whether or not allowing a lessee of Arizona School Trust Land to share in condemnation proceeds except as to the value of improvement violates the Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.772" offset="267076">Now, the Court of Appeals below, when it reversed the District Court, recognized this by saying that provision, referring to the Fifth Amendment, would guarantee to Alamo the right to compensation if they had obtained from Arizona a Property Right superior or equal to the Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.556" offset="378149">So, it really turns upon an interpretation of the Trust and turns upon whether or not the Trust did permit a Property Right to be created in the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.386" offset="441469">When you look at the provisions of the Trust, I submit, you find as Justice Rehnquist said in the Lassen case, the Act to Silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.098" offset="496327">He said there concerning whether or not a special rule created by the Arizona Supreme Court as to condemnation should be allowed on the face of the Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.656" offset="550557">The Act’s silence obligates us to examine its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.809" offset="567171">My opponent puts a lot of reliance upon Lassen, but I say that Lassen is not contrary to my position.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.143" offset="596532">I would like to point out that what happened in Lassen was the Arizona Supreme Court, for some reason, not following a recognized Arizona Statutory Principles as to condemnation in school trust lands, in Lassen, in footnote 11, there is an explanation of Arizona Condemnation Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.944" offset="687752">The Arizona Condemnation Law does say that when a right of way is taken as to the actual land taken, I am not now talking about any severed damages to the remainder, that that right of way, the agency must pay for that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.779" offset="767060">Now, the Arizona Supreme Court as to school trust lands did not follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.024" offset="788062">There is no really good reason why it did not follow it because it was against the Arizona Law, and they said as to the school trust lands, well, we think that because there is a benefit to the remainder not taken that is offset by whatever is taken for the right of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.830" offset="863295">That is not what Arizona Law is, and so I am saying that all Lassen amounts to is that it says that the regular rules of condemnation law are applicable to school trust, and that is all I urge upon you, is application of the regular rules of condemnation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.921" offset="943647">I refer in part to a quotation from Lassen at 87 Supreme Court, page 584, it referring to the Enabling Act, intended instead that Arizona would use the general powers of sale and lease, given to it by the Act to accumulate funds with which it could support the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.990" offset="1047928">I submit to you that if we consider those general powers, there is no evidence below that there was a violation of the general powers simply because the State of Arizona in the lease did not insert a condemnation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.725" offset="1110831">Now, by condemnation clause, I mean the clause that says that upon the taking of the land by condemnation, only the landlord gets the proceeds.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.936" offset="1427644">I would like to, first to discuss two cases that your Court, when certiorari was granted, handled together, and that is the Fuller case and incidentally, Mr. Fuller is the President of the Alamo Land and Cattle Corporation and these are adjoining properties developed almost at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.633" offset="1526491">So here we are again, except you have a different lawyer on behalf of Alamo than the one representing Mr. Fuller.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.857" offset="1563376">The Fuller case and the Almota case were both taken by your Court at the same time, and both of those recognized general principles that I submit did protect one other than the owner of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.970" offset="1627847">Now, in Fuller you had the issue of whether or not in determining the value of fee land taken by the Federal Government, whether any increase in value of that land by virtue of its use with Taylor Grazing land was something that could be compensable and in the Almota case, there was some dissent in that case too.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.583" offset="1750309">The question was whether as to a railroad siding, the jury or trier of fact upon condemnation could consider a non-legally enforced expectancy of renewal which was going on for some number of scores of years and the majority held it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.554" offset="1834214">I do not wish to predicate my case upon whatever arguments you had between you, as to the majority in the dissent in that particular case because here, Alamo’s right was more than a mere expectancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.579" offset="1890220">Here Alamo had a right, which I have shown by two Arizona cases to sue one who would upon renewal of the lease, be awarded the releasing privileges.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="490.652" offset="1962527">Except, if there were a reclassification, now what does that mean?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Gordon Cook</label>
            <text syncTime="495.913" offset="1983634">That is what all the evidence below was about and that simply means that the use is a higher use, and therefore, more rent and upon reclassification, there is also a preferred right of renewal to a lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.922" offset="2035670">For example, if it is determined the land is suitable for agricultural purposes and there was substantial evidence below it was not, then it would be reclassified to agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.058" offset="2076212">If it was then reclassified to commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.946" offset="2091781">What the trial below all about was how many years would it be until the land would be reclassified for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.258" offset="2125009">The evidence being that but for the dam, the nearest paved road was 30 miles away, the land is, you can see on a map that I referred to in the statement of facts, some 70 or 80 miles from the nearest big city, it is truly isolated remote Arizona land and there was no evidence below, I submit to show that but for reclassification, Alamo would not have continued in possession.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="556.484" offset="2225842">So they thought that the evidence would allow at least two ten-year renewals before any possibility of reclassification?</text>

            <text syncTime="595.678" offset="2382681">So what I was trying to say, gentlemen, when you consider the two cases that I referred to, the Fuller case and the Almota case, they do recognize that one, not the owner does have Fifth Amendment Rights upon condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.684" offset="2442658">I would like to point out in the Fuller case, even though the Taylor Grazing permits were only for periods of one year, it did not say that just because it is only a one-year right, and because that is that the women can preace to the government that for that reason, there could not be any condemnation rights in the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.449" offset="2533773">Instead, you examine the Taylor Grazing Act and instead, you said, that Act specifically said that nothing should create any right, title, interest or estate in and to the lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.249" offset="2584973">No such wording exists in the Arizona Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.067" offset="2604199">It does not say there cannot be created any right, title, interest or estate in the lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.481" offset="2625829">All the provision say is if the land is disposed of by the state, which did not happen here, state did not dispose of the land, it is done so at the appraised value and if there is a contrary disposition, there is a breach of the trust and it becomes null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.080" offset="2696255">Now, if you look at the Congressional Record and I have examined it and you will find nothing helpful and probably the best part of a Congressional Record and the only part I can find that has any bearing is in the Arizona Supreme Court decision in Lassen which refers to the Senate Record and there what they were talking about was some abuses, where some of this land was given by the Federal government by Enabling Act to the state, and the politicians found ways that would make Watergate seem like kindergarten to get those lands back into their hands for not really fair prices and there was a great converse -- I am sorry, in Appendix to the Senate Report referred to in the Arizona Supreme Court decision of Lassen that went into some of the abuses in the New Mexico Tall Timber Cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.537" offset="2886113">And that is what congress had in mind, when it was saying, if the state sells land, it should be at this fair appraised value.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.111" offset="2920385">They did not say anything about condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.896" offset="2927491">They did not talk about condemnation.</text>
