            <label>Mr. Carson P. Porter</label>
            <text syncTime="70.853" offset="388175">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.011" offset="404789">I am here today on behalf of the petitioners, the Chief Police of Louisville, Kentucky and Jefferson County, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.253" offset="433733">This case arises out of a factual situation which began when the respondent was arrested for shoplifting at Louisville Retail Store back in the summer of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.361" offset="478141">Subsequently, in September of 1971, this individual had his case by his motion filed away with leave which under Kentucky Law constitutes a general continuance of the charges of shoplifting.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.350" offset="542193">Subsequently in December of 1972, the petitioners sent a flyer to a number of merchants in our community indicating that the person’s named in that flyer had been arrested for shoplifting in the past two years and were “active shoplifters.”</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="125.920" stopTime="127.898">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="125.920" offset="608440">Well, there is quite a difference between the two, is there not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carson_p_porter" startTime="127.898" stopTime="344.962">
            <label>Mr. Carson P. Porter</label>
            <text syncTime="127.898" offset="616381">I do not think there is any question about that Mr. Chief Justice and that is the real heart of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.880" offset="640309">Subsequently, the respondent after finding out about the circulation of this flyer had the status of his case changed on his motion from filed away from the general continuance status, the criminal charge was changed to dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.135" offset="697256">He then brought an action or attempted to do so in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.862" offset="732156">And right there, I think is the knot of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.070" offset="748979">The question being in short, did the respondent bring his action in the right Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="167.643" offset="775310">We submitted to the District Court that the respondent had failed to state a claim under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.581" offset="803104">For, in fact, the allegations which he set forth by the factual circumstances, I just recited the statement of active shoplifters.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.329" offset="838108">No question, that is different from his status as an arrested person.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.131" offset="857230">But that constitutes in our estimation and in the estimation of the District Court of Kentucky, at best an allegation of defamation which is cognizable in the Circuit Courts of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and not under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.512" offset="926820">They contended in their compliant that the right privilege or immunity which had been denied to the respondent was one of two things, either (a) a deprivation of his constitutional right of privacy or (b) a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.704" offset="991604">I would like to focus the Court’s attention if you will firstly, on their allegation that this gentleman has been denied, he is alleged constitutional right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.345" offset="1038102">We basically submit it to the District Court and the District Court held in his failure to state the claim decision that the facts of this case did not give rise to a constitutional, protected right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.069" offset="1104975">And I think the teachings of the Sixth Circuit since this Court -- nobody in this case has been able to cite a decision rendered by this Court dispositive with this issue or where this Court has recognized a constitutional right of privacy in the defamation area.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.389" offset="1178327">We have of course learned about Griswold for married folks in contraceptives and Eisenstock for unmarried people and the abortion case in Roe versus Wade but not what we consider to be primarily, if not totally, a defamation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.182" offset="1241439">But the Ninth Circuit had a similar case.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.698" offset="1251575">Back in 1963, they decided in a split decision York versus Torrie(ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="291.990" offset="1272681">Now, in that case the majority held that the factual circumstances there did in fact arise to a constitutional invasion and I would submit to the Court that that decision was correct and I would embrace it because the facts in that case are entirely different from the facts in the case at Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.364" offset="1350213">For example, in York, a young lady had gone to the Local Police Department to complain about being raped.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.781" offset="1383859">When she got there, a police officer acting as a Police Officer took her into a room, asked her to strip nude, posed her and as the Court said, lured in lascivious poses and took photographs over and then circulate the photographs to all of his friends on the police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.334" offset="1450105">Now, I would suggest that that as the Court held shocked the conscience of that Court, shocks my conscience and I think it would shock the conscience of this Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="344.962" stopTime="356.946">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="344.962" offset="1484587">It is so but you do not need to concede the correctness of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.357" offset="1502141">It may have shocked all of our consciences but it may not have been violation of any constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.554" offset="1522935">In other words, we do not have that case before us.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carson_p_porter" startTime="356.946" stopTime="490.920">
            <label>Mr. Carson P. Porter</label>
            <text syncTime="356.946" offset="1532548">You are exactly right Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.007" offset="1536727">I was drawing that case to show what they did in the same Circuit six years later in a case very similar to the one at Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.676" offset="1567447">Baker versus Howard, in that case, the Ninth Circuit held unanimously that the fact situation did not arise to a constitutional deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.414" offset="1610392">Therein in fact there was proof that Baker had had a statement alleging that he had committed a crime, broadcast to the general public pursuant to the direction of the police department over the radio stations and had in fact lost his job because of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.518" offset="1686775">I would submit that to be a potential denial of the property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.445" offset="1702552">The Ninth Circuit in that case held did not constitute or deprivation that this was not the kind of case that was cognizable under Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.956" offset="1740587">Now, in the transcript before you in this case at the evidentiary hearing held on the motion for preliminary injunction which the District Court denied. Respondent called two witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.570" offset="1795026">They called the employer of the respondent for the purpose of attempting to show to the Court the loss which respondent had suffered because of this dissemination.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.436" offset="1846539">But the best testimony that was advanced there was that the employer knew about it, had thought about restricting his employee’s activities as a photographer for the local newspaper but in fact when asked by the judge, “What had you done?”</text>
            <text syncTime="451.952" offset="1912577">He said, “Nothing Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.980" offset="1920623">I have taken no action against this gentleman whatsoever.”</text>
            <text syncTime="457.145" offset="1933370">Some interesting distinctions between our fact situation and Baker versus Howard.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.213" offset="1953641">I respectfully submit to the Court that if the teaching of Baker versus Howard is correct where the gentleman lost his job because of the dissemination, and where in this case, there has been no proof, advanced whatsoever at any type of grievous injury then I respectfully submit that this case does not even rise on the hierarchical ladder to Baker versus Howard much less approach, the grievous loss in York versus Torrie.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="490.920" stopTime="509.175">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="490.920" offset="2068476">Well supposing that there had been an inadequate showing in your view of significant loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.997" offset="2096688">As I read your brief, your contention is that nonetheless if the loss itself is not imposed by the sovereign power of the government then it is not cognizable under 1983?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carson_p_porter" startTime="509.175" stopTime="550.851">
            <label>Mr. Carson P. Porter</label>
            <text syncTime="509.175" offset="2141410">Yes, Your Honor, what we are saying is while we are admitting for the purposes of argument, these actions were taken under color of law which put us under the first aspect of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.318" offset="2182056">We are submitting that we do not and we have not deprived the respondent of any right, privilege, or immunity guaranteed by the constitution or the Federal Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.445" offset="2222494">Therefore, since he cannot make up a case, he failed to state the claim advancing both propositions which are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.776" offset="2255826">We contend that what he has basically is a defamation case and that he should be suing us if he wishes to do so in the Circuit Courts of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.138" offset="2301279">That is the heart of this lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3101.159" offset="12509410">There are a couple of points which I should like to address the Court’s attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.285" offset="12525919">What I think falls in the area of what I like to characterize as a factual misstatement by my learned colleague, Mr. Taylor in analyzing the status of filed away in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and putting it in the proper context of this particular litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.895" offset="12600316">One of the interesting points is that this gentleman at that time the dissemination was made was in a status where his case was subject to being reopened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.420" offset="12642425">It was not until after the dissemination was made that Mr. Taylor came to the Local Police Court and petitioned for dismissal of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.523" offset="12674817">The second and most important thing, I would like follow up on is Mr. Justice Powell’s comments regarding prior restraint on a significant First Amendment freedom of these two particular Chiefs of Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.659" offset="12727375">The question really being in the end result is this Court going to say to the factual circumstances presented here today that before these petitioners made these editorial and potentially defamatory remarks about this respondent, they had to hold a full evidentiary due process hearing or as we respectfully submit and petition the Court to adapt the proposition that the proper remedy lies in the Circuit Courts of the Commonwealth of Kentucky for defamation.</text>
