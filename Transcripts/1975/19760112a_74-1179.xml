            <text syncTime="15.551" offset="167585">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.169" offset="182005">This case involves Fourth Amendment claims, concerning two grand jury subpoenas of the bank records.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.950" offset="217114">In January 1973, while fighting a fire at a warehouse in Kathleen, Georgia which was rented to the respondent, local law enforcement officials discovered a distillery, a quantity of non-tax-paid whiskey and related paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.079" offset="297675">Several weeks earlier a van-type truck occupied by two of respondents, later alleged co-conspirators was stopped on the basis of information from an informant and found to contain distillery apparatus.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.347" offset="382730">As a result of these two incidents, two grand jury subpoenas were issued from the United States Attorney’s Office to banks in nearby communities in which the respondent had bank accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.769" offset="456395">This was in the conduct of the investigation being conducted by the United States Attorney’s Office and Treasury Department Agents on behalf of the grand jury..</text>
            <text syncTime="98.981" offset="501326">The obvious purpose of the subpoenas was to determine whether the records of the respondent's account would reflect transactions that would connect him with the maintenance or operation of the distillery discovered during the fire with its proceeds and that would connect that operation with the van that had been stopped a few weeks earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.188" offset="614070">And I would to interject at the outset that this is a normal method of investigating an incident of this kind and we believe an entirely proper line of investigation, if anything, and major thrust of this Court’s criminal procedure decisions in the past forty years has been to encourage law enforcement officials to seek objective, reliable, documentary, real evidence of the sort from third parties rather than focus the investigation entirely on trying to illicit incriminating statements from the suspects themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.722" offset="2056238">A pretrial motion to suppress evidence secured by the subpoenas was denied by the Trial Court and at the trial, some evidence procured by these subpoenas was introduced and the subpoenas also gave the investigators some leads that may have led to other evidence introduced at the trial and the respondent was convicted on all five counts, so that he was charged and given concurrent sentences of three years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.477" offset="2187269">On appeal, the Court of Appeals in effect held that his pretrial motion to suppress should have been granted on the three grounds asserted in that motion and the Government’s petition for rehearing en banc was denied by an eight to seven of vote of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.057" offset="2269607">In our view, the basic error at the Court of Appeals, the panel’s opinion and decision in this case is in its holding that the alleged defects in the subpoena violated as that Court put the respondents right to privacy in the bank’s records of his account.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.295" offset="2386531">It seems to us this holding departs from this Court’s admonition in Katz against the United States that the Fourth Amendment cannot be translated into a general constitutional right to privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.977" offset="2457270">Pertinent language of the Fourth Amendment that we are concerned with in this case, appears on page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.156" offset="2493946">The right of the people to be secure in their person, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizure shall not be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.330" offset="2534697">Now, Katz held that that right to be securing one's person, includes security from unreasonable intrusions by the uninvited ear of the Government as well as other protections, but neither Katz nor any other case of this Court has ever held that these protections apply to anything other than the claimant's own person, houses, papers, or effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.266" offset="2658413">In fact, the rule has been precisely the contrary that the Fourth Amendment does not protect what is often referred to as just tertiary interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.547" offset="2711598">That it is only the person whose own person, papers, house or effects are the subject of the search and has standing to complain of non-compliance with the Fourth Amendment, not someone against whom that evidence may later be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.895" offset="2784950">This has been reiterated time and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.580" offset="2795713">The modern cases that spell it out start with Goldstein against the United States and go on through Jones, Wong Sun and Alderman, all of which are quite specific on this point and the Court has also applied this doctrine with specific reference to the papers of third parties that concern transactions between those third parties and the person seeking to complain of the intrusion into those papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.421" offset="2947014">It was done in both Donaldson against the United States, involving a former employer's records, concerning Donaldson and then later in California Bankers against Shultz, where the Court pointed out that as long ago as 1925, it had decided that an internal revenue summons directed to a third party bank was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of either the bank or the person under investigation by the taxing authorities and then quoted with approval, Mr. Justice Douglas’ statement concurring in Donaldson that it is difficult to see how the summoning of a third party and the records of a third party can violate the rights of the tax payer, even if a criminal prosecution is contemplated or in progress, which seems to us to be directly on point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.530" offset="3219523">As the Court also pointed out in Couch against the United States, the landmark precedent concerning the Fourth Amendment protection of private papers, Boyd against the United States did not contemplate, the Court said in Couch, the divergence of ownership and possession of the papers and a fortiori it did not contemplate the complete lack of possession or ownership of the papers by the person making the complaint which is the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.968" offset="3373228">These records are owned and maintained by the banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="846.251" offset="3490361">So, the papers themselves belong to the bank, their papers which the bank had consent to a search of without any right of the petitioner to prevent the bank from voluntarily turning them over to the Government under this Court’s consent search cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.996" offset="3585342">And, this leaves only the question whether because the information was secured from the petitioner's checks and in the course of transactions between the petitioner and the bank whether that information is somehow protected or whether the petitioner has standing to claim that the information cannot be disclosed by the bank to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.753" offset="3704356">This is in our view not really a Fourth Amendment claim, but because the Fourth Amendment does not protect against the disclosure of the information itself that was pointed out in United States against White, that the person with whom -- had the conversation in Katz could later testify about it, so long as it was a non-privilege conversation and not a confidential communication with a privileged relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.030" offset="3821489">The protection of the information itself is really the providence of the law of testimony or privileges for confidential communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.617" offset="3863807">And here, there is no such privilege recognized between a bank and a bank customer anymore than there is between an individual and his accountant or others with whom he conducts business transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1205.515" offset="4927409">We are concerned here only with the record keeping requirements and those requirements do not change the fact that the records belong to the bank and are records of its own financial transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.862" offset="5132836">We do not urge, however, that that should be the end of the matter in this Court, if the Court agrees with us because the Court of Appeals went on to hold that the subpoenas were defective in three respects and we would urge the Court to consider the course of action here that it adopted in Donaldson where after holding that Mr. Donaldson did not have a right to intervene, to contest the validity of the Internal Revenue summons and nonetheless because of the importance of the issue to the administration of Justice and the fact that it had been presented to the Court went on to decide that the summons was being used to for a proper purpose in any event which was the issue that Mr. Donaldson had sought to raise through his attempted intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.268" offset="5326456">Here, there is even more reason to go on and comment about these alleged defects in the subpoena because unlike the situation in Donaldson, there is a holding by the Court of Appeals on this subject which technically would be vacated, still a holding that would be troublesome in the administration of criminal Justice in the Fifth Circuit of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3071.823" offset="12392683">And also they have held that the compulsory financial statements required of public officials violates an individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy as to his financial affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.935" offset="12505114">And I would note in closing that as we have indicated in brief there are state cases where the depositors have enforced their contractual and tort right to privacy as to the rights of depositors for unreasonable -- disclosing these materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.725" offset="12596229">I would also cite a case that I do not have in brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.429" offset="12607096">It is a Third Circuit case Zimmermann v. Wilson, 81 F.2d 847 (3d Cir. 1936).</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.940" offset="12641159">This case was somewhat modified at a later date, but if indeed there is a reasonable expectation of privacy as to these records on the part of bank depositors, I believe the language in this case where in fact, they note as even in the old case of Entick versus Carrington, that really is not the paper, it is the information on the paper that is sought to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.895" offset="12736976">And we contend here that the interaction, the compulsory recording of all these records by the banks under the Bank Secrecy Act with the interaction of these subpoenas does indeed invade an area where depositors reasonably and justifiably can and should be protected.</text>
