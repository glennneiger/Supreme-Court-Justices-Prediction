            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104374">We will hear arguments next in 75-62, Runyon against McCrary and the related and consolidated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.650" offset="362882">Mr. Koutoulakos, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Koutoulakos</label>
            <text syncTime="67.269" offset="373435">Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Justices, I represent the Bobbe's School which is Mr. and Mrs. Runyon operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.384" offset="425889">I will limit my argument to the narrow areas of what I considered the crucial issue in this case and if necessary we will rebut on the point of statute of limitations on the right of attorney’s fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.513" offset="474372">Now first, let me touch on the facts a little bit as to the reason why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.950" offset="492136">The Bobbe’s School is a small school in Arlington, Virginia and in Fairfax, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.722" offset="507182">It is like the only line that operates a private school.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.905" offset="523901">It has been stipulated in the facts that here at the school is not supported in anyway by any federal or state money and it depends entirely on the support upon the student enrolment.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.210" offset="585132">Insofar as the Bobbe’s School is concerned -- now this case was consolidated with the Brewster School -- but insofar as the Bobbe’s School is concerned, Mr. and Mrs. McCrary and Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales testified and of course this is unrebutted that as a result of a telephone call, it is by both parties, one in 69 and one in 71 or 2 as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.826" offset="667678">And no further contact and no formal application, as a result of a telephone call, it brought into play the Section 1981, the Civil Rights Act that we are now hereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.864" offset="715744">And the Court upon hearing evidence -- and there is a serious question in my mind as to whether or not in the dissent found in the Greenough, but what I am going to say that there is a serious question as to whether or not they made out a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.901" offset="759943">It certainly did not rebut the fact that there are selected standards of exclusion by our school. There is no evidence contrary to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.748" offset="787319">I think that all the evidence is clear that no one would be admitted on the basis of a phone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.703" offset="807172">There has to be a formal application and certain admission policies that are necessary, such as the medical examination or personal interview with the parent and based on that, then it is determined as to whether not the person is to be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.119" offset="864746">Now, it seems to me that the bedrock or what the plaintiffs are relied upon to be here is the Jones case.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.815" offset="907587">First, starting off with Section 1981, I just quote it briefly, it says that, “All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every state and territory to make an enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as it enjoyed by white citizens.”</text>
            <text syncTime="221.707" offset="991179">Now, I will jump to the Jones case, because as I said that seems to be the foundation of private discrimination and really that is what I think we are hereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.492" offset="1026287">Now, first at the outset, I want to make this observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.473" offset="1038199">Being of great heritage, it is not a question whether I agree or do not agree with respective policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.023" offset="1064426">I am here as Mr. Justice Marshall used to in the old days, support individual rights and his battle to eliminate abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.050" offset="1108521">Well, I am here in support of an individual right of a citizen in this country or any person in this country, the right of privacy and the right to freely choose his associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.911" offset="1148018">Now the Jones case says that private discrimination, at least in contract matters, is barred by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.924" offset="1188038">Now, without getting in the place whether I agree or do not agree with that decision, I do not want to say that that decision can be distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.367" offset="1209772">First, if we get to the 1883 Civil Rights cases, I think in those cases, this Honorable Court, there determined that Congress is limited as to what it can do under certain basic rights that transcend and militate against the rights of Congress or any other political body to regulate against.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.740" offset="1307261">And I am talking about the freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.057" offset="1316560">Now it seems to me that we are at the crossroads and I have tried to read and I am not certainly the smartest man in the world nor the most brilliant legal author, but it seems to me that just plain common sense at least to me that conclusion that this country is based on two things and it separates us from other nations and that is the most basic thing as the right to be the left alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.375" offset="1409870">The right of individual freedom, which of course, incorporates with it and I think that it is protected by the Bill of Rights, but I think this right transcends the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.142" offset="1448844">I think it is a God-given right to be left alone and to be free and as the Pierce and the Yoder and the Meyer cases indicated with reference to private schools and the right of an education there is certainly no constitutional right on education.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.134" offset="1504851">This Court has held that once a state steps in and provides in the education, then due process requires that all people be treated alike independent to color and I certainly subscribe to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.902" offset="1543930">But we are talking about public schools, when we get into the area of Private Schools I think all the cases that I have read from this Court, and I do not know I want to take your time citing, but in the end they all point to the fact that private schools do have a right to exist regardless of their discriminatory policies, and I think they have got that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.506" offset="1610385">I think anymore than I have the right to invite whoever I want to in my home and the argument would be, well, this is a private school however, it does require a certain amount of touch with the public, is that not sufficient to bring it within any ambit of the Meyer case, and I say no.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="391.711" stopTime="399.662">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="391.711" offset="1671198">Well, why is that any difficult that an employer says, we should have, as a private employer, the right to choose whom he wants to as his employee?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_koutoulakos" startTime="399.662" stopTime="520.349">
            <label>Mr. Louis Koutoulakos</label>
            <text syncTime="399.662" offset="1702963">Well because I think as the dissent pointed out in this case, in the Runyon case that this right of association is personal situations that come into play in the private school, and I think parents, if the parent has the right, as this court said in the Pierce case, to select a school on the education for its children, then I say that this is a concomitant right on the private school to select the student it wants to educate, and I feel that that right has to be a fundamentally protected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.419" offset="1842039">It seems to me that the right of contract, if the Jones case is accepted to its fullest analysis, then it gives the right to a group that no other group can have in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.886" offset="1891881">It gives a unilateral right to force a contract when that violates and emasculates all the rules of contract and at least I have been introduced to both in law school and since my active career as a practitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.556" offset="1942558">It seems to me that the contract right that they are talking about at 1981 dealt with of course the eliminating the shackles of slavery and should have been, there is no argument on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.237" offset="1981220">And that is all we are talking about because the blacks did not have a right to contract and as a result of that that they were submitted to the humiliation that those folks had to go through, and that is what we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.275" offset="2021448">They certainly are not talking about and I do not believe they intended to talk about the fact that a private school like a private individual is mandate to accept the contract by somebody they do not want to accept the contract with, anymore than I can be forced to accept the contract or anybody else because contracts require mutuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.185" offset="2097099">If we are going to get into the (Inaudible), legalities and explanations of rights and duties and if we are going to get in to contractual rights, whether it would be Wilson or anybody else, whatever it may be, I have never seen in any legislation, any contract forced upon an individual, lacks in the mutuality of the minds and that is exactly what is being done here.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.459" offset="2210157">And what you say is certainly correct as I remember my contract from law school except that if a school, your client, says we will never ever make any offered to anybody at the Negro race.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.419" offset="2277971">So nobody in the Negro race will ever have an opportunity of accepting.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.471" offset="2298242">Is that not depriving everybody in the Negro race of his right to make a contract?</text>

            <text syncTime="603.950" offset="2520074">Well, maybe in the pure sense it would, but in the sense of a right and a duty that the contract would bring into play then I say that that statute cannot do that because it cannot force a person to undergo a contract he does not wish to.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.824" offset="2567616">And I think that has been fundamental in all our cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.955" offset="2576185">There is actually no decision that I have seen anywhere, and of course I could not possibly, that says, you Mr. Koutoulakos must be mandated to accept the contract whether you want it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.361" offset="2617772">That is exactly what the interpretation of 1981 would have to do, and I say, no, that is not the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2393.138" offset="9676893">My name is George Leonard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.850" offset="9687760">I represent an intervenor on the District Court by the name of the Southern Independent School Association, approximately 375 schools and approximately 175,000 children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.622" offset="9746797">The factual discussions which the Court has heard up to this point do not affect this particular intervenor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.149" offset="9780965">We stipulated with Mr. Brown in the lower court that these schools do in fact, without any question, discriminate against Negroes because of their color.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.750" offset="9847316">And exactly the same sets that a black school may discriminate against whites because of his color or a Chinese or a French school or any other kind of school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.881" offset="9887858">We do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.452" offset="9894127">We have stipulated that the majority of the schools represented by this particular association actually have that particular limitation on their admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.296" offset="9933520">So the factual question of whether we do or do not is not in this case as far as the intervenor is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.361" offset="9973749">The issue as it was stated by both the majority and minority in the Fourth Circuit, we believe to be too narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.583" offset="10014604">They said the issue was, is an otherwise qualified black child entitled to be admitted to any school of his choice, a private school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.194" offset="10081060">The actual issue in this case is much broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.041" offset="10096524">It comes up under 1981 and involves the First Amendment and the freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.526" offset="10122438">The actual issue in this case is whether any child of any color may attend any school of his choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.741" offset="10171234">If he is a boy, may he attend the girls’ school?</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.180" offset="10185027">If he is a Jew, may he attend the Catholic School?</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.064" offset="10204567">If he is a Chinese, may he attend the school for Mexican-Americans?</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.699" offset="10231107">The question is truly and about as broad as this Court sought to be back in the Pierce case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.015" offset="10264335">Namely just how far do the options of a parent go in trying to decide what kind of education that child will have?</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.098" offset="10304668">Now I hold no brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.314" offset="10317625">This intervenor does not make any claim that its parents are right and other parents are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.011" offset="10344374">That white children alone should gather and all other should be mixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.576" offset="10362660">We stand for the proposition and we claim it before this Court and we have claimed that before courts below that every parent with a school child in this country may select a school that that parent believes, given some basic mathematical and reading ability, that that parent believes will develop the child into the kind of person that the parent wants it to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.867" offset="10627750">There was a Zionist Church and school in Illinois many, many years ago and they taught that the earth was flat and the question was whether they could so teach?</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.616" offset="10726807">Certain basic mathematics, we have in the Rodriguez opinion from this Court for example, the question of whether education itself is not a constitutional right but there is some sort of amorphous beginning of education, probably the ability to read and write and do simple sums which every child is entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.459" offset="10830147">If a school does not provide that, I think it would be completely and utterly proper for the state to say we will not qualify you, we will not justify you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.699" offset="10871107">But if you give them the basic education then what you give them in addition to that whether it is religious training, whether it is training for home economics for girls in the girls school, whether it is bricklaying for boys in the boys school, it makes no difference provided that the fundamental education at the core is given.</text>

            <text syncTime="3597.920" offset="14495963">My co-counsel Mr. Boggs will present argument in the case in which the plaintiffs below are the petitioners, that is number 75-306, the case -- the evasions are about a proceeding pertaining to the matter of attorney’s fees and the applicable statute limitations in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.695" offset="14575061">In my argument concerning the question of whether private schools may discriminate on the basis of race, the matter really resolves itself as Mr. Justice Stewart has just indicated to two essential problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="3660.811" offset="14747574">With respect to the first issue of the statute, this Court has indicated previously of course that the two provisions of the 1866 Civil Rights Act should be read in a literal way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.496" offset="14806297">That was a plain holding in Jones v. Mayer and it is been holding in the Sullivan versus Little Hunting Park and Tillman versus Wheaton-Haven Recreation Association and indeed it is the essence of the holding and Johnson versus Railway Express Agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="4052.622" offset="16314816">Now, the argument has been made by the schools here in their arguments before the Court that this involves a coercion making of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.629" offset="16366852">It is a matter of prohibiting the person who offers to make the contract from conditioning on the ground of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.288" offset="16405514">This Court however in upholding the 1964 is Civil Rights Act, for example, made it very clear that a person has no constitutional right to discriminate when Congress has said that patrons of a business establishment or another type of establishment may not be selected on the basis of race that this is not depriving individual of any constitutional rights, rights of due process or property or liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.296" offset="16533514">There is no deprivation of Fifth Amendment rights by Congress enacting this type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.497" offset="16558278">The argument has also been made here in the brief by Fairfax-Brewster School and it has been repeated again today that in enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1866, Congress did not intend or that there is legislative history which would indicate that Congress did not intend the Act to cover private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.152" offset="16648975">We submit that this is an erroneous reading of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.809" offset="16671545">We have discuss this in a -- this orange reply brief that we filed in the case where this issues had been raised, and we pointed out that there had been a clause that had been included in the original bill which prohibited that said there shall be no discrimination in Civil Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.143" offset="16748867">Some of the persons or principally Congressman Ben, for example, of Ohio, who objected to this language and there were many others who argued that this would have the effect of interfering with various state segregation laws, that the state imposed segregation of schools, juries etcetera, that they had at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.027" offset="16844475">He and others felt that -- that is Congressman Ben and others felt that the matter of discriminatory state action should be dealt with in another amendment to the Constitution and indeed at that time, the Fourteenth Amendment was then being drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.527" offset="16910408">And so consequently, when this language that is been referred to by the counsel for Fairfax-Brewster was the statements that were being made by Congressman Wilson where he said we do not intend this amendment to apply to schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.373" offset="16977804">They were really saying they did not think the proponents of the 1866 Act did not -- they were trying to save it from these attacks, and we are trying to say we do not intend this Act to nullify state discrimination laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.781" offset="17035483">There is no evidence at all that they had any reference, any intention to have their language refer to private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.759" offset="17079368">They were trying to say that, as I say, ultimately they agreed in the amendment that Congressman Ben was proposed which then eliminated this no discrimination in Civil Rights Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.413" offset="17137987">The Thirteenth Amendment was added by the 1866 Act enacted in its present form, and there has been no -- there is really no evidence in the legislative of history as to exactly what kind of contracts Congress really had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.559" offset="17206532">It is a very generalized language, the legislative history itself, it takes up many pages of the congressional globe of that era, but it released very little evidence, it provided very little evidence of exactly what Congress was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.980" offset="17272256">However, this Court has held and other courts have held that this phrase, “giving blacks the same right to make and enforce contracts as white citizens”, that this language is broad enough to cover employment contracts that it will cover contracts concerning the admission to amusement parks or admission tickets to amusement parks.</text>

            <text syncTime="4986.561" offset="20050536">I just really do not know the answer of that Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4992.308" offset="20073523">If I might proceed to as I said what seems to me the second crucial question in the case namely, whether there is any white, a reason for exempting privately-owned schools, non-public schools from the thrust of Section 1981?</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.931" offset="20164012">It seems to me this breaks down into two facets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.364" offset="20177804">The first -- in a two identifiable points here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.117" offset="20192746">The first one, it seems to me, concerns the matter of whether there is an institutional privacy that these schools can assert?</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.415" offset="20225974">And then secondly, whether there is a right of privacy, a personal privacy that the parents can assert on the behalf of their children or on behalf of their -- that is an expression of their right to raise and control the education of their children the way they wish too.</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.048" offset="20300475">With respect to the institutional privacy and the reason I break it down is because in the sense of Courts they come out -- it seems to me they come from two different frames of the law, of course two different lines of decisions, on the question to the institutional privacy and whether the schools are in fact selective and are, therefore, in position to ascertain this privacy and a right of exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.485" offset="20402248">I would point out first of all as the record shows that the schools, both of these schools advertised in the yellow pages, the phone book, that goes to defendant’s schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.623" offset="20434849">They have open enrolments, they solicit patrons, and enrolments in the community where they are located, and I would say in additions, the record does not show anything to the contrary so far as these schools that are represented by the Southern Independent Schools Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.278" offset="20509455">Indeed it is well-known that the reason these schools exist and are able to continue in existence is because they track and solicit or their enrolments are open, I should say, to everyone in communities where there was Court ordered desegregation of schools and that they have become and they have perpetuated because they have a constant in-flow of white students.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.549" offset="20602555">So as far as we know they are open to all white persons in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.863" offset="20619796">The Court in the Sullivan versus Little Hunting Park and in Tillman versus Wheaton-Haven Recreation Association says it had a much more difficult question before it, it seems to me in this regard, because there you were concerned with neighborhood swimming pools, recreation associations which really conform much more closely to the conventional concept of what is a private institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5152.651" offset="20714882">But the Court held in Sullivan case and it held in the Tillman case that those two associations were not “truly private” because they had no plan or purpose of exclusiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.206" offset="20765141">They were open to every white person in the areas they served.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.593" offset="20778725">They would be no selective element other than race.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.959" offset="20792204">Now, it seems to me that that language really covers the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.313" offset="20805579">They have no plan or purpose of exclusiveness any of these schools, then they are open to everyone in the communities or the areas that they serve and race is the only factor that constitutes an absolute bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.727" offset="20867228">Now of course they do have other selective characteristics but then so did the swimming pools in the Sullivan and Tillman cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.554" offset="20894500">The memberships in those schools, those associations were subject to approval of the board of directors and they had various other kinds of geographic and financial qualifications, but race became the absolute bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.570" offset="20946640">Now, again with respect to schools, government regulations of schools is a very common thing, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist mentioned earlier in the course of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5224.738" offset="21003274">There are state regulations that have been in existence for years that govern such matters as curriculum teacher qualifications and various others in academic standards, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.476" offset="21042248">Now the other very important and very significant thing is that in 1972 Congress, as we noted in our brief, Congress amended Title VII of the Fair Employment Provisions of the Civil Rights Act of the 1964 to apply them to private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.925" offset="21128034">There had originally been exemption for Educational Institutions in Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.927" offset="21144021">The Congress repealed that in 1972 and made Title VII applicable to private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.283" offset="21169412">Now it would certainly be in Congress, in the extreme for the Court to say that these schools could apply racial criteria in their selection of students, but the Congress at the same time said that they may not use race as a criteria in selecting faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.716" offset="21243182">If any school has 15 or more employees, they are subject to Title VII of Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.245" offset="21261259">That is an important to consideration to be borne in mind and in considering the issue here, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.632" offset="21286859">I would also point out that and this we have in our brief, there are 16 states that have non-discrimination education laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.528" offset="21330431">16 states that have adapted laws which prohibit discrimination in admissions policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.844" offset="21363659">Many of these, a number of these are modeled, are fashioned after a model law that has been promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.400" offset="21409948">So obviously it would be a surprise to the persons who drafted those laws and legislatures that have been enacted them for the Court to say that it is unconstitutional to somehow prohibit schools from discriminating on the basis of race.T</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.918" offset="21475985">hat would of course be -- that, of course, would be the effect of a holding against the plaintiffs in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5377.330" offset="21613598">Now, the next facet of the constitutional argument is the one I eluded to earlier which is I think what is really involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.110" offset="21652782">There have been references made by opposing counsel to right of association and the freedom of persons to express their beliefs and right to privacy and so forth, which I do not think quite hit the real issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5404.037" offset="21720492">It seems to me that the proper term was, an appropriate term, let us say, an aped term was used by Professor Louis Henkin, and we do not refer to this in our brief but there is an interesting article by Professor Louis Henkin at 74 Columbia Law Review, at Page 1410 in which he refers to autonomy as being an accurate, perhaps description of what this Court has talked about in some of its privacy cases that what we really are talking about here perhaps is the matter of familiar autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.318" offset="21889556">I am saying this because I wanted to make clear, I think it might be helpful frame of reference for the Court in its analysis of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.623" offset="21934800">The cases from which the right of privacy flows which have been the basis for the constitutional right of privacy as it has been explicated by the Court of course are Griswold versus Connecticut, Eisenstadt v. Baird, Stanley versus Georgia, and Roe v. Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.959" offset="22020168">Those are the basically the privacy cases, they deal with such matters as marriage, procreation, contraception what are essentially family relationships, but they are not all really privacy, they do not involve a necessarily an invasion of privacy so much as they involve the state’s interference with the ability to act freely, and according to one’s own personal dictates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.117" offset="22156841">Now, added to that line of cases are the other two cases which the court has frequently referred to Pierce versus Society of Sisters and Meyer versus Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.555" offset="22218594">Pierce versus Society of Sisters of course was a situation where the state had said that in effect private schools could not exist; all persons had to send their children to public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.655" offset="22270944">And Meyer versus Nebraska of course was an attempt to restrict the teaching of foreign languages in private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.989" offset="22304276">And those cases are the essence sort of basis I should say of what has been referred to as the right to liberty of the persons to direct the education in upbringing of their own children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.053" offset="22356521">Now, we do not, in any way, dispute this that this right exists, we could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.188" offset="22393092">However in the case of the Norwood versus Harrison Mr. Chief Justice Burger writing the opinion referred to the Pierce case for example and at Page 461 of the Court’s opinion in Norwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.623" offset="22462787">The opinion says, as Mr. Justice White observed in his concurring opinion in the Yoder, Pierce held simply that while a state may posit educational standards, it may not preempt the educational process by requiring children to attend public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.956" offset="22532168">And that is exactly the point in Pierce and in Meyer versus Nebraska the Court said very clearly that the state through its police powers has a right to posit educational standards and other kinds of regulations that are necessary to control the manner in which schools are operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.321" offset="22617641">Now parents do not have complete autonomy in how they raise their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.552" offset="22638539">This is and its well ingrained at our legal system today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.651" offset="22650973">Compulsory school laws have been upheld everywhere that they have been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.635" offset="22674901">Parents have objected to compulsory school laws on religious and constitutional grounds, but they have never been successfully challenged that is such laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="5659.431" offset="22742088">I do not believe so Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.746" offset="22751283">The other case which is an important one to bear in mind is Prince versus Massachusetts where a person used a child for the purpose of selling religious tracks and the State of Massachusetts prosecuted the parent on the ground that it is the violation of the State Child Labor Law and this Court held that notwithstanding the very sacred right, if you will, of the parent to control the child’s activity and to particularly there where the child was being used in a religious way or as an expression of religious belief that notwithstanding the importance in the high priority given these rights, the state still had a legitimate interest and the right to control a child’s upbringing and interfere -- I do not mean totally upbringing but to require the parent to abide by the child labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5726.163" offset="23008955">The Court said that the state had has a wide range of power for limiting parental freedom and authority and things affecting the child’s welfare and this includes to some extents, matters of conscience and religious conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.722" offset="23059215">So we submit that notwithstanding the expressions of conscience, the expressions of that we have heard here about beliefs and segregated education is the superiority form of education that the state here may legitimately in a constitutional sense tell parents that if you are going to send your child to school and you will require to by the Compulsory Education Laws, they have to go to schools under the conditions that we, state have found to be most appropriate in a democratic society.</text>
            <text syncTime="5774.826" offset="23203620">I would just, in closing, would like to add one word and that is that -- I think it is very significant that we have in this case the support of the Solicitor General of the United States and also the counsel for American Private Education, the National Association of Independent Schools and the Southern Association of Independent Schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.938" offset="23288047">This comprises the majority of the educational industry, if you will in the United States and they have a saying to this Court that they do not believe that the Court’s affirmance of the courts below would interfere with the way they operate the schools whether they will interfere, it will interfere with the right of parents who send their children to those schools to control the education of their children unduly.</text>

            <text syncTime="5838.497" offset="23458261">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5841.041" offset="23468501">There are two additional issues which i would like to address this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.034" offset="23484488">The first concern is the award of attorney’s fees in this case are the District Court which is subsequently reversed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5852.486" offset="23514268">The second involves the appropriate statute of limitations to be applied to a 1981 action brought in the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.634" offset="23542898">The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in this case applied a two-year personal injury statute of limitations and petitioners seek to apply the five-year statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5870.921" offset="23588038">Turning first to the question of attorney’s fees, we submit that there are two bases under which attorney’s fees could appropriately be supported as an award in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.158" offset="23628998">The first involves the application of the bad faith exception of the American Rule and the second involves a finding of an explicit statutory authorization to award fees of the Section 1988 of 42 U.S. Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5895.040" offset="23684482">Before discussing the attorney fee issue, however, in detail with these theories, I would like to note briefly the matter in which the attorney fee question was raised in the course of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5905.991" offset="23728263">We take it is quite important to note that in this case the District Court at the conclusion of the trial awarded $2,000.00 in attorney’s fees without however hearing argument on this question and without making any specific findings as to the basis for the awarded fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.715" offset="23791166">It is also of course, important to note that case arose before this Court’s decision in Alyeska.</text>
            <text syncTime="5928.297" offset="23817497">On appeal, only the Private Attorney General theory was brief and argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="5933.650" offset="23838918">Subsequently in the Fourth Circuit’s opinion on this case, the Private Attorney General theory was held in applicable and by 4:3 margin the Court of Appeals found that no bad faith was present on the record before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.102" offset="23892730">I would think possibly important to the Court was the absence of any findings of bad faith, it made explicitly by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.977" offset="23924181">We would note however that the general pattern which has been seen in cases considered by Circuit Courts since this Court’s decision in Alyeska has seen remand to District Courts and circumstances where the Private Attorney General theory had been utilized to award fees, but no basis for bad faith had been explicitly recognized and discussed by Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.173" offset="24012998">We would therefore suggest that at a minimum in this case based on the record, a remand would be necessary and should this Court be unable to agree with our conclusions in the record that bad faith is amply been made out before the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="6002.848" offset="24115711">We believe that the bad faith in this case is constituted not by the defense by the schools of what they believe to be their constitutional rights to refuse admission to black students, but more by the matter in which they have asserted this defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.439" offset="24170046">Specifically by the repeated denials under oath of having it refused to admit these children on the basis of their race, the Court of Appeals has found it quite important in considering this question in finding and stating that they believe faults of perception and memory could have accounted for the testimony that was given on several occasions by the defendant’s witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6039.923" offset="24263982">We, however, submit that a review of a record of this case will show that there is no question of perception or memory in the conduct of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.289" offset="24301494">Quite the contrary is true in the case of the Gonzales children and the Fairfax-Brewster School in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="6055.817" offset="24327616">There was testimony by three members of the staff of that school that they remember fully the circumstances under which Colin Gonzales applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="6194.190" offset="24881099">However, we would note that in commenting on this testimony of three witnesses, the three administrator people from the Fairfax-Brewster School, the District Court explicitly found that the Court rejects this testimony as unbelievable and finds that the reason for the rejection was because Colin Gonzalez was Black.</text>

            <text syncTime="6417.378" offset="25773860">The second theory which we would like to submit to the Court justifies the award of attorney’s fees in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6423.282" offset="25797474">This is found in the examination of Section 1988 of 42 U.S. Code, the Section was originally the Third Section of the 1866 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6433.188" offset="25837076">We submit that 1988 provides for this Court the specific legislative guidance which after Alyeska appears to be required in order to find the authority to grant attorney’s fees absent one of the generally recognized exceptions to the American Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.370" offset="25905830">As this Court, I believe is familiar from its decisions in other case dealing with 1988, the language of that provisions speaks in terms of the jurisdiction of courts in Civil Rights cases being exercise in conformity with the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6464.667" offset="25962986">So far as such laws are suitable to carrying the same into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6468.126" offset="25976779">To the extent that those laws are not fully adapted, the Court may then look to state laws modified by Common Law as long as it is consistent with the Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6477.984" offset="26016276">We believe that this Section provides an explicit invitation to seek remedies to make fully effective to the 1866 Act, and in fact other Civil Rights provisions of Chapter 21 of 42 U.S.C. We would also like to submit and state that this Court has recognized the ability that it possesses to apply the 1866 Act, Section 1988 to draw a confederal law to make fully whole victims of discrimination in determining appropriate relief and remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6513.152" offset="26156919">And we would cite for that proposition the case of Sullivan versus Little Hunting Park in which the Court and I quote stated “as we read Section 1988, both federal and state rules on damages may be utilize whichever best serves the policies expressed in the federal statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6530.770" offset="26227450">We, therefore, suggest that it is inappropriate course for this Court to follow to draw upon the Private Attorney General provisions of later inactive statutes which allow for the award of attorney’s fees in Civil Rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.541" offset="26286487">We think, no less is required to fully effectuate the purposes of the 1866 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6555.529" offset="26326402">Finally, Your Honors I would like to turn my attention to the question of the statute limitations that had been applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6563.643" offset="26358898">The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals applied in this case, the two-year statute of limitations which is taken from the personal injury provisions of Virginia Code Section 8-24.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.985" offset="26412292">This Section which had first been applied in 1972 in the case of Almond versus Kent, that being a 1983 action involving a suit in which a citizen had been beaten allegedly by the police was in fact a personal injury case, a physical injury case as well as the constitutional case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6597.905" offset="26495989">The Court in that instance was choosing between the application of the two-year limit for personal injuries and a one-year limit based on transitory torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6607.726" offset="26535277">It chose in a way that was quite helpful to the plaintiff in that case a the two-year limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.409" offset="26557951">Subsequently, the logic applied in that case to 1983 action has been applied to Section 1981 and 1982 actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6622.869" offset="26595776">Although of course they do not involved necessarily and normally do not involved explicit physical injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="6650.506" offset="26706327">Precisely that is exactly the reason why we think neither 1981 nor 1982 nor 1983 action should be equated for purposes of analogy with the physical personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6661.220" offset="26749167">We would state here parenthetically that it is interesting to note that in Virginia, law application within the State of Virginia, that two-year limit to the best of our ability to research the question is only applied to the cases of physical bodily injury and there is no case that has been cited to us in opposing briefs or that we have been able to research which applies any place except in the area of Civil Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6686.733" offset="26851254">Now, it is for that reason that we think that in searching for the most analogous statute of limitations, which is of course the federal courts are obliged to take and federal statutes are silent on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6698.270" offset="26897438">The appropriate thing to do is to look at the Second Section of that Virginia Statute, which specifies that in personal actions for which no limit is otherwise prescribed, a five-year limit should be adapted if the cause of action is found to survive and a one-year limit is to be applied if the cause does not survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6716.589" offset="26970686">We would, applying that analysis, suggest that a five-year statute is dictated our virtual effect that even the opinion of the Fourth Circuit in Almond versus Kent in the first instance, there was no question but that the federal right under 1983, and we would suggest under 1981 and 1982 as well, would survive on the basis of generally accepted federal principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6742.091" offset="27072668">Because of that Your Honor, we suggest that the appropriate resolution of this case on the statute of limitations is to hold that for purposes of analogy in the State of Virginia, the five-year statute of limitations is the appropriate one to be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="6761.170" offset="27149050">The way this issue arises Mr. Justice Stewart is that in the case of the Gonzalez family the parents were not entitled to rule, not able to bring this case, because statute limitations has barred them, and they filed the suit three-and-a-half years approximately after the cause of action arose.</text>
