            <text syncTime="61.416" offset="349024">The instant case presents a challenge to the -- to a Mississippi statute governing the sale of milk in Mississippi by out-of-state processors and brand producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.742" offset="406284">My client, the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company operates a processing, milk processing plant in the State of Louisiana at which it processes milk for its stores in Louisiana and Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.633" offset="469814">A &amp; P also operates approximately 38 stores in the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.514" offset="501370">A &amp; P sought a permit from Mississippi, a certification from Mississippi for the right to sell its milk at its stores in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.325" offset="540658">The permit was refused on the basis that the statute in question requires that a certificate be attached to the application, certifying that the State, in this case Louisiana, would give reciprocity to Mississippi’s inspections of its milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.071" offset="623623">Basically, the statute says Your Honors that Mississippi will allow an out-of-state processor to sell its milk in Mississippi, if that company -- if the state, which inspects that company’s milk has standards and procedures that are substantially equivalent to those of Mississippi and if the milk receives at least a 90% rating under the public -- under an inspection administered by a Public Health Service certified officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.409" offset="764997">It further provides, and this is the portion of the statute which we claim to be unconstitutional, that the milk would be accepted only if the sending State gives reciprocity to Mississippi’s inspections and accepts its standards, also.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.532" offset="869487">Well Your Honor, just Section 11 is the -- is the only section that deals with out-of-state processors, which is -- well, in answer to your question, only Section 11 and only part of Section 11, the part that requires that the processor obtain a reciprocity agreement from the State in which its plant is located.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.992" offset="1003234">We feel that the statute in question is -- is a clearly a burden on Interstate Commerce and should be stricken for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.068" offset="1039597">After the permit was denied, A &amp; P filed suit in Mississippi in single judge court and asked for a temporary restraining order, this was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.978" offset="1095185">The company was given leave to amend and ask for a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.814" offset="1110545">The outcome of this eventually was that the three-judge court denied relief and this appeal followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.855" offset="1150774">Your Honors, Mississippi defends its statute by claiming that its reciprocity requirement is health-related and is not economic in nature and it seeks to avoid the rulings, the vast number of rulings by this Court striking down similar statutes governing regulation of milk, sale of milk, in which economic purposes were found.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.267" offset="1276370">We feel that logic shows that the statue, or at least the reciprocity provision can only be economic in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.000" offset="1319316">Mississippi says, “Well, if we get reciprocity from Louisiana, then we will accept their milk even though their standards are lower, if they will accept our milk.”</text>

            <text syncTime="477.965" offset="2015218">I do not believe that this case requires that.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.652" offset="2025876">I think that the cases that this Court has decided in the area of milk, regulation of milk by the states, make clear that a -- a State cannot interact an economic barrier against foreign competition, in consequence of its own local producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.301" offset="2100481">Furthermore, if -- if -- and we recognize that milk in these cases, have recognized that the regulation of milk is not the State’s interest and it is a matter of local concern, but if there are -- if there is a regulation that burdens commerce and there are alternative means available, which will be less of a burden, then the regulation must fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.683" offset="2202046">The Dean’s milk case mentioned that.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.475" offset="2217197">There is no question here that if the reciprocity requirement is not economically related -- is not related to the health, then they do not need it, there is no -- there is no reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.061" offset="2267561">The statute could stand without that requirement and Mississippi would get just as wholesome milk as it would with it and along these lines the -- the record reflects that four dairies in the Louisiana, four processors in Louisiana are at this time and have been exporting milk to Mississippi without a reciprocity agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.249" offset="2360348">Now, Mississippi has been unable to explain why they allow four processors to do this, but they would not allow A &amp; P to do it and this goes to the second part of our argument, that bearing on the equal protection claim, but I think it illustrates also that the reciprocity has absolutely nothing to do with wholesomeness of milk.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.982" offset="3331267">As I mentioned, we believe, although our principal argument is aimed at the Commerce Clause question that the record reflects that A &amp; P has been denied equal protection of the law.

            <text syncTime="994.756" offset="4082339">It has brought in milk from 16 diaries in 9 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.734" offset="4102297">It has worked, in short, under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.623" offset="4113791">Second, unlike the Baldwin versus Seelig line of cases in this Court, this regulation does not favor local producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.070" offset="4159557">It ensures merely parity of local producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.220" offset="4176171">That is to say, the reciprocity provision does have teeth, but it allows Mississippi producers to have access to the markets from which imported milk comes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2116.998" offset="8571326">Well, Your Honor, once again I am supposing because it was not developed in the record in this case, but once poses that when Section 11 was adopted, there were predecessor regulations of some sort, under which these companies in Louisiana qualified and I had never -- I do not get the constitutional implications, even from an equal protection standpoint of the Grandfather Clause treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.426" offset="8709043">In other words, there were rational reasons at the time for these dairies in Louisiana to come in and at the time Section 11 was adopted, it applied only looking forward and not backward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.650" offset="8761915">Now, access by this Grandfather Clause dairies is in one or two instances that I know of, merely local access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.601" offset="8793680">That is another reason why the regulations allowing Grandfather Clause treatment on a state wide statute of state wide import.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.501" offset="8829311">In other words, some of the dairies in Louisiana had access to merely three counties, of the coastal counties in the State of Mississippi adjacent to New Orleans, but it is largely undeveloped on this record and we say it is merely an after thought that its -- jurisdictionally is not proper in this Court and cannot be raised, except in the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.300" offset="8932547">Just briefly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.144" offset="8947907">As to the last matter raised, I think the record will show that the information as to the four other dairies -- processors came out during the testimony at the initial hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.461" offset="8997121">A&amp;P had no prior knowledge of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.853" offset="9006735">The matter or the issue as to equal protection was raised before the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.662" offset="9029931">It was briefed by the parties and the three-judge court, specifically ruled on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.011" offset="9051352">It is in their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.944" offset="9059084">They reasoned that they could not enjoin Mississippi in that practice because if they did, it might prevent Mississippi from later requiring reciprocity from the full processors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.404" offset="9112896">I do not exactly understand the reasoning, but they did rule on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.266" offset="9128361">I would just like to make a final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.852" offset="9138705">Counsel perhaps inadvertently, I am sure it was inadvertently, but he made the statement -- Louisiana makes a statement, in his jurisdictional statement, we are no Louisiana, we are A&amp;P and I think the whole case, as far as the defendant, appellee is concerned is that we are to be treated as though we are Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.782" offset="9218431">We are simply a processor in Louisiana trying to sell our milk in Mississippi and we feel the barriers erected by Mississippi to doing this are an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce and they should be stricken and we should be allowed a means of bringing our milk in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.775" offset="9302441">This is what the constitution requires and it is not sufficient, I submit to say, “Well, we are the good guys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.651" offset="9329921">We have the reciprocity and that is all we have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.628" offset="9341833">”That is not all he has to do and I submit that although their goals maybe laudable, the effect of the law is to lock us out and we submit that the law should be stricken.</text>
