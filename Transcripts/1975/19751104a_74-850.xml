            <text syncTime="34.396" offset="240863">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.679" offset="254028">This case presents the question whether the Federal Magistrates Act authorizes District Courts to refer all social security cases to United States Magistrates for review and recommendation of its decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.414" offset="308990">At issue is General Order No. 104-D of the Central District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.026" offset="331455">This District Court Rule requires all social security cases and many other federal cases to be referred to a magistrate for recommendation of a decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.455" offset="377117">In regard to social security cases, the rule requires the magistrate to review the administrative record, receive briefs, hear argument and submit a proposed decision to the District Judge together with the proposed opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.530" offset="433437">The Judge may adopt or reject the proposed decision taking whatever final action he deems appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.777" offset="462381">This specific case arose out of a social security claim by respondent Weber under the Medicare provisions of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.996" offset="495295">The secretary denied the claim and Weber sought judicial review in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.337" offset="516611">The District Court clerk referred the action to a magistrate under General Order No. 104-D.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.238" offset="540226">The Government’s motion to vacate the reference was denied by the District Judge, but on the Government’s motion, he certified his order for interlocutory appeal to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.452" offset="589127">The Ninth Circuit upheld the reference and General Order No. 104-D as within the authority of the Magistrates Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.765" offset="622355">This Court granted the Government’s petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.386" offset="636879">The respondent Weber does not take position on the Magistrate referral question, but the Ninth Circuit judge and he is being supported in this Court by the amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.977" offset="679197">The issue before this Court is whether General Order No. 104-D is authorized by the Magistrates Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.891" offset="710858">In other words, does the Magistrates Act permit or should have been construed to permit the referral by District Courts of all social security cases to Magistrates for a recommended decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.973" offset="767178">This issue is important not only to the judicial review of social security cases, but to judicial administration generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.111" offset="799778">If the Ninth Circuit decision is upheld by this Court, not only social security cases, but any case on the administrative record and perhaps all cases on motions for summary judgment or other dispositive motion could be referred to a Magistrate for recommendation of a decision on the merits under the authority of Magistrates Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.592" offset="893715">The Government’s position in this case in brief is that recommendatory procedure for deciding the merits of civil cases established by General Order No. 104-D was not authorized or intended by Congress when it enacted the 1968 Magistrates Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.354" offset="964768">We will show from the legislative history that the purpose of the Magistrates Act, the reason why Magistrates were created was to relieve judges of minor or ancillary functions, so that the judges would have more time for the careful performance of their adjudicatory duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.834" offset="1038642">Our main point is that Congress intended in this Act to give a Magistrates limited or ancillary duties, not a central rule in the adjudication of civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.867" offset="1082737">On this basis, the Government will urge that dispositive motions in civil cases should generally not be referred to Magistrates, but that non-dispositive motions may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.175" offset="1127981">Initially, we wished to note that we share the judiciary’s concern with the tremendous case vote on District Courts created by just the number of cases that are filed every year, including social security cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.714" offset="1194123">Our position is not that Congress cannot deal more effectively with this problem by statute, including the sound use of Magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.145" offset="1231844">Congress could enact a statute which in terms would authorize Magistrates to review and recommend the decision in social security cases or dispositive motions generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.170" offset="1275938">Our position is simply that Congress did not authorize such an important and far reaching judicial procedure when it enacted the 1968 Magistrates Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.884" offset="1394848">I do not believe because of the actual decision at least on the basis of the experience we had so far under these types of rules, it is rather that we feel that the procedure is not authorized by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.020" offset="1439361">That if Congress wants this kind of procedure it should enact a statute which would authorize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.065" offset="1459527">It is more a question of whether it is legal rather than a specific interest on how the cases are decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.867" offset="1758786">There would be a question about -- a question of the validity of judgments which are obtained under this type of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.838" offset="1786685">We do not think that any ruling of the practices unauthorized though should result in a retrospective decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.471" offset="1817196">We think it should be clarified at the earliest possible time what does a magistrates Act means in this regard?</text>
            <text syncTime="436.139" offset="1847811">Now, our reasons for a limited construction of magistrates Acts are necessarily based on the language, legislative history and purpose of Magistrates Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.208" offset="1888144">Now, in terms of some perspective I would like to point out that the major purpose of the Magistrates Act was to invest magistrates with specific and limited duties in the criminal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.760" offset="1938299">Under Section 636 (a) of the Act in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, magistrates are authorized among other things to conduct preliminary hearings in criminal cases, issue search and arrest warrants and pose conditions are released and exercise jurisdiction over minor criminal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.158" offset="2007890">The legislative history of the Act deals primarily with the functions of magistrates in the criminal area and statistics of the administrative office show that of 255,000 matters disposed off by magistrates in the last fiscal year, over 85% were in the criminal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.160" offset="2083958">The remaining 15% of matters disposed of by magistrates were in the civil area and were composed of chiefly of handling of pretrial conferences and prisoner petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.262" offset="2128366">These numbered 17,000 and 8,000 respectively in the last fiscal year.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.307" offset="2204539">yes sir, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.453" offset="2213107">S 1283 is presently under consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.795" offset="2230453">It was reported fairly by the subcommittee on judicial improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.681" offset="2249992">If that Bill as reported by the subcommittee is enacted, this case would become academic, if it is enacted because it would specifically authorize dispositive motions to be annulled by magistrates for a recommended decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.458" offset="2321150">But a similar Bill, I understand was introduced in the House.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.185" offset="2436089">636 (b) does state that District Courts may assign the Magistrates such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.284" offset="2472451">Now, although this particular language taken along is capable of a broad construction, we interpret it in light of its context in the legislative history and the purpose of the Act as reflecting limitations and it concerned the constitutional doubts or impediments be avoided.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.749" offset="2578299">Well, the language itself thus say that it cannot be inconsistent with the constitution or the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.231" offset="2612258">Now, that itself we feel merely reflects a conscious desire by the Congress to limit it certainly to those two aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.552" offset="2649561">Now, the Senate report explains this language -- it explains of the constitutional qualification in Section 636 (b) at Senate report number 371, not in terms of an affirmative for maximal grant of power to District Courts, but in terms of a prohibition and a safeguard against potential abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.712" offset="2730123">So we believe that the language was put in more for the purpose of safeguarding abuses rather than to extend maximal authority to District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.349" offset="2768680">The use of the term “in addition to such duties” rather than all duties or any duties, again suggests a limited statutory intention rather than a maximal statutory intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.638" offset="2817894">The amicus interprets 636 (b) as affirmatively authorized in maximal use of Magistrates to the full extent possible under the Constitution and statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.256" offset="2856347">But we question whether Congress would have left any statutory limitation if it had really intended to authorize a maximal grant of authority would more likely have said, we think not withstanding any statute to the contrary, if it intended to exercise maximal power in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.311" offset="2936595">The context of Section 636 (b) bears out we believe a limited statutory intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.829" offset="2962613">Three examples of civil duties are mentioned in Section 636 (b) and these examples are limited in scope and nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.329" offset="2992601">Now, the examples are not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.235" offset="3000229">We recognize that, but they are expressly described in the Senate report as intended to illustrate the general character of duties assignable to magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.044" offset="3047458">The three examples authorize reference to magistrates of special master functions under the restrictions of Rule 53, assistance to the judge in pretrial and discovery proceedings and making recommendations as to whether there should be a hearing in Habeas Corpus cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="953.521" offset="3917336">But there the distinction would be the other part of what Representative Poff said that the judge, the point of relieving judges of the minor burdens would be so that judges would have more time to devote to the actual substance of litigation -- to the actual of decision of cases and I think that that was the thrust to make this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.822" offset="3998629">The Senator Tydings, who was the chief sponsor of the Act, he explained at page 73 that he went so far to say it was intended, 636 (b) to relieve judges of some of the routine non-judicial burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.495" offset="4057248">I actually would not call this acting on discovery motions non-judicial, but the point is the lesser type of problems that used to face judges all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.272" offset="4092356">He also emphasized that District Judges should be able as the result this Act, devote more time to the actual writing of opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.203" offset="4120151">Now, the Senate report number 371 is probably the most informative statement of Congress of what it is intent was in enacting this additional civil duties provision in Section 636 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.887" offset="4170828">The report does not state that Congress intended to confer a full or maximal power to District Courts to invest Magistrates with several jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.467" offset="4209176">The reports based generally of relieving District judges of some of their minor burdens and of culling from a District Judge’s workload, matters that are more desirably performed by a lower tier of judicial officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.128" offset="4255778">The report further explained that the reason why Congress authorized flexibility in the assignment of additional civil duties to magistrates that is not limited to the three examples was not to relieve judges of their adjudicatory responsibilities, but precisely the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.431" offset="4320980">So that there would be increased time available to judges for the careful and unhurried performance of their vital and traditional adjudicatory duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.815" offset="4354521">Now, one of the vital and traditional adjudicatory duties of judges is that judicial review of administrative record cases under the substantial evidence standard, including social security cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.334" offset="4404676">Justice Frankfurter’s opinion in the Universal Camera case on the responsibility of judges to review the whole record in substantial evidence cases demonstrates that decision of these cases is not simply ministerial as the amicus asserts in its brief, but requires delicate judicial judgment and a first hand evaluation of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.303" offset="4492552">If a judge contentiously performs this task in a social security case, including unnecessary review and evaluation of the administrative record, it appears he would be duplicating the work performed by a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.054" offset="4547514">If he does not, it appears that he would not be exercising the adjudicatory function which is expected of him under the Magistrates Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.302" offset="4576562">Either way the practice which is authorized by this District Court rule seems to be inconsistent with the purpose of the Magistrates Act to relieve District judges of non-essential functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.467" offset="4625150">The dilemma created by this procedure was spotted by Judge Sprecher in the decision, TPO versus McMillen in which he stated, we do not think situations of this kind would be remedied by the magistrate simply recommending to the District Judge instead of adjudicating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.458" offset="4697143">We believe that on the basis of the legislative history as I say that there is a limited intention by Congress not to transfer the actual major responsibility in deciding civil cases to magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.845" offset="4742701">Now, what Congress did though in the Magistrates Act in the first example, that is Section 636 (b) (1) was to actually authorize magistrates to make a review and recommend decisions as a special master, that is under Rule 53.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.405" offset="4816889">This is the only place where Congress and anywhere focused on this kind of a role for magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.260" offset="4844370">But Rule 53 limits the reference of civil case to special masters to exceptional cases whether detailed matters of account or some exceptional condition requires, if it is meant to be the exception of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.836" offset="4902675">So this particular authority which certainly not authorizes a blanket reference of all social security cases to the magistrate as this General Order No. 104-D calls for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.262" offset="4956383">We realized that in general or traditionally the references to masters has been generally in cases involving fact finding functions, but we do think that Rule 53 is limited just to fact-finding type of cases or cases involving factual disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.338" offset="5024614">We think that Rule 53 concepts involves reference of any kind of a civil case to a master or hear a magistrate as master before he recommends a decision on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.375" offset="5768791">Well, in our petition we did introduce some statistics which intended to show what the actual practice was and I admit that they were not very widely based statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.455" offset="5817170">But all I can say is that from my own knowledge that the judge does not usually schedule a complete new round of proceedings before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.382" offset="5852801">In fact there is a great deal of opposition to that suggestion expressed by many commentators and judges because they feel that would definitely eliminate the use of the magistrate which is to relieve judges of this type of additional workload.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.217" offset="5920196">We think that even it were cast in the form of a recommendation, Congress did not contemplate this major type of role for magistrates and specially without -- not only saying so in the statute, but not even mentioning it in the legislative history that covered the statute and the legislative history as I indicated, seem to indicate just minor functions were intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.199" offset="6012147">Now, where Congress has authorized officials other than judges to exercise significant adjudicatory functions in the District Courts it has expressly said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.354" offset="6052690">Examples of course would be the referee in bankruptcy, masters and Court of Claims Commissioners where these duties are spelled out at clear terms of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.677" offset="6321960">The quality of the function is probably about the same, but the point I was trying to make with example of referees in bankruptcy is that where Congress intends such a major role, I think in the official in question, it is spells it out and it has with referees in bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.036" offset="6487472">Well, I think Your Honor that whether it is just bankruptcy or whether it all civil cases, both require that there be some definition by Congress to whether its intent -- the official in fact more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.330" offset="6536582">In fact, in a case where a magistrate can exercise a significant adjudicatory role on a whole broad category of litigation that Congress at least should indicate this that this is purpose as intended in words in the statute and in turn in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.849" offset="6610665">Now, we agree that transferring to magistrates the work of initial review of social security cases may additionally lighten the workload of District Judges, and we also do not doubt that this may have benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.306" offset="6668552">But we think a question of policy is involved, although the review of these cases should be transferred to magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.184" offset="6696033">We do not think Congress went that far when it enacted the 1968 Act and at best it enacted a general and an ambiguous provision which simply did not come to grips with this particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.109" offset="6743785">If Congress wishes to establish authority for Magistrates to act in this capacity, it should consider the problem and enact the statute in clear terms which would authorize it if it thinks it is sound practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.054" offset="6859560">Well I think the wisdom enters into it in this way that it is a matter where a policy question is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.383" offset="6892787">If it is in a statute some reflection of that policy should be shown either in the statutory language or in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.075" offset="6919641">It is not shown in regard of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.952" offset="6927060">So this Court, it seems to me should differ to Congress and let it specifically think what it wants done with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.616" offset="6953810">Now, Congress actually as I mentioned before has a Bill before it which would solve this problem and it would authorize magistrates to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.268" offset="6980350">I do not know whether that Bill that will be accepted or rejected and in the circumstances I do not think that the Court should assume that Congress has already authorized the procedure in this genuine and guarded measure that it enacted in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.447" offset="7045134">Now, in sum we would urge the Court to adapt an interpretation of the Magistrates Act which would clarify three things respecting civil jurisdiction of magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.181" offset="7087974">First, that the Act does not permit the reference to magistrates, the merits of civil litigation, including dispositive motions, except under the restrictions of Rule 53.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.153" offset="7123919">Second, that the Act would permit the reference of most preliminary procedural or non-dispositive motions to magistrates for review and initial ruling and finally any ministerial matter could be referred to a magistrate for final action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.485" offset="7185254">Now, in social security cases this would mean that the judge have to decide himself with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.378" offset="7208765">The magistrates would still have though a great deal of authority to relieve the burden on District judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="1987.649" offset="8053878">The Government has conceded that the general order adopted by the District Court does comport with constitutional requirements so there is no further need for us to debate that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.735" offset="8106227">I agree with the Government that this kind of a procedure is authorized by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.141" offset="8131827">We are, therefore, limited to a discussion of whether the Magistrates Act by its terms authorizes the kind of procedure which the District Court adopted and which the Court of Appeals affirmed and in that connection, I will discuss three points.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.987" offset="8279263">This concerns the review of the determination by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare that Mr. Weber is not entitled to a Medicare payment and that decision is to be reviewed with the view of determining whether the decision is based upon substantial evidence in a closed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.532" offset="8377378">There is no need, no opportunity, no right on the part of either the secretary or Mr. Weber to introduce new evidence, to bring witnesses before the Court, no right of any of them to do anything other than present legal arguments based upon that closed record as to whether substantial evidence exists in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.121" offset="9355821">There was a situation in which the magistrate was being asked to hear witnesses, to make crucial factual determinations in the habeas corpus context and the Court said that that could not be reconciled with the express language of the Habeas Corpus Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2372.720" offset="9594162">The fact that in the overwhelming number of cases, the district judges do accept the magistrate's disposition, I suggest is not an adverse reflection on the district judges that they are thereby abdicating their duty, but I would hope a reflection of the adequacy of the service being rendered by the magistrates and in fact there are a few cases that I have cited in my brief in which District Courts have disregarded or changed the recommended disposition urged by the magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.550" offset="9717460">Well, the importance of this procedure, I think is highlighted by the administrative office of the Court's Fiscal Year 1975 Report.</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.103" offset="9827697">There are some in areas where there are coal mines in particular where black loan cases apparently have generated something like 559 Social Security Act cases in West Virginia and in Kentucky as well 800, in West Virginia 500 and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.613" offset="9897705">There is a great concentration of those at the present time in those jurisdictions, but even we are talking -- whether we are talking about the Central District of California which is the jurisdiction from which this case arose, Los Angeles, 78 Social Security Act cases were brought in that District Court and referred to magistrates during the Fiscal Year 1975.</text>

            <text syncTime="2568.267" offset="10376373">Now, it is precisely the routine case that is the kind of a case that the magistrates can appropriately look at by reviewing a closed record and that Rule 53 was addressing a wholly different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.329" offset="10436663">That is the exceptional case where the court needs assistance from some outsider and I think that Rule 53 when it said that only the exceptional case may be referred was drafted as it was to avoid the abdication by judges of important adjudicatory functions in difficult cases where they did not wanted to assign or felt that their dockets were too crowded and the legislative history of this Act clearly indicates that the Congress recognized the validity of the La Buy versus Howes Leather case here that reference as to the masters were to be restricted to the truly exceptional case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2640.651" offset="10665914">The concept that was expressed certainly has a long tradition and there was hostility to references to masters even preceding the La Buy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.417" offset="10728921">As we have said earlier, the language of the Magistrates Act is not as clear as it might be with respect to the additional duties that a magistrate may perform, but I would like to just briefly touch on one point that Government counsel made for the first time in his argument here which concerns the use of the words such additional duties which he had suggested is somehow a limitation on the duties of the magistrate because it would refer to the three illustrative subsections of Section B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.657" offset="10861937">And looking at Section 636 of the Magistrates Act as a whole, I note that Section 636 (a) indicates that the magistrate serving under this chapter shall have the following duties, including those that had traditionally been performed by United State’s Commissioners and the power to administer oaths and the power to conduct trials in petty criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.355" offset="10960680">636 (b) then goes on to say that the District Courts may by rule established, assign such additional duties as maybe specially designated and I believe the use of the word “such additional duties” flows from additional to subsection (a) rather than being a reflection of the examples that are listed in the following portions of subsection (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.525" offset="11081365">What light does the legislative history shed on this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.679" offset="11109996">I have suggested in my brief that not only does a legislative history reflect a desire on the part of the draftsman of this legislation, Senator Tydings, Representative Poff and others to provide as wide ranging a use of magistrate as is consistent with the constitution and with statutory law, but that the Judicial Conference of the United States which actively supported this legislation with the limitations that are now contained in subsection (b) and which has supported this legislation ever since has always interpreted it to include precisely this kind of service by magistrates and a subsequent Act of Congress raising the salaries of magistrates, specifically referred with approval to the duties performed by magistrates in reviewing social security cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.607" offset="11349695">And I do not say that subsequent legislative history is infallible or the most appropriate guide at all to what a previous Congress meant, but I do cite it to show that it is not in anyway inconsistent with a continuum of legislative intent that magistrates be dignified as powered judges of the District Courts able to assist judges in performing duties such as those that perhaps not dogs, but in any event of a routine character which would enable the District judges to reserve their time and attention to other matters more serious perhaps.</text>
