            <text syncTime="7.292" offset="132512">Mr. Chief Justice and May I please the Court, Good morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.037" offset="151424">Just prior to yesterday’s recess, I was discussing this Court’s decision in Daniels versus Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.849" offset="174726">which held Taylor versus Louisiana not retroactive and in particular, that part of the Daniels case dealing with the effect upon the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.350" offset="212655">If Taylor were held to be retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.010" offset="223313">Ross’s contention is that the retroactive application of Ham, no doubt will some effect on the criminal justice system within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.997" offset="263333">But not the calamitous effect, urged on this Court by the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.339" offset="288619">We also suggest that the decision of the First Circuit in Ross does not have the wide ramification suggested by the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.152" offset="319966">Yesterday, I mentioned the couple of those limitations, but one that I would like to mention now and what triggers the Ross Doctrine in asking questions as to racial prejudice is that the Defense Counsel must submit questions to the Trial Judge to ask the perspective Jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.660" offset="389975">Failure to do that and failure of the Trial Judge to refuse those questions, or similar questions to the same effect, will not bring the Doctrine in Ham or Ross into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.140" offset="439816">Also, as a practical matter, in order to challenge one’s conviction based upon the Ham case, a criminal Defendant probably would still have to be in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.078" offset="487568">There has been -- 36 months have pass since the Ham decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.422" offset="501047">Presumably, all States except Massachusetts has followed the Ham decision and even in Massachusetts, in the second Ross decision, the Supreme Judicial Court although affirming Ross’s conviction said that in future cases, it is good policy to ask these questions as to racial prejudice, although not constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.152" offset="603865">And in addition, the legislature of Massachusetts has twice, since the second Ross decision in May of 1973 revise the statute upon which this suit is predicated to for now provide that the Trial Judge must ask or shall ask, questions as to racial prejudice to the perspective jurors.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.541" offset="3385488">Yes, except the language that I have quoted in some papers in front of me.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.918" offset="3402938">It says that the Aldrich conviction relied on -- the Ham conviction was relying on the firmly established precedented Aldrich, and the numerous State cases upon which it rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.152" offset="3447868">And, I took that to mean that—</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael G. West</label>
            <text syncTime="838.738" offset="3458213">It was from the Ham case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.973" offset="3491232">If I can have a moment later on, if you would like, I could find the exact language, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.613" offset="3529788">If I can continue?</text>
            <text syncTime="859.760" offset="3542327">The point I was trying to make is that this Court does not have to reach the issue of the impact on the criminal justice system to Massachusetts or the good faith reliance on prior precedent because the issue in Ham goes precisely to the truth finding function of the Jury and errand the suspect, Ross’s conviction and therefore according to the William’s case, would invoke the retrospective application of Ham, without regard to good faith reliance and effect on the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.508" offset="3681299">We are here dealing not with an exclusion of evidence case or an illegal search and seizure case, which this Court has generally not held to be retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.953" offset="3715153">But, we are dealing with the case which shows the possibility, the probability, the likelihood that the Ross jury acted in arbitrary way, not based upon the evidence and but rather based upon the race of Mr. Ross, and the conviction resulted there from.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.136" offset="3779832">The purpose of applying Ham retroactively would be to guarantee an accused a totally fair and impartial tribunal, and, to protect the integrity and dignity of the judicial process, from any hint of bias or prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.931" offset="3843049">Ross was not afforded either of these protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.370" offset="3856737">The duty that the Court’s of the Commonwealth to Massachusetts owes the James Ross Jr. requires no less.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.170" offset="3887979">If I can move on to the issue of the applicability of Ham to Ross, Ham as you know, was a case involving the possession of Marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.987" offset="3927268">The Trial Judge was asked two question to ask the perspective Jurors two questions, he refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.736" offset="3950255">And, ask only those general questions provided in the South Carolina statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.591" offset="3977632">This Court said that the missing element in the Ham decision was that the Court did not focus the attention of the perspective Jurors as to any racial prejudice they might entertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.622" offset="4029772">And, I would suggest to this Court that that is also the missing element in the Ross case.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.853" offset="4050670">The Ham case and the Ross case are most similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.194" offset="4060074">Each involved the black defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.311" offset="4068538">In each the principal witness was a Police Officer or Quasi Police Official.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.230" offset="4088182">In the Ross case, he was a Security Officer, dressed in the Boston Patrolman’s uniform, patrolling Boston University.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.292" offset="4120469">In order to be found guilty, both Ham and Ross needed the unanimous verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.896" offset="4142935">Each final Jury was composed of 10 whites and 2 blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.407" offset="4164982">The statutes upon which each State operates is almost identical, asking the same questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.094" offset="4187656">The procedure in each State is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.146" offset="4203852">So, even wide discretion to the Trial Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.788" offset="4214510">And in each case, two Jurors were excused because of racial prejudice, in the Ham case and the Ross case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.329" offset="4252649">And finally, each question that was presented to this Court for decision in the cert petitions filed by Ross and Ham were almost identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.943" offset="4295072">Aldrich was a case whose facts are strikingly similar to Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.837" offset="4318686">The Ham case relied I think heavily on Aldrich and affirmed Aldrich, and I think the significance of the Ham case was that it reaffirmed Aldrich and gave it explicit constitutional underpinnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.581" offset="4385664">Ross asserts that the trial judge failure to ask specific questions as to racial prejudice is not only constitutional error, but requires reversal without the need to show actual prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.101" offset="4431744">It is twistic logic as the Commonwealth asserts that on the one hand, Ross was not entitled to have these questions asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.316" offset="4464554">But on the other hand, he must show actual prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.091" offset="4479705">One wonders how a criminal defendant can show actual prejudice without being able to ask questions of perspective jurors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1102.918" offset="4515023">I meant the reversal of this conviction and affirmance of the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.925" offset="4539055">Can the Commonwealth assure James Ross, that any error here was harmless beyond the reasonable doubt?</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.492" offset="4561312">Can the Commonwealth assure this Court that not one of the jurors chosen, harbored any prejudice against Ross because of his race?</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.963" offset="4591196">We can not, especially because of the conclusions, reached by the Kerner Commission and the recent events concerning racial segregation and integration in Boston, even if one the 12 jurors were prejudiced against Ross, his right to a fair trial was impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.870" offset="4670817">Seemingly in recognition of the difficulty of criminal defendants to show actual prejudice, this Court on several occasions has dispensed with this requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.635" offset="4713867">In Aldrich, and in Ham, in Peter versus Kiff, the Court said more over, if there is no showing of actual bias in the tribunal, this Court has held, Due Process is denied by circumstances that create the likelihood or the appearance of bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.749" offset="4782308">Same result in Taylor versus Louisiana, the defendant there did not allege that the failure to have woman on the jury was actually prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.734" offset="4818252">In conclusion and summary, although Massachusetts abolished slavery in 1783, racism is still part of American life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.217" offset="4852211">So much so that the Kerner Commission report stated 1968 that race prejudice has shaped our history decisively in the past, and now threatens to do so again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.667" offset="4894007">One cannot doubt the validity of that part of the Kerner Commission report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.187" offset="4912084">Certainly, this Court in both Aldrich and Ham have recognized that problem and Ross asked that you do so again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.238" offset="4940296">Failure to afford James Ross, a new trial after struggling for over 5 years, and 7 appellate hearings is as stated so eloquently by Mr. Justice Marshall to see this Court’s decision in Ham versus South Carolina still born, and to write an epitaph for those essential demands of fairness, recognized by this Court over 40 years ago in Aldrich.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.265" offset="5040397">Thank you.</text>
