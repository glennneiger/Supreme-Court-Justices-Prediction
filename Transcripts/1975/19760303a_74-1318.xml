            <text syncTime="15.728" offset="166284">I am Schempp (ph) attorney from Indianola, Mississippi representing the petitioners, Drew Municipal Separate School District and the individuals, the Superintendent and the Board of Trustees of the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.695" offset="226157">The Court has, in this case, permitted divided argument for both petitioners and the respondents and I will speak first on behalf of the petitioners and Mr. Allain of Jackson, Mississippi will argue in rebuttal for the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.927" offset="298986">I think that it is important in this particular case to discuss the factual background against which the rule in question was adapted.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.827" offset="350604">The town of Drew, Mississippi is located in a rural area of the Mississippi delta in Sunflower County, Mississippi and according to the 1970 census, had a population of 2,574.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.766" offset="426359">The school district is comprised of the Town of Drew and some additional territory, added territory outside the town and within the County of Sunflower.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.902" offset="466901">The entire district has a population of approximately 5,000-6,000 residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.743" offset="498352">The school itself is divided into an elementary school, a junior high school and a high school in all 12 grades of approximately 1,200 students, 80% of which at the time of this litigation were Black, 20% White.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.181" offset="584034">It is a public school system in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.478" offset="605245">There are three separate schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.726" offset="610261">There is Hunter High School, Hunter Junior High School, and A.W. James Elementary School.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.772" offset="722379">The school system is fully integrated and the District Court so found in this particular case that it is fully integrated as to faculty, staff and students.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.270" offset="780370">During the school year 1971-1972, within this school system, there were 28 schoolgirl pregnancies, requiring those children 13-17 years of age to be forced to withdraw from school to give birth to children out of wedlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.133" offset="871903">In Sunflower County, Mississippi alone, the statistics in this record as introduced by the respondents as an exhibit, in the record and is incorporating the appendix, the statistics for 1971 show that of all live births in Sunflower County, Mississippi 35.2% were illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.899" offset="970960">Now, faced with this situation, the alarming rise in schoolgirl pregnancies, an alarming rate of illegitimate birth within the community and county, the superintendent after having learned of the fact that there were teachers within -- teacher's aides within his school system that were parents of children born out of wedlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.604" offset="1085794">Mr. Petty, the superintendent activated his rule, and I will discuss the rule in just a moment, which resulted in the non-rehiring of one of the respondents herein and the non-hiring of the other respondent herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.088" offset="1179730">Now, the rule has been much discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.813" offset="1186627">It was not a codified rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.244" offset="1200315">The rule was Mr. Petty’s and it was subsequently approved by the Board of Trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.597" offset="1229677">I would like to state what we feel and submit to the Court what constitutes the rule that no individual who is the natural parent of a child born out of wedlock may be employed in the Drew Schools as a teacher or a teacher aide or in any other position or capacity in direct contact with the students and that has a potential role model status.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.614" offset="1357781">The rule was to regulate the status and not the present morals of an individual seeking employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.809" offset="1414519">Now, the respondent, Rogers, was employed during the 1971-1972 school year as a teacher aide.</text>

            <text syncTime="661.266" offset="2748436">Going back to, and it may be helpful to the Court to give a little background on the respondents involved, the respondent, Rogers, who was employed and was in the employee of the school district from 1971 to 1972 school year, served as a teacher aide.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.189" offset="2816041">Now, teacher aides are not teachers as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.223" offset="2828266">They assist the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.981" offset="2835267">They have probably more direct contact with the students than the teachers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.330" offset="2864628">They go with the students to recess, to the cafeteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.712" offset="2886153">They assist them in different activities throughout the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.672" offset="2906006">The respondent Rogers, serving in this capacity, was single and had one child which, there is no question, there is no conflict of evidence to the fact that this child was born out of wedlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.212" offset="2960132">She was notified during the spring of 1972 that she would not be reemployed for the 1972-1973 school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.380" offset="2988867">At the time she was notified, she was pregnant with the second child and still was not married.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.704" offset="3014153">Now, the respondent, Andrews, made application for a teacher’s aide position in December of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.476" offset="3053232">Her application indicated that she was single and had no children when in fact she did have one minor child which was born out of wedlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.815" offset="3098581">A routine investigation into this individual’s qualifications for employment revealed that she did in fact have one child.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.589" offset="3141735">Now, I want to emphasize to the Court that no one was fired as a result of this policy, only not employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.745" offset="3186352">Now, in February 1973, this suit was filed in United States District Court not as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.508" offset="3221357">Hearings were held during March through May of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.283" offset="3240478">The suit was filed under 42 U.S.C. 1981, 1983 Title VI and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.240" offset="3572338">The District Court did not reach the issues of race or privacy that were urged upon it by the respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="907.231" offset="3732207">Now, it is of our position that given the factual background in this particular case that the rule has a rational basis for the purpose for which it was adapted and we submit to the Court that the purpose for which this rule was adapted was an attempt by the school district to curb an alarming rate of illegitimate births within the school population itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.053" offset="3855505">The respondents say that there were other methods to do this, but we submit this was the only way that the school district could handle this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.434" offset="3893017">There were other ways it could be augmented -- that could augment this policy, but as suggested by respondents, to give sex education is good, to provide contraceptive devices is good, but for the school district to give tacit approval to this status of parenthood out of wedlock of children that this permitting that to remain and this as a policy of their school district to permit these people to teach would undermine any of the method that they attempted to enact to curb this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.617" offset="4081830">It is our position that an individual in that status is an improper role model.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.490" offset="4113281">Now, the expert testimony is to the effect that teachers, and I think this Court has own record that teachers are in a very sensitive area in a classroom where young minds are molded and shaped for the future where ideals are instilled upon them, the morays of society and they are some moral overtones involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.214" offset="7548174">But, Your Honor, this becomes more evident when we look at certain factual statements and background that is evident in the Drew area and perhaps, I can explain this a little bit more clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.344" offset="7588717">There were more Back illegitimate children born in Drew, Mississippi for a five-year period from 1968-1971 than total White legitimate or illegitimate children born in the same period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.948" offset="7655172">80% of this school district is Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.332" offset="7668651">The facts that I have submitted to you in the supplemental brief clearly indicate that from the period 1968-1971, the number of Black faculty members at the Drew Municipal Separate School District which was desegregated by way of a Court Order, 15 years after Brown versus Board of Education, has decreased from 75% at the A.W. James Elementary School to 36%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.605" offset="7769797">The point which is evident is that this rule, by its operation, Your Honors, can only affect Black people and the reason why it can only effect Black people is because for every 47 -- 46 illegitimate children born in Drew Mississippi, only one is a black -- a White child, only one is a white child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.026" offset="7871466">This is a clear Gomillion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.410" offset="7884945">Gomillion is clearly applicable here because the state has created a social policy rather than municipal boundaries which can only affect Black people and as a consequence, only Black people will be affected by the rule’s operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1979.400" offset="8020886">The only individuals that have been stigmatized or eliminated from employment by this rule’s operation were five Black women and although the defendants in this cause have repeatedly made reference to the supposed right of individuals to bear children out of wedlock, I would like to state that it was 1868, before Black people in this country had the right to bear children in the wedlock and that is a clear consequence of the enactment of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.355" offset="8144707">I do not have to say anything about Dred Scott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.376" offset="8156828">It is clear in many places throughout this Country that, as Judge Timmy said in Dred Scott clearly, Black people had no rights which a White man was bound to expect and so, as a consequence of this rule’s operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.776" offset="8214401">The only individuals who will be clearly affected by the rule’s operation are Black people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.726" offset="8234254">It is an insurmountable final exclusion from employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.185" offset="8252018">“Thou shalt not work if thou have a child out of wedlock in Drew,” and there can be no more and no greater stigmatizing effect upon any person, particularly young Black women who went to college, he did not tell you that Katie Mae Andrews Peacock had a college degree but she worked nights in a factory in order to get to it and she had a child while she was still in high school and it was four years later when the rule was made evident to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.960" offset="8351179">If a Black woman struggles through high school, struggles through college, and then at the moment when she finally gets out of the circle of poverty is told that because she bore a child out of wedlock four years ago she cannot have a job, then indeed, the constitution is senseless to us and makes no possibility for any change.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.196" offset="8552112">However, there is no clear statement under Title IX that there is a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.368" offset="8572801">Additionally, under Title VII, I might note that at one time we did try to create this action via Title VII action, but in 1973 when the action was filed, the Title VII amendments had just been put into effect and to be actually honest about it, Your Honor, EEOC was not very sure as to whether or not we could continue with this cause of action or create a cause of action against the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.079" offset="8655662">Furthermore, there was a length of time problem involved in the enactment of Title VII and the period of time it takes a matter resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.421" offset="8688994">Also, Your Honor, the fact of the matter is that we have, here, two federal, excuse me, a Federal District Court and a Court of Appeals which ruled that the flagrant nature of the violation here was so evident that the Court granted injunctive relief within four months after the lawsuit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.786" offset="8750434">And finally, Your Honor, I would like to make note of the fact that in the Cohen case Mr. Justice Stewart made it absolutely clear that although in that particular factual circumstance, in footnote 8 -- in that particular factual circumstance it might be evident that all future cases would be governed by Title VII clearly as to these individual plaintiffs and respondents the Court could actually make a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.294" offset="8844475">And so, for all of those reasons, we ask that the nature of this flagrant constitutional violation be made evident.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.823" offset="13022604">Other statistics would show that also there is a White increase in the student body which is not, of course, before this Court, and therefore, we say to the Court that many variables had entered into this particular thing.</text>
