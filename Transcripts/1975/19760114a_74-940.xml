            <text syncTime="56.129" offset="327822">These two petitions here consolidated arose out of one case below in the United States District Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth Balcomb</label>
            <text syncTime="121.643" offset="589882">With this exception we have asked the clerk to distribute xerox copies of it upon which we have roughly superimposed the boundaries of Water Division Four, Five and Six to emphasize and illustrate some later discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.212" offset="648188">The entire geographic area of Colorado, West of the Continental Divide is tributary to the Colorado River and this of course includes that area in Water Division Number Seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.964" offset="699179">Since the 1971 decisions in this Court in Eagle County in Water Division Number Five, the United States has been improving upon its claims of all nature and from whatever source they might have been derived, including there Reserve Rights in Water Divisions Four, Five and Six and the Water Courts in those divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.540" offset="793533">They have not, however, done so to date in Water Division Number Seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.310" offset="816521">If the Court will remember, in 1969 the Colorado legislature abandoned the Water District method of adjudication of water, there are then some 70 Water Districts and established seven divisions for such purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.190" offset="872109">Each division embracing for practical purposes, major water sheds or major tributary water sheds to a major river.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.611" offset="905755">The 1969 Act in pertinent part is reproduced as Appendix C at page 42 of the petition for certiorari in 74-949 which is made by the state of Colorado and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.875" offset="970852">I have the feeling that neither in 1971 nor to date as the Solicitor General’s Office clearly understand the present Adjudicatory Statute in Colorado, that is the 1969 Act because it went into affect on July 1, 1969, the water course rope through business on a continuing basis as contrast to the previous law requiring an affirmative action of opening and adjudication in a particular Water District.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.567" offset="1097598">So the United States could have filed its claims in middle 1969 in Water Division Seven and certainly after this Court's decision in Eagle County in Water Division Five, could have been expected so to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.108" offset="1147754">Instead on November 14, 1972, United States filed what can only be denominated as a quiet Title Action in United States District Court for the District of Colorado, asserting the claims of the United States as to waters of the San Juan River, naming almost 1000 other users and unknown number of unknown persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.448" offset="1241167">The claims such as in Water District Four, Five and Six are varied and include national monuments, forest, appropriate rights under state Law and finally claims on behalf of the Southern Ute and Mountain Ute Indian Reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.322" offset="1300622">Very promptly thereafter in December of 1972 the United States was served pursuant to the McCarran Amendment in Water Division Number Seven proceedings where upon they filed claims, similar nature except as to the Indian claim, the Indian Reservation claims as to there rights on the Dolores River which is the other principal tributary arising in Water Division Seven to the Colorado River.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.459" offset="1405112">All petitioners here moved to dismiss the Federal Court action which the District Court did orally from the bench, referring specifically to the intent of McCarran and to the two previous unanimous decisions of this Court in Eagle County in Water Division Five.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.318" offset="1468642">The District Court found that it should apply comity and abstention because Colorado had a well defined and workable system relating to the questions at hand developed over 100 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.430" offset="1533007">The U.S. had been served and under McCarran that was all that was required, a point I think that was admitted on Monday in connection with the pupfish case by the Solicitor General’s Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.204" offset="1588178">The solution to be granted by the Federal Court would be piecemeal only and would result in a duality of adjudication within one Water Division.</text>

            <text syncTime="2885.593" offset="11645739">And it makes a great deal of sense for us to bring these claims affirmatively in the Federal Tribunal recognizing that we will ultimately integrate them into the state court proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2953.730" offset="11918248">Well, certainly that aspect of the McCarran Act, if you wish to reach, it does have to be decided because the matter is of tremendous importance to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.055" offset="11963597">Now, in this connection as one final point to be made aside from Public Law 280 which I have mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.409" offset="11988988">Even the most recent full-scale study of Indian Water Rights and National Water Rights channel, the National Water Commission report suggested that because of doubts over what the impact of McCarran Amendment was on Indian Rights, that really the Indian Rights ought to be adjudicated in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.360" offset="12064743">Now these are a body of -- this is a body of experts which is listening to all of the arguments about this question, and that body concludes that the Indian Rights should be adjudicated in a Federal Court, even if other rights are adjudicated in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.503" offset="12125347">Because of the Indians concern over being subjected to state court jurisdiction that shows two things not only the Indians concern but also the fact that you do not need to have every affirmative claim asserted in the same court as long as ultimately for purposes of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.728" offset="12186265">All of the adjudicated rights, the affirmatively adjudicated rights are integrated in a single proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.075" offset="12223672">Now the -- I do not think that it would serve any purpose to argue about the abstention doctrine. The traditional doctrine just does not apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.746" offset="12274349">We are not dealing with uncertain state law, which is what abstention is about; we are not dealing with constitutional questions; we are not dealing with an attempt to review a state administrative determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.935" offset="12323042">So we can put abstention aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.639" offset="12329834">Now that leaves us with comity but there is nothing in the comity doctrine that has ever been extended this far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.351" offset="12356687">You would have to find that somehow McCarran has a fallout a shadow around it that requires that the United States not be allowed to sue affirmatively.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.729" offset="12746225">In answer to one of the questions which related what happened to the Removal Provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.490" offset="12761272">In the original Act it was removed at the request of the Justice Department, and now the Justice Department is asking Congress to put it back in, because almost every case that they attempted to remove was filed in State Court initially, is bounced back where the Federal Court and one was just bounced back to the State Court by the New Mexico, United States District Court the other day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.175" offset="12852074">There is a copy of it in the back of our reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3196.551" offset="12889481">The Government is making a claim for water supposedly reserved in connection to the Naval Oil Shale Reservations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3213.103" offset="12955727">There was some attempt made in connection with the lease of tracts, Colorado A and Colorado B recently, as well as the Utah tract to say that there was a Water Right in connection with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.010" offset="12999404">And what Interior finally said was no, it is just like an oil and gas well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.940" offset="13015078">If you drill your own gas well and it water bong on public lands, it bongs to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.208" offset="13032109">And that is in all the leases and that is the way they interpreted the Oil Shale problems out on the regular public domain where the only limitation was a right to file claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.334" offset="13076622">I want to call the Court’s attention to the relief asked by the Government in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.190" offset="13100132">They want a Special Water Master which is not necessary; they want a Special Administrator to control the stream separate and apart from the state System, and they want every single property owner already in decree to be enjoined from violating the Federal Court decree when do we all ready have administrator system, a set up to take care of that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.334" offset="13200651">Now I do not know if I have made myself clear about the proposition that the Water Judge in Water Division Number 7 has jurisdiction over, simultaneous jurisdiction over both the San Juan and the Dolores Rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.003" offset="13251329">And that everybody on both the San Juan and the Dolores Rivers is bound by whatever he finally decides in connection with the Water Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.953" offset="13287169">And the consequences of this reflect itself as this Court is aware, at lee farriers on over the division is made between the Upper Basin Waters and the Lower Basin Waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.898" offset="13322905">So it becomes very important to bind everyone in litigation.</text>
