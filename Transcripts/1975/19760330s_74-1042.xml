            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.320" offset="110876">Respondents in this case were customers of a small brokerage firm largely owned by its president Leston B. Nay. Respondents were induced by Nay to invest in a fraudulent security scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.225" offset="170540">The firm went bankrupt and Nay committed suicide.Petitioners in this case, Ernst &amp; Ernst, had audited firm’s books for many years and they did not discover the fraud because Nay was capable to maintain no records.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.900" offset="233234">His technique included a rule that he alone was authorized to open mail, addressed to the firm, to his attentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.658" offset="272209">After the bankruptcy, respondents sued the accounting firm alleging that it was negligent in failing to have discovered Nay’s rule with respect to opening mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.503" offset="315676">The theory was that, if discovered, that rule should have aroused the suspicion of the auditors and upon investigation the fraud would have been discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.767" offset="360711">This suit was brought under Section 10B and rule of 10B-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.276" offset="410762">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, reversing the District Court, held that respondents had stated a valid cause of action for damages, even though no negligence had been alleged -- I have that a bit wrong -- even though only negligence was alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.146" offset="490174">There was no allegation of fraud and no allegation of willful misconduct by Ernst &amp; Ernst.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.530" offset="519745">Section 10B speaks of manipulative and deceptive devices or contrivances.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.583" offset="551928">These word reflect a congressional intention to proscribe a type of conduct quite different from negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.591" offset="584006">Indeed the language Congress chose in other sections of the Securities Act that are directed to negligent conduct, stand in sharp contrast to the language of 10B-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.750" offset="636669">The legislative history of the 1934 Act, as well as the overall pattern that expressed civil liabilities created by the acts, also supports the view that Section 10B is not directed at merely negligent conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.650" offset="712215">For reasons more fully set forth in the opinion of the Court filed today with the clerk, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in reading a negligent standard into Section 10B and rule 10B-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.609" offset="776058">Accordingly, we reverse its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.566" offset="787866">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.125" offset="814093">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
