            <text syncTime="27.734" offset="214241">There is one issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.196" offset="224063">That issue arises from the fact that in 1926 Congress enacted a statute, the Northern Cheyenne Allotment Act, which made limited allotments of surface land on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, withheld minerals under those allotted surface lands from allotment and announced a plan to transfer those minerals 50 years in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.686" offset="310058">In 1968, Congress amended that statutory provision to withdraw the aspect of the statute which announced the plan to make a future transfer of minerals and instead left the minerals in the perpetual ownership of the Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.229" offset="376200">Precise issue before this Court is did the 1926 statutory plan for the future transfer of minerals, endow the allottees or their heirs or devisees with a vested right to the consummation of that future transfer.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.987" offset="855286">I think moreover that the facts and circumstances giving rise to the enactment namely the request by the Northern Cheyennes themselves that they receive in Allotment Act, clearly shows that the Northern Cheyennes themselves neither desired nor expected that they would be acquiring a property right to the minerals with the enactment of that act.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.455" offset="1009095">Subsequently Mr. Littlebird who was the client of Justice Department, based on his experience on the Reservation, concluded that it would be in the best interest of the Northern Cheyennes for tribal ownership of all the minerals and requested a discontinuance of their representation because of that.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="240.730" offset="1066250">But the Interior Department clearly agreed to your position.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_chestnut" startTime="242.814" stopTime="621.070">
            <label>Mr. Steven Chestnut</label>
            <text syncTime="242.814" offset="1074610">Interior Department supports us entirely and believes not only the Congress had the power to enact the 1968 amendment but moreover that its enactment is vital to the future survival of this Indian Tribe and this unique group of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.548" offset="1133542">Our position of course is that the 1926 statute created no vested rights in that future distribution and that Congress retained inherent continuing power to amend that aspect of the Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.738" offset="1194250">Looking particularly to the four constituent elements of the legislative and administrative process giving rise and surrounding this enactment, one finds, I think complete support for our position that no property right was presently transferred at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.823" offset="1254646">Firstly, the circumstances giving rise to the enactment shows that the Federal Allotment Policy itself commenced more or less in the end of the 1870s was formalized in 1887 with the enactment of the General Allotment Act and the basic theory was that the solution to the Indian problem would be to divide up tribal ownership into individual ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.047" offset="1335521">And pursuant to that policy individualized allotment acts were enacted for a host of reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.143" offset="1355896">The brother reservations of the Northern Cheyenne reservation, the State of Montana received Allotment Act very early under that policy, the Fort Belknap Reservation in 1888, the Flathead Reservation in 1904, The Crow Reservation in 1904, the Blackfeet Reservation in 1907 and the Fort Peck Reservation in 1908.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.230" offset="1432278">Yet by 1926 the Northern Cheyenne Reservation was not yet allotted in any sense and had received no allotment statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.088" offset="1463625">The reasons for this arose from two factors, one, the view of the administrator charged with the responsibility for administering Indian affairs, the Secretary of the Interior, that the Northern Cheyenne people themselves and the Northern Cheyenne Reservation physically was not be suitable for allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.011" offset="1531335">The other factor was that by the early 1920s, a severe reassessment of the allotment policy was underway and in fact there was substantial public and official skepticism about the utility of the allotment policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.033" offset="1587446">In particular, the Department of Interior felt that the Northern Cheyenne people were backward or have a long history of resistance to the white civilization and were not suitable for the “Civilizing Benefits” of allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.932" offset="1643034">Moreover the Department felt that the Reservation itself was not physically suitable for allotment because it was a grazing reservation and the allotment theory was really a farming theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.300" offset="1684517">So there was substantial official resistance to allotting the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.481" offset="1705206">This coupled with the emergence in the 1920s of the critical reassessment of the Allotment Policy made for offer great resistance within the government to allotting the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.187" offset="1744076">In fact, the 1926 Allotment Act that was enacted for the Northern Cheyennes was the last original allotment act ever enacted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.851" offset="1782737">Moreover, these circumstances gave rise to unique allotment act, an act far more limited than any other allotment act which Congress had ever enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.318" offset="1820562">The typical pattern for an allotment act in all of these other Montana reservations and the Osage Reservations and throughout the country was basically a substantial distribution of the entire corpus of tribal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.451" offset="1865179">Provisions were made for ailing ability of distributive property and as a result I might add -- and this is one of the reasons for the official reassessment of the allotment policy, 90 million acres of Indian lands were lost from Indian ownership and in fact today in the State of Montana if one looks around one will find that these allotted reservations are substantially either in white ownership on in white use.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.692" offset="1942084">However, the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, because of the unique allotment act, is in 98% Indian ownership, is in 99% Indian use, 85% of the population of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation is Northern Cheyenne and this is directly traceable to the unique and limited nature of that allotment act.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.057" offset="2011570">In any event, the Northern Cheyennes wanted, they were concerned that their reservation rested only on an executive order and that they therefore, the tribe as a whole therefore, did not have a vested confirmed property interest in that reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.644" offset="2065904">So they wanted a congressional enactment which would confirm tribal ownership of that executive order reservation. Secondly, they wanted limited allotments, so that they have a plot of land on which they could build homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.645" offset="2109895">Those were the two central functions of the Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.051" offset="2123478">The third function was to make sure that the natural resources of that reservation remained in tribal ownership, to be developed for the benefit of all the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.397" offset="2156915">The allotment plan itself, the allotment statute announced what I maintain as a plan, a statutory plan to transfer the mineral interest under allotted lands at the end of 50 years on the theory that the 50 year period would be adequate for development of that mineral resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.624" offset="2221803">It turned out because of external facts that the mineral wealth of the Reservation was not developable within that 50 year period and in 1968 Congress amended the act to implement the central intent of the 1926 Congress that the mineral wealth of the reservation inure to the benefit of all the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.442" offset="2293065">In any event, in February of 1925, the people themselves submitted a petition to Congress requesting the enactment of the Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.671" offset="2325979">The petition was submitted to their senator, Senator Thomas Walsh and the petition was very short, it is at Page 56 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.841" offset="2358685">It was signed by 490 members of the Tribe which according to my conservative calculation was 58% of the adult membership of the Tribe at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.832" offset="2398704">The cover letter that submitted this petition indicated that absolutely no opposition had been received, had been indicated on the Reservation to the concept of this petition and the petition is very short, in three paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.071" offset="2451576">The first paragraph says that the people want an allotment of tillable farm land.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.776" offset="2470384">The second paragraph which is crucial to the resolution of this case says that these people want the following “To reserve all mineral, timber and coal lands for the benefit of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Tribe said tribe to have absolute control of same.”</text>
            <text syncTime="608.889" offset="2538930">That event and that petition is what kicked off the legislative process for the formulation of an act which I submit, petitioners submit, conforms to this expressed desires and expectations of the people on the reservations.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven Chestnut</label>
            <text syncTime="636.751" offset="2650316">Well, I think that what Congress did in the statute was in two places in unprecedented fashion, make very broad reservations of power over the entire allotment plan and the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.826" offset="2710606">Other allotment acts like the Crow Allotment Act and these other Montana Allotment Act and the Osage Allotment Act which basically were massive assault on the tribal system, had very specific reservations of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.260" offset="2756373">And I think the question maybe directed to an argument advanced by respondents that the Northern Cheyenne did not have a specific reservation of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.956" offset="2787197">The Northern Cheyenne had an overall or encompassing reservation of power which I submit was in complete conformity with the central intent of Congress which was that we are relinquishing trust responsibility, we are not taking part of this reservation apart, we are maintaining the Federal control and we are doing a very little limited thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.658" offset="2865983">Now with high insight, it might have been good to enumerate every aspect, the federal control that was being retained but on the other hand, I think those things are hard to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.685" offset="2910077">So I guess --</text>

            <text syncTime="709.851" offset="2942678">I think it is a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.350" offset="2952709">The Congress of the United States did not have to reserve any particular power to alter executory unconsummated aspects of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.639" offset="2989908">It is a matter of law and I think Congress was operating in 1926 on the basis of a body of decisions of this Court interpreting allotment for legislation, which established that Congress has inherent authority to alter allotment distributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.922" offset="3042988">In fact, in the legislative history of the Crow Allotment Act, in a supplement to the Crow Allotment Act, the 1920 provision, there was a debate on the floor of Congress about whether or not it was necessary for Congress to specifically reserve a power to extend a period of the minerals reservation, and the statement on the floor of Congress in connection with that precise question was it is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.296" offset="3132536">We have inherent authority to do that and I think that is completely supported by the cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven Chestnut</label>
            <text syncTime="767.474" offset="3173183">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.086" offset="3175690">I will do that right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.575" offset="3181646">The respondents argue that by extending or perpetuating the tribal ownership of minerals, the mineral state in the tribe is thereby subjected to state taxation under a separate federal statute and that that constitutes a divestment of tribal property in favor of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.468" offset="3265238">There are number of answers to that which I have set forth in the reply brief, but I will try to recall the basic ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.637" offset="3297839">Number one, that is really not the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.200" offset="3308079">The issue in this case is, did respondents have a vested property right which Congress could not take away?</text>
            <text syncTime="808.807" offset="3338590">Respondents by this argument tried to bootstrap themselves basically into this standing of the Tribe and say that the Tribe is losing some kind of vested property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.519" offset="3373385">Really it is outside the issues in this case, it is inappropriate argument, the basic question here is did the 1968 amendment take away some vested property right of respondents?</text>
            <text syncTime="827.363" offset="3412778">Secondly, the tax statute, which is 25 U.S.C. Section 398c, which, respondents argue, would subject this tribal state to state taxation, is in fact not applicable to this Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.937" offset="3483099">That Statute is applicable purely to executive order reservations and under a decision of this Court, British-American case, which I believe was decided in 1939, it was held that an Indian Reservation which would base initially an executive order and subsequently receive congressional -- congressionally conformed by statute is not an executive order reservation within the meaning of that tax statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.264" offset="3580379">Thirdly, I think the argument of respondents is really inherently circular.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.841" offset="3606711">If they are contending that the tax statute 398c subjects the tribal mineral state to taxation during this perpetuated ownership period, and that that was a taking, then certainly that statue was a taking when it was enacted in 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.202" offset="3684138">That tax statute was enacted in 1927 after tribal title in the entire reservation was confirmed by Congress; the tribe had a whole lot of vested property right at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.061" offset="3727606">Therefore, if the statute by taxing tribal lands as a taking, it was a taking at that point and that theory is not applicable either.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.164" offset="3763968">Moreover, the Northern Cheyenne Act itself, the Allotment Act specifically provides that leasing of tribal minerals would be conducted under 1938 statute, this was incorporated in a subsequent amendment, and that, we submit, makes this 1927 statute inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.399" offset="3832931">There are other arguments which I will not go through but we have made them all in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.070" offset="3867622">The petition of the Northern Cheyenne people was submitted in 1924 and the legislative process, we submit, conformed completely to the expressed desires and hopes of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.353" offset="3912761">The Department of Interior grudgingly responded with an allotment bill which was very limited as I have indicated uniquely limited, specifically reserved minerals from allotment and specifically allotted only surface lands for agricultural and farming purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.463" offset="3969186">And finally, upon enactment in the House of Representatives of the final form of the Act, the House’s response over the bill, Representative Levitt indicated that the Act -- the purpose of the Act was to make allotments so that the individual Northern Cheyennes could “have permanent homes and develop their own farms.”</text>
            <text syncTime="985.789" offset="4046508">Moreover he indicated that the Act “offers a means for the development of any mineral resources such as oil which is maybe discovered on the Reservation for the benefit of the tribe.”</text>
            <text syncTime="996.853" offset="4090708">Lastly, he indicated that the Act “gives the Indians the fullest possible benefit of their natural resources.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.343" offset="4116726">The 50 year provision was a provision, there is no explicit mention of the genesis of that 50 year provision in the legislative record, but I think the fair reading of the entire legislative history is that the purpose of that provision was to ultimately unify title after the mineral reserve was developed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1070.775" offset="4386414">Now, the reason that it was made a perpetual extension was because the Department of Interior pointed out to Congress that the essential purpose of this amendment was to fulfill the 1926 intent and to provide for full development of the mineral wealth for the benefit of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.945" offset="4459139">As a result, they indicated that there was -- the intent of Congress was not to transfer anything of substantial value to the allottees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.595" offset="4489754">It pointed out moreover that after a full development -- if a full development period were allowed by that point in time the airship situation on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, which is already somewhat complicated, 17% of the respondent class is neither Northern Cheyenne and in some cases not Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.961" offset="4563210">That if the Reservation were extended for an additional finite period of time, 50 years or 100 years, the airship situation would be impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.111" offset="4591736">In view of the fact that nothing of value was intended to be transferred at that point, there was really no utility in imposing upon the Department of Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the tremendous problem of sorting out the airship difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.594" offset="4641682">So that was the genesis of the perpetual extension.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.196" offset="4692151">It would be tribal property and the Congress has complete authority to provide for distribution of tribal property to tribal members under its plenary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.236" offset="4732275">Finally, I would like to point to the administrative interpretation of the meaning of this Act immediately after its enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.342" offset="4756726">The allotments will consummated after 1926, between 1926 and 1934 by the issuance of allotment patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.014" offset="4791416">These patents made a blanket reservation of all minerals and natural resources for the benefit of the Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.851" offset="4818688">It contained no mention of the 50 year transfer, no covenant to make a 50 year transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.411" offset="4836974">In short, there was no basis from the document itself for the Northern Cheyennes, to believe and in fact they did not believe or expect or hope for that they would be acquiring a property interest in these minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.522" offset="4881382">Thus, as a result of the enactment of the 1926 Act and the issuance of the patents, what did the allottees have in the way of indicia of property in this mineral resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.938" offset="4935090">Plainly and simply, all they had was a statute which announced the plan to, in the future, create a property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.256" offset="4964347">They had no power to transfer that future property, that future interest, whatever it may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.119" offset="4987753">They had no power to profit from it directly by their own transactions.No power to do anything with respect to that future provision in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.813" offset="5022548">Moreover, they had no physical control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.945" offset="5031116">They had no power of enjoyment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.002" offset="5043341">The 1926 Act lodged leasing authority over the entire mineral resource in the Tribal Council and provided that all proceeds of mineral development on the Reservation would inure to the benefit of the Northern Cheyenne people as a whole, would be deposited in the United States Treasury, and would be expended for the benefit of the Northern Cheyennes as Congress might deem expedient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.436" offset="5133098">Lastly, this future interest that these allottees, this expectancy that these allottees had after 1926 was subject to the tribe’s complete power to exhaust that reserve and moreover, to the statutory provision which said that the proceeds of such development of that reserve would inure to the benefit of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.105" offset="5227766">So, it is not possible to identify any conventional index of property arising from either the 1926 Act or the allotment patents issued subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.347" offset="5292758">Moving now to the strict legal question of what the state of the law with regard to the power of Congress to alter executory unconsummated portions, of statutory plans for the distribution of tribal property to tribal members, the decisions of this Court starting most prominently in 1912 with the decision Gritts versus Fisher and then a whole string of decisions up to the recent decision of United States versus Jim in 1972 consistently and uniformly reaffirm that the statutory plan which contemplates a future distribution is amendable, alterable, repealable by Congress in light of changing conditions and the best interest of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.901" offset="5462972">That power, in those cases, is founded on this Court’s perception that it is crucial to Congress’s historic and constitutional function to serve Indians and Indian property, that Congress maintain authority over the tribal property of tribal Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.030" offset="5547400">And furthermore that that authority is essential for the implementation of federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.658" offset="5565999">It is found that on the notion, a legal notion that no right, no individual right in tribal property arises until the tribal property is actually distributed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1376.705" offset="5610094">Of course Congress could, in the 68 Act it simply it said that we are giving the reserve mineral rights to the Tribe and if that is a taking the allottees can sue in the Court of Claims or sue in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.363" offset="5676758">I take it Congress would have had that part of the fact that they provided that the 68 Act would be void if interest had actually vested, suggest that Congress is perhaps more concerned in that case than it might have been in others as to whether there had are been a vesting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.457" offset="5785114">I think that first of all, that particular uncertainty at that point does not completely mesh with Congress’s prior view of the statute and this legislative statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.517" offset="5841434">In 1961, Congress amended this Allotment Act to make very substantial encumbrances upon this expectancy of the allottees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.889" offset="5878841">First of all, it provided that the Tribe could enter into minerals leases which would extend indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.720" offset="5906218">In effect it took away the right, assuming there was a right, in these allottees to themselves transact independently of the Tribe with respect to this future interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.273" offset="5940386">Secondly, the statute added the term ‘devisees’ to the class of future beneficiaries of this mineral right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.694" offset="5970061">It provided -- the original Act provided that the future interest will be transferred to the allottees or their heirs, in 1961 Congress said the allottees, their heirs or devisees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.326" offset="6012588">In 1961, therefore, in the case of an original allottee who had died prior to 1961 and asked to whom they had been ascertained an existing heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.122" offset="6051772">Those heirs by that 1961 amendment were supplanted by devisees, my point being that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1498.487" offset="6097225">Moreover the 1961 statute specifically said that any prior transfers of that future interest by the allottees or their heirs was null and void, and that any future transfers within the remainder in 50 year period would be null and void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.510" offset="6145395">My point is that the conservatism in 1968 was not evident in 1961 and I think the basic reason for the conservatism was a concern that an awareness that this mineral reserve was quite valuable and a concern that United States not in fact be subjected to this kinds of claims of damages which you refered to Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.638" offset="6225852">I think it was a concern to absolutely eliminate any possibility that the United States would be liable in damages and I think that the legislative history indicates that Congress felt it had the power to do it but out of, what I would consider excessive and inconsistent concern, it incorporated this very unusual provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.988" offset="6311325">Finally, I would like to make the point that this exercise in 1968 of Congress’s inherent power to amend this statutory provision was -- in the facts involved here was entirely -- and proves the premise on which it is based, which is that Congress needs that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.329" offset="6412680">By 1968, the coal reserve on this reservation had been undeveloped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.245" offset="6432324">The reservation was in the poverty stricken state, the Northern Cheyenne culture was intact, the people were still speaking Northern Cheyenne, they still do as a matter of fact and the reservation was still a home land for a unique fragile culture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.264" offset="6488330">Suddenly the coal became commercially desirable, the entire reservation is underlaying with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.189" offset="6516125">But shortly 53% of that reserve would be lost through this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.161" offset="6543919">In that instance, individual allottees who were lucky enough to rest atop valuable coal would become rich and other allottees, members of the Tribe who were not that lucky would stay poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.461" offset="6589163">There would be haves and have not on reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.610" offset="6601806">Moreover, the ownership situation would have been fractionated into an impossible situation with this complicated airship problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.285" offset="6632422">There would be impossible marketing conditions, there would be absentee ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.072" offset="6651648">You would have in -- 37% of this class consist of people who do not live on the Northern Cheyenne reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.076" offset="6679651">The respondents include people in Honolulu, in San Francisco, in Seattle, in Florida, in Bayonne, New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.465" offset="6709222">These people, under this statutory plan, would be making decisions regarding strip mining of a substantial portion of this reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.704" offset="7914094">One will find and this is detailed in the reply brief, one will find that that proviso was ultimately included and left out of the Osage Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.481" offset="7953277">The Osage Act was enacted in 1906, it has a proviso of the sort you are thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.111" offset="7971772">I think a fair reading of the statute shows that the proviso only applied to a portion in fact, to the coal reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.137" offset="7995909">In any event, Congress subsequently extended that coal ownership in 1921 to a date certain without reserving any further power to extend it further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.454" offset="8041153">Nevertheless, in 1929, Congress came along and extended it to yet another date certain and this time re-introduced a proviso that it was incorporating reserve power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.582" offset="8077620">In the Crow Act, there was specific statement on the floor of the House in reference to this proviso that it was not necessary to preserve what was really Congress’s inherent power, and I think the history of the formulation of the Crow Act shows that the proviso was not for the purpose of preserving an inherent power but arose from a disagreement between the house and the senate of whether the 25 years or 50 years was the right initial period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.587" offset="8189633">It arose from a compromise not over a generic inherent power of Congress but over whether or not the initial period should be 25 years or 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.183" offset="8220040">I think that those provisions on their face maybe impressive but when you go behind them, when you take a look at the actual legislative history which gave rise to their creation and when you take a look at the basic act that they arise and then compared to the basic Act of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, you can give no real credence to that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.960" offset="8299139">It is ludicrous frankly to think that Congress intended to relinquish thrust the responsibility in its enactment of the Northern Cheyenne Allotment Act which it did not relinquish in taking apart these other reservations clearly.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven L. Bunch</label>
            <text syncTime="2337.637" offset="9453855">Right, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.597" offset="9457721">That was they intended in that shall become property of language in Section 3 of the Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.088" offset="9479664">We feel that this did not create a vested remainder type interest for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.512" offset="9501398">First of all it is the legislative history of the 26 Act which I have outlined in pages 33 through 35 of my brief, and if this legislative history indicates the Congress knowingly intended to currently vest the remainder interest in the allottees and their heirs, our construction of this language is that it permitted a currently vesting but delayed possession of the mineral state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.228" offset="9612262">We feel this is soul because most of the congressional considerations of this bill took place in the Senate Committee on Indian affairs and they substantially re-wrote the bill and we feel that if you look at the language of the bill as it went into this committee and as it emerged from the committee you can get an idea of what Congress was trying to do with this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.753" offset="9690316">As the allotment of the minerals went into this committee it provided that they will not quote only the surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.109" offset="9723753">Now this only the surface language could be intended to as the congressional intent that they intended to allot only the surface presently and that they intended to delay allotting the minerals that led -- they intended to delay any vesting of the minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.257" offset="9776311">However, the committee specifically rejected that language and they gave this remainder type interest to the allottees in equivocal terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.058" offset="9815599">There were no contingencies apart from the passage of the 50 year term and that -- it is not really the contingency as such as I understand and anyway they rejected the language which would be fairly strong in favor of the petitioners position and rejected that and gave the allottees their interest in unequivocal terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.636" offset="9909849">Also I will point out that the grant to the allottees heir is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.391" offset="9924895">As was mentioned earlier the language says “shall become” and this has been interpreted to be mandatory language and was not leaving the grant to the discretion of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.397" offset="9968886">I submit that the term shall being a future tense term refers to the shall -- the possession being future tense not the vesting being future tense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.326" offset="10028654">Also, it is interesting to compare the Northern Cheyenne Allotment Act with other Allotment Acts as was mentioned earlier, when Congress choose to extend -- to reserve the power to extend tribal ownership, they specifically did so, they expressly included provisions in the grant of the minerals and said, the minerals will be held by the Tribe for X number of the years then passed to the allottees but they always include the all important proviso unless otherwise provided by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.302" offset="10148504">It is for the Crow Reservation, the Fort Belknap Reservation, Blackfeet Reservation, the Osage Reservation, the Standing Rock Reservation and Cheyenne River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.989" offset="10195315">Standing Rock and Cheyenne River are one reservation; the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Reservation, and all these allotment acts were passed prior to the 26 Allotment Act period issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.488" offset="10229274">Thus this unless provided otherwise that Congress had become a standard form proviso, whenever Interior or whoever is drafting these bills, wanted to reserve this power, they just included this clause in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.584" offset="10273682">However, they did not do it in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.374" offset="10280788">And we submit that this indicates a congressional wish not to reserve this power and not to delay the ordinary vesting process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.131" offset="10319867">And according to the ordinary vesting process in Allotment Acts, the allottees’ rights and interest in that allotment vest when he files his allotment application in the Bureaus of Indian Affairs Office, and since the remainder interest in the mineral state was allotted as of that time, the rights of the allottee to his remainder interest in the mineral state vested when he filed his application in the local BIA office in Lame Deer or pro-agency or wherever he filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.332" offset="10456644">The timing of the vesting is according to this Court’s decisions in Arenas versus US, Raymond Bear Hill and allotment rights in Fort Belknap, San Juan County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.506" offset="10493320">Also, in the petitioners’ reply brief, they bring up the point that many of our authorities regarding the allottees vesting of the rights have to do with overriding executive discretion and not congressional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.765" offset="10550371">However, there are several of these decisions which do override their Congressional statute which intent to abrogate the allotment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.697" offset="10602094">For instance, the allotment rights in the Fort Belknap decision was the Department of the Interior decision in which the Indian allottee had filed application for allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.108" offset="10647756">The trust allotment had not been issued and the Wheeler-Howard Act took effect, the Wheeler-Howard Act said no more allotment -- we will have no more allotment of tribal land therefore this was congressional statute which said there would be no more allotments issued..</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.166" offset="10696030">However, Department of Interior said he had filed his application prior to that time, so despite this provision, the Wheeler-Howard Act, we are going to issue the trust patent in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.311" offset="10736572">Also, Raymond Bear Hill was factually similar situation in which he had filed his allotment application, there was a -- and within the pathway Identical, the one here at issues was said that Tribe get the minerals, and the Department of Interior said, well he filed his application before, this act of the fed reserve (ph) in the Minerals of the Tribe, therefore, they would issues the trust patent, giving the Minerals to Raymond Bear Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.327" offset="10828628">Also, the allotment rights in the San Juan County is very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.771" offset="10858407">Also the petitioner claims that there are broad reservations of power in the 1926 Allotment Act it maybe helpful given in these context they actually set out in its entirety at the beginning of the Appendix to examine the sections, as I mentioned each section and discuss each section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.636" offset="10949836">The first reservation of power is a very broad reservation of power, well, we would also like to mention that on the normal period of vesting that the vesting on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation would have had taken place by 1934 between 1926 and 34 because of Wheeler-Howard Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.625" offset="11021829">In June of 34 did terminate the allotment rights where we have no exact dates on when these rights vested, it would have had been in that period.</text>

            <text syncTime="2962.111" offset="11951788">Well, I go to part of the section which courts and member of authorities would disagree with that including, Felix Cohen and this Court in a number of its decisions, and matter of a fact, there was a statement in Choate which specifically disagrees with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.006" offset="12067354">Alright! On top of Page 23, the Atoka Agreement was a contract and the Court specifically says the question here is whether the parties of the contract whether they have right under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.733" offset="12110299">There has been numerous cases of this Court that have also held that it was statutory rights and property rights, it is not the contract like case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.293" offset="12148543">But anyway, the Section 1 language, it says that subject to the management control of Congress, we submit a simply statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.577" offset="12189607">This was the initial recognition by Congress of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.986" offset="12207266">Thus we submit that they should be interpreted that Congress is saying, we recognize the Northern Cheyenne Reservation as a legitimate Reservation and we are going to assume our normal guardianship duties on this Reservation?.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.848" offset="12246763">And the statement of normal guardianship duties is what this management and control language mean on the Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.152" offset="12267975">Also I would remind you that this is an Allotment Act and the very purpose of an Allotment Act is to vest individual rights and real property in individual Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.125" offset="12303815">And if you take the opening proviso this management and control language is opening proviso of in Allotment Act which does not specific to minerals, it could be it is a power to aggregate otherwise vested rights could be use to divest any right on that reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.051" offset="12359508">So you would have Congress in a curious position of beginning in Allotment Act with proviso which could destroy the very purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.820" offset="12386570">And I submit that you should not impute such a skids away legislative design on Congress without more convincing evidence which is the statute does not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.198" offset="12432128">There is also a management in control language listed in Section 3 which is right at the very end of Section 3, and, however I would, report, submit to the Court and this does not reach the Allotment Minerals insured issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.756" offset="12502345">The only Minerals insured issues are the minerals underlying the Allotment land, not underlying the Tribal land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.202" offset="12528154">The Court in Section 3 says that the management and the control is limited to allotted lands or tribal land and since to remained your interest in the Tribal State was allotted, it is not subject to that Section 3 management control language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.707" offset="12586146">This was the Ninth Circuit’s opinions and conclusion on this matter and I submit it should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.590" offset="12713728">I thought the issue was settled by this high Court way back in 1912, in Choate versus Trapp and there has been at least eight more decisions from that time confirming that same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.556" offset="12781542">It is the respondent’s position and they, I might draw the Court’s attention to the fact, owned only 38% of the surface of the entire reservation, the Tribal Corporation already owned 68% of the minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.993" offset="12863253">The Allottees have a mere 38% left, but I am going to direct the Courts attention to the treaty of 1868, which I think is the first indicia of governmental intent as to what the Allottees would seek to take in the treaty which was entered into under threat of force of arms, because Martial Law had been declared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.144" offset="12995850">Colonel Chivington slaughtered the Northern Cheyenne men, women and children at Sand Creek, as a result of that, the Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho retaliated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.341" offset="13048722">In 1865, Martial Law was declared and under threat of force of arms the treaty of 1868 was entered into by the Tribe with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.929" offset="13099086">Under that original treaty, the Cheyenne, to induce them to lay down their arms, were promised a permanent reservation and the Allottees were promise threats of land in the amount of 320 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.319" offset="13196575">After that another slaughter took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.139" offset="13227922">A bare three months after that treaty was proclaimed to be the law of the land, the Cheyenne and the Sioux were again slaughtered men, women and children.</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.472" offset="14057258">So the United States of America and Acts the 1968 amendment to the 1926 Act and says now, we gave you the minerals not for 50 years but in perpetually, that should certainly give you enough time to remove all the minerals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3678.573" offset="14817630">Well the Tribe sat on their rights for 50 years and did nothing and did not dig out these minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.630" offset="14845842">And it says, at the end of 50 years that the minerals shall become the property of the allottees, heir and devisees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.963" offset="14879175">Well, he wants it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.898" offset="14886907">It is this year, he is been waiting for, he wants it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.701" offset="14902162">There was no qualifying phrase as there were in five other allotment acts that all preceded the Northern Cheyenne Allotment Act..</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.618" offset="14945839">Starting in 1902 or 06, all the way up until the 1926 Act, five prior acts and petitioner would have this Court believe that the Congress just dropped the phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.335" offset="15008637">He just forgot or he added at some play else when he makes reference to not allotted lands but un-allotted lands, tribal lands, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.561" offset="15053568">United States retains plenary power over tribal lands, but he did not say that about allotted lands, and here I think is the crucial salian point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.368" offset="15108843">This is where the Congress can be said to have intended just as the Government intended in the original 1868 treaty to convey to the Indian, his minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.257" offset="15172373">The Indian has been kept gentlemen, a psychological cripple for many-many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.324" offset="15200585">He now wants to determine where he is going and when, and if you reverse the decisions of this Court which is clearly indicate that Choate versus Trapp is controlling, you will set the Indian back 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.725" offset="15294208">Thank you.</text>
