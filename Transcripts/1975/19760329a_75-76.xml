            <text syncTime="36.194" offset="248075">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.288" offset="260405">This case of the State of South Dakota versus Opperman comes here on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of South Dakota, and basically what we have in this case is a question of an inventory procedure of an automobile that was taken pursuant to lawful ordinance of the City of Vermillion, South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.646" offset="345878">I think the facts are particularly important with respect to this particular case, they are very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.507" offset="373359">In the early morning hours of December 12, I should say December 10, 1973, there was a car parked on the street in Vermillion, South Dakota which is a small college town, the seat of the University of South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.588" offset="429679">The ordinances in the City of Vermillion prohibit parking there from 2 AM to 6 AM in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.729" offset="454234">This vehicle was parked there during that period of time received the ticket from the Police Officer the next morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.784" offset="474400">It was still there at approximately 10 a.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.683" offset="482028">The meter maid in making her rounds, put a ticket on the car, shortly there after when she completed the rounds, she reported it to the Police Department at which time the one of the Police Officers, Officer Frank, went over looked at the car, and examined the two tickets, and had the car towed away to the impoundment lot in Vermillion.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.404" offset="560918">The impoundment lot in Vermillion is an unguarded lot and as the record clearly establishes, they have had trouble there previously with respect to having cars broken into and vandalized when they have been put in the impound lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.204" offset="608147">As you look through the window of the automobile, the windows were locked, I should say rolled up, and the doors were locked.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.762" offset="630404">As he proceeded in to look into automobile, he could see a wrist watch and other items on the back seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.025" offset="659452">He had the tow truck operator to open the truck, open the door latch I should say, and he proceeded pursuant to the standard procedure of the Vermillion Police Department with a standard procedural form to go through and inventory the contents of the automobile for valuables.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.832" offset="722668">The standard inventory consisted of things such as the outside, the exterior condition of the car, the dashboard, the seats, the floors, and things to that nature.</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="164.404" offset="760911">Mr. Janklow you drawn the distinction, what is the difference between the inventory and the search?</text>

            <label>Mr. William J. Janklow</label>
            <text syncTime="170.021" offset="783377">I think in our brief, we attempted to draw the distinction between an inventory and search, and frankly we no longer do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.487" offset="809290">I do not draw a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.341" offset="816709">I do draw as distinction in the word search between criminal searching type conduct and normal inventorying type thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.949" offset="847115">But I will get in to that Mr. Justice Marshall, but, we do not attempt at this point before the Court to say that an inventory is an intrusion which is the Fourth Amendment type of search situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.954" offset="1011164">It does not, Your Honor, because of the fact that after this -- they have had several instances where cars had been vandalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.102" offset="1039690">The Vermillion Police Department is a small Police Department in a college town, the impoundment lot is not secure or guarded at anytime and they have had past instances of people breaking in the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.121" offset="1083785">So, as a result of that particular procedure, they have started inventorying cars for the valuable contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.640" offset="1105832">As a matter of fact, in our particular case, the respondent Opperman has never contested at any point in this proceedings including in the briefing stages before the Supreme Court that the Police Officer did not have followed a proper procedure and was doing nothing wrong in violation of any Amendment including the Fourth Amendment when he entered the car, the locked car to search for the, I should not say the search, to secure, retrieve and put into safety the contents, the watch and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.298" offset="1228503">There is never been any argument that the Police Officer have done anything that was not in fact correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.644" offset="1245848">So, basically, what we come down to is during the point of the time that the Officer was retrieving the items from inside the body of the car, he checked the glove compartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.992" offset="1283256">He opened the glove box, it was close but it was not locked and open it up in it he found a checkbook and installment loan contract or installment loan papers, blank checks, some keys and for the purposes of this case, less than an ounce of Marijuana.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.446" offset="1357130">What is the practice, Mr. Janklow, do they take it out of the car then, these items or do they leave them in?</text>

            <text syncTime="321.025" offset="1387432">No Sir, they were taken out of the car and they were in this case, all of these items to the Vermillion Police Department pursuant -- after they filled out an inventory sheet and approximately 5 a.m., or I should say 5 p.m. of the same afternoon, Mr. Opperman, respondent Opperman came to the Vermillion Police Department, picked up his belongings and his valuables, received them back with the exception of the Marijuana where warrant was served at him.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.166" offset="1487951">Citation was issued, and that brought about the reason for this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="374.653" offset="1601950">The reason for that again is -- I think we are involved basically with three particular issues when we are talking about safety of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.879" offset="1642805">The first issue is the safety of the individual who owns the car’s property.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.443" offset="1661091">Opperman obviously left his watch on the dash and argument then I think could be made that by leaving his wrist watch on the dash, he could careless whether or not somebody took his watch.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.729" offset="1698185">But, he left it out on the main street of Vermillion, South Dakota where it is well left and it was moved to a different place pursuant to legitimate or lawful Police activity under the ordinance of the City of Vermillion Police Department.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.746" offset="2186257">The State of South Dakota is not contending that everything that is there has the right to be going through.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.879" offset="2206841">For example, we are not arguing for a moment that we could go inside the wrist watch to look for things.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.586" offset="2281656">We did not have any trunk that was entered, we feel that the scope of the search or the scope of the intrusion or whatever characterization the activity should be given, whatever terminology it should be given, is one enough activity to one, secure the item and two, to be able to reasonably identify it for the purposes of safe keeping and inventory.</text>

            <text syncTime="586.541" offset="2449466">I am not aware of any other case in Vermillion that is arisen with respect to the discovery of anything for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.635" offset="2477888">We have got -- I am familiar with the amicus briefs that was file from Americans Reflective Law Enforcement, I believe it is the name of the organization and they cite statistics dealing with other areas of the country which show that in fact, a very small portion of the automobiles in those sample areas that are inventory involve the recovery of any properties that deals with criminal activity, and frankly, it would be the most unproductive, assuming that the statistics that had been submitted are true, it would be the most unprotected fight for Police activity that you can imagine and it would certainly be wasteful, and that there are better things that Police could do with respect to protection of the people and the property and the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.215" offset="2648206">And, so for those reasons, we do not feel that that is the secondary motive at all Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.542" offset="2681434">We think that one of the key things that we have here is that we certainly are not in the particular situations like some of the more large states are or the more popular states are.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.148" offset="2723857">You take States such as New York, Illinois, Michigan and places like that that have the larger Police Departments, that have the facilities, impoundment lots with high wire fences around them, guards around them and things to that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.050" offset="2775475">And, you know, I do not know that we would be here if were representing one of those states and face with that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.537" offset="2797417">But we are dealing with Vermillion, South Dakota where frankly we just do not have the resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.923" offset="2814972">I think it is more than just the protection of the individual’s property that we are talking about when we talked about this inventorying procedure, because we have also got the protection of the law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.755" offset="2850289">Now our Supreme Court attempted to minimize that particular problem by stating that because the individual had left his car and had lawfully come in to the custody of the Law Enforcement Community by reason of the fact that the ordinance provided that it would be impounded, that it be taken away for the improper parking, that the Law Enforcement Community then at that point became a gratuitous bailee and as a result there liability, if any, was very slight.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.709" offset="2970139">But, I do not think frankly that Fourth Amendment is ever, an interpretation of the Fourth Amendment is ever turned on what the financial obligations are or responsibilities are of any of the particular varieties involved in the proceeding, and the one additional thing which was --</text>

            <text syncTime="729.328" offset="3020608">Mr. Janklow, I suppose regardless of the standard imposed by South Dakota as to what kind of bailee, you can still get into arguments about whether something was or was not, in fact, in the glove compartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.152" offset="3071912">If someone comes along later and says it was stolen.</text>

            <label>Mr. William J. Janklow</label>
            <text syncTime="745.030" offset="3083406">I think that is correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist except -- we work from the premise basically that all people are honest.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.529" offset="3109424">We pre suppose that they are going to honest, and that one, if the first individual that has the interior contact or the contact with the automobile inventory, it is a question of that one person’s word against anybody else’s one; and two, you have got the situation where once the community knows that impounded automobiles are inventoried, it is certainly going to not make a lot of sense once the words out for them to go vandalizing and breaking in the cars any longer that have no valuables, and then because they have been taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.820" offset="3230632">So, I think that there is a third category here, a protection and that is protection of people from not being encouraged, especially young people, juveniles, to go and burglarizing and vandalizing cars when they realize there will not be any fruits there.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.939" offset="3283086">And so, I think we are not only talking about protection of the Law Enforcement Community, we are also talking about protection of the individual who has got possession or originally had possessions of the vehicle or at least whose property is in the vehicle, as well as the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.778" offset="3334390">So, I think there are three areas of protection that we are dealing with, with respect to this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.164" offset="3419968">We feel that with respect to the Court’s decision, in Cady versus Dombrowski that basically although it did not come down on exactly the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.086" offset="3459674">It was awful close that the language of that is could be controlling or could be governing.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.419" offset="3480990">The parallels that could be drawn from a real community in Wisconsin with Vermillion, South Dakota are certainly there.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.112" offset="3503768">With respect to the activity of the Law Enforcement Officers, the parallel was there other than a fact that in Dombrowski, they were dealing with looking for a firearm for generally the protection of the general public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.086" offset="3555700">We are dealing with an automobile in both instances that lawfully came into the control of the Law Enforcement Community and I think one of the most important things is there has never been an allegation at any time in our case, as the same is true in Dombrowski that the Law Enforcement Officers were looking for one any criminal evidence that they were conducting any criminal investigation, that they were involved in anyway, in pursuing the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.628" offset="3645770">No allegations ever been made that there was any attempt to subterfuge, or I should say that there was a subterfuge being used in this inventory process to pursue the criminal law or any criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.664" offset="3689969">As a matte of fact, the records clear at least as far as the trial transcript is concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.206" offset="3708150">I believe the page number is 27, when a Law Enforcement Officer was asked, he said that until he was in 1the process of doing this inventory and came across the items in the glove compartment, he had no reason to suspect anything improper with respect to that particular motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.125" offset="3795817">I think the key or in a lot of cases in this area, especially in the Supreme Court level, the Supreme Court’s cases of Cooper, Harris and Dombrowski are basically the three key cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.137" offset="3851824">Dealing with the Cooper case, first I should say, then the Harris case and then of most recent nature, the case in Dombrowski in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.870" offset="3902815">Preston case was discussed a lot in all of these various cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.352" offset="3916712">But the Preston case, we submit, is not involved in our issue here, the 1964 Preston decision for the reason that Preston dealt with an attempt by the State to say that a car was taken pursuant to a valid arrest, even though -- or the search I should say was conducted pursuant to a valid arrest, when in fact that was no the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.927" offset="4006991">Individuals were arrested for vagrancy there and the issues, the holding in Preston has been, on many occasions, referred back to is the fact that it is confined specifically to the facts that you have in Preston and that we do not have here with this particular case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.737" offset="4070208">Law Enforcement Officers were not in any legal custody of the Preston vehicle and as a matter of fact, they attempted in subsequent argument or I should in further argument to say that, the car might had been stolen and that is the reason they were looking at it from that standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.335" offset="4128617">So, we feel that the Preston case is not controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.337" offset="4140634">There is an additional case other than those that have been cited in the briefs, the Fourth Circuit, I have been informed, has recently come down with a decision, dealing with this particular type of Fourth Amendment question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2739.674" offset="11062038">Cady was unconscious; here Opperman was even not around.</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.829" offset="11158586">Yet, an argument is not made that there was some expectation the police should go around and around looking for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.688" offset="11178021">When the obvious thing would have been, and had he cared, was to get a hold of the Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.390" offset="11192859">Second of all, Cady, there was a nuisance the car park; here there was a nuisance with car park.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.935" offset="11215011">There is a legitimate ordinance that there is no argument but there is a legitimate ordinance that provides that cars that break the law with respect to the parking have to be removed between 2 and 6 a.m. With respect to the impoundment in Cady the car was impounded and here the car was impounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.998" offset="11271331">In Cady it happened to be seven miles from the Police Station, on the rural country of Wisconsin, here we happened of had it taken inside the community of Vermillion, but also not at the Police Station, and also on a public place where it was unprotected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.204" offset="11324098">In Cady, they talked about motive and here we talked about motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.366" offset="11336741">In Cady, the motive was to search for the weapon to protect the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.218" offset="11352206">There was no argument but what the police and Cady where doing was to look for the weapon one, and two their contact with the car was a non-criminal contact because the car was a nuisance and they legitimately had it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2874.190" offset="11600056">We think that that would be proper just because trunks are broken into just like glove boxes are broken into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.549" offset="11621476">This particular case we have here Mr. Justice White, respondent concedes where in the car and he would have us just stop and look at the glove box and not even check to see what is open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.993" offset="11659301">But, we would submit that the legitimate areas of concern for the protection, on the balancing test under what is reasonable, and we would submit that the reasonable substandard, the objective standard of Terry versus Ohio, that was set forth by the Court in Terry versus Ohio would certainly be the one that will be applicable in could be applicable with respect to these inventory procedures are that the interior of the car, the body of the car I should say, under the hood and the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.384" offset="11760866">That does not mean you tare off the door panels, it does not mean you tare the seats apart, does not mean you go up under the behind the dash, and those kind of things.</text>

            <label>Mr. William J. Janklow</label>
            <text syncTime="2931.598" offset="11829724">I would say the answer to that would be yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.961" offset="11839128">Just because of thief that would go in there would break up that glove box, but I would also submit that if that was our fax, I would be in a completely different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.261" offset="11872356">I think would be less tenuous, or I should say more tenuous than it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.743" offset="11890328">Now, but we submit that reasonableness is in fact the standard under the Fourth Amendment, clearly the Fourth Amendment demands reasonableness and the standard of Terry versus Ohio on the objective test, that is the one that would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.563" offset="11937558">The last point that the State would suggest is what had when he found the wrist watch on the dash, had he opened the glove box to put it in there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.731" offset="11970263">To get it out on plane view and seeing the marijuana with the respondent present then arguing that for some reason, the Law Enforcement Officer had also made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.923" offset="12014985">But the key thing I think the facts in our case are unique and they lay us basically other than for the gun situation that put a squarely within the reasoning and the logic and the proposition that where laid forth with respect to Dombrowski.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.943" offset="12071096">Also the arguments for Fourth in Cooper and Harris clearly apply, that the automobile is of a different nature than somebody’s house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.345" offset="12104637">It is mobile but not only it not mobile but also because of the police contact in an non-criminal nature, that there is so much of—this is the only reasonable thing that these Officers could have done other than to just leave the car in an area where they knew that it is broken into on the past and where it could be broken into now, and then face the arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.556" offset="12181541">This whole argument about bailments and gratuitous bailee frankly, although there is a statute down in the South Dakota, it does not pertain the Police Officer, it is a statute on gratuitous bailments and it took our Supreme Court to decide that issue and even its respondents says in this argument, even after this case, there is another case before our Supreme Court to decide whether or not a Law Enforcement Officer was agreed to it as bailee and we submit that the protection of people’s property should not depend on whether or not people are gratuitous bailees or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.433" offset="12293032">And for those reasons, we would request the decision of the South Dakota Supreme Court be reversed.</text>
