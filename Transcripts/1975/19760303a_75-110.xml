            <text syncTime="74.196" offset="400113">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.278" offset="420384">My name is Stephen Tatem from El Paso, Texas and I represent the petitioner in this case that has been sued for violating United States Letters Patent entitled Dairy Establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.201" offset="480152">The patent was filed on November the 5th of 1963 and was finally issued on November the 14th of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.049" offset="519545">It has been admitted in this case and so found by the Fifth Circuit that every element in this patent consisting of 13 elements is old in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.852" offset="570745">In a part of the Fifth Circuit opinion which has validated of this patent on the basis that it exhibits novelty and is not obvious, the court has specifically said that while this honorable court rejected its rationale Graham when it validated a patent on the basis that an old result in a cheaper and otherwise more advantageous way.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.923" offset="678996">Although the court rejected that proposition, the Fifth Circuit in this case confessed that it was ignorant as to what test, if any, this Court substituted or what had struck out.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.916" offset="738973">It is submitted that this case is controlled and govern by the decisions in this case written by this Court in Anderson's-Black Rock, Graham versus John Deere, A. &amp; P. and Lincoln Engineering.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.675" offset="801981">It is our position that the Court of Appeals erred in setting aside the trail court findings on three different occasions to the affect that this combination patent did not show novelty, none obviousness and that under Rule 52, they are supported by credible evidence, were not clearly erroneous and they were reached by proper application of the law to the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.450" offset="905112">We did – it was settled in the federal courts generally that the findings of novelty well non, utility well non, obviousness well non of the District Court are subject to the standards of Rule 52 i.e. that there is findings of fact not of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.815" offset="998526">Mr. Justice, it is my understanding and I confess that I am not a patent attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.434" offset="1021096">This by chance is the first patent case that I have ever had the pleasure to be dealing with, but as I understand that law in this Court's enactment in the Graham case, while the three inquiries that are asked under Section 103 are considered factual inquiries, a final determination as to whether or not a patent is or is not valid is a question of law to which this Court and only this Court is the final arbiter.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.101" offset="1131751">I'm also of the opinion that the question of novelty would be in that same category.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="262.413" offset="1152962">Well, Mr. Tatem, I don't know if Justice Stewart feels completely satisfied with your answer to his question, but I am anyway left with some uncertainties.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.982" offset="1191205">You say, it is initially a question of fact but in the last analysis it's a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.569" offset="1213566">Does that mean only when it's so clear that reasonable people couldn't disagree or only when it falls outside a clearly erroneous standard is it a question of law or is this basically a question of law initially rather than a question of fact?</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_b_tatem_jr" startTime="295.580" stopTime="444.448">
            <label>Mr. Stephen B. Tatem, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="295.580" offset="1285664">Well, I believe that the validity of a patent is a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.219" offset="1312204">In making that determination whether it's the trial court or the Court of Appeals or in this Court of necessity in reaching the question of whether or not it is non-obvious, there are certain factual inquiries that lay the predicate as to whether or not the final decision in obvious, non-obviousness is one of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.996" offset="1415336">I think that it is relevant in understanding what is involved in this particular patent, and the only – the only means that we are talking about in this particular patent that is allegedly new and outside the prior art is the means to house or hold water at upper end of a dairy barn in a pool or on the floor so that when it – so that it can be released suddenly to flow downhill and as it flows downhill, the natural propensity of water removes manure that is on or on deposit on a concrete floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.117" offset="1599760">I think it is important for this Court to understand first, what are the basic features of what I refer to as standard grade “A” dairy barn floor plan and the reason for that is, is they are fairly standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.057" offset="1663499">They are regulated in order to be able to sell and produce grade “A” milk, you have to have certain sanitary conditions in order to be entitled to that type of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.310" offset="1708534">First basic to a modern dairy is the fact that the floor is concrete, it is paved.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.331" offset="1740613">It generally slopes downhill towards a drain.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.568" offset="1761615">The reason for that is to allow or to assist water that is on the floor to be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.377" offset="1792858">The floor itself is contoured or it is shaped to try to avoid puddles.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.628" offset="1821801">There are may or may not be groves in the concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.820" offset="1838624">The groves would allow or assist water to remove manure that maybe deposited on the floor.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.496" offset="3081321">On top of the floor are cow stalls, feeding area, milking area, and holding area and the cow of necessity needs to walk from various areas to the other -- on this concrete floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.379" offset="3144851">Also, in standard dairy barn is some type of trough or tank which holds the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.907" offset="3178915">Now, I submit to the Court, that in the mid 1960s, when the application for this particular patent was submitted, and if we look at the definition of how Webster defines flush, to mean a sudden release or washout, sudden rapid flow of water to flood, it would be most difficult to come up with a new idea that added to the sum of useful knowledge with a “flush system” because by definition, we are dealing with water that must be suddenly released as a rapid rate of flow to wash out, to flow or to flood in order to have a flush system by definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.445" offset="3401060">The respondent's expert Mr. Hubert has given us a detailed explanation of how this flush concept works.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.635" offset="3437840">It's in the appendix beginning at page 114 through 116, but its basic concept is, that when water begins to flow it creates energy which serves as a cleaning action and that the natural propensity of water as it flows downhill is to have the bottom of the water on to the floor, the top surface of the water goes faster and therefore as the water flows downhill, it has a natural cleaning action.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.372" offset="3572841">The basic propensity of water is generally related to the amount of the water released and the slope or the grade of the floor onto which it is released.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.753" offset="3618294">Now, when we get to this point in the record and it was in the record before it is in our briefs, we had cited this reference before, I think it is relevant to discuss this legend of Hercules.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.999" offset="4035313">The first of the patents is the McCornack patent which again it is much more legible that if it is looked in the blue appendix, it's much larger beginning on page 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.243" offset="4116293">McCornack patent by chance is named Dairy Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.662" offset="4137922">The patent we are talking about is Dairy Establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.472" offset="4153178">The patent to McCornack was issued on June 1st of 1937, but the McCornack patent deals with the idea of trying to save labor both as to the milking and removal of manure operation and for disposing of the manure or slurry as a natural fertilizer after the operation is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.150" offset="4263937">McCornack teaches that and they also use the word flush specifically in the specifications that the milking benches and gutters are washed, the water flows from the shoals, flushes simultaneously by means of a common valve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.369" offset="4356828">McCornack teaches that what happens is that the operator who was located near the rear of the cows steps on a foot pedal in the floor that releases the water against the shoals which flows downhill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.447" offset="4421089">I also cite the Court's attention to the patent of Bogert which begins on page five through seven of the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.778" offset="4454422">Bogert specifically deals with an apparatus for cleaning the surfaces of barns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.680" offset="4478036">Its application for patent was issued on March the 4th of 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.182" offset="4508025">Now, in the Bogert, Bogert refers to “A fluid cleaning medium” which when you read the specifications is water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.570" offset="4557553">Bogert refers to a “fluid cleaning medium supply tank” which is attached on the floor at the upper end of this particular barn, which when a ‘cap valve' and I direct the Court's attention to the visualization of this, it's very similar to the top of commode seat, it's on page 75.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.207" offset="4688165">That is his basic layout but be that as it may, this for your will commode seat is picked up by chain which causes the water to be stored in this “fluid cleaning medium supply tank” to go downhill by gravity and then enter the various gutters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.591" offset="4789625">Now, I want to point out specifically that in Bogert, which is the March 4, 1941 patent, the cows were arranged so that the manure of necessity fell into a gutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.968" offset="4855140">It did not flow onto the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.752" offset="4866320">So, therefore, the fluid from the fluid cleaning medium supply tank only flushed the gutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.730" offset="4910206">The patent in question – the cows – the manure is not necessarily deposited in such manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.170" offset="4948031">In other words it is not accumulated solely in a gutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.555" offset="4961511">So here's tank is water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.249" offset="4972273">I want to refer the Court specifically to the language of the patent office on page 13 through 15 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.050" offset="5071538">In examining these prior art publications the patent office said this, since the patent in McCormick discloses that is old in the art to flush cattle stalls and to collect for fertilizer, it is held to be an obvious expedient under 35103 to provide the (Inaudible) Dairy Establishment with such a flushing means and waste collection tank.</text>

            <text syncTime="1352.676" offset="5514053">Let me bring up what happened procedurally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.395" offset="5528890">In January of 1973, my client, who then was living in Florida, by chance was met Mr. Herbert Meyer who happen to be in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.905" offset="5582911">At that particular time in January of 1973 we had not received the decision, the second decision from the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.998" offset="5619274">In February in 1973, the Fifth Circuit reversed for the second time this patent application, I mean this patent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.651" offset="5661906">We filed at that time when we had received notice at the second case had been reversed, a motion for re-hearing addressed to the Fifth Circuit raising the question that Mr. Sakraida had only three weeks before personally met the name of the man who owned the Mission Dairy in Gonzalez California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.227" offset="5752185">It was it that time that the Fifth Circuit directed us since we were the appellee to bring this motion to the attention of the trial court because they were the only medium through which we could act to get a record, so we did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.522" offset="5833373">We filed a motion pursuant to the direction of the Fifth Circuit with the trial court in El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.389" offset="5868900">There was a different trial court that was sent from San Antonio, Texas to El Paso to receive the testimony with respect to Mr. Herbert Meyer, Mr. Bud Sakraida, Mr. Chester Whitmore, and Mr. Frank Susa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.673" offset="5933997">Those exhibits together with the pictures from Herbert Meyers Dairy are also before the Court as exhibits A through K. Following that hearing, Judge Wood, up until that time had nothing to do with this case, also entered findings of fact and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.768" offset="6010379">He found that the patent lacked novelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.086" offset="6019679">It did not meet the test of obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.349" offset="6028665">It was anticipated by this prior art and that the petitioner had exercised due diligence in discovering the name of the witnesses because they arose simply out of a by chance meeting somewhere in the State of Florida in January of 1973.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.512" offset="8561393">Well the ordinary toilet you have a bowl and then you have a pipe that comes down and bends around and that pipe comes up to approximately the level of the water in the toilet and that pipe always remains full of water, acts as a blockage or trap for any surge and when you add more water simply put more water in whether by bucket or otherwise then there is sufficient pressure and it just pushes down and it empties out the pipe that comes up.</text>

            <text syncTime="2149.985" offset="8703290">Well, I think that any cleaning whether it's by hose or whether it's by bucket or in any way, everyone has been trying to get rid of cow manure in barns for about thousands of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.370" offset="8768805">I can't tell you how long, and we know I think this is a good place to start.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.920" offset="8795032">We're considering a patent here, which is made up admittedly of a combination of mechanical elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.378" offset="8832858">And whenever we deal with a patent of that type there are number of semantic and ideological pitfalls which the courts I believe have had trouble wrestling with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.601" offset="8881759">I would suggest to you that one way of approaching this patent and perhaps avoiding some of this pitfalls is to consider first, what these two inventors did and then how they did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.707" offset="8942154">The record establishes that the best way of cleaning dairy barn floors, up until the time of this invention was by the use of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.375" offset="8992831">Now, power I mean the use of a power driven blade, a front end loader which would get all the manure together in pile and then the manure would be removed to some place and ultimately the manure had to taken and placed on the field of surrounding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.170" offset="9063989">Now in order to do proper clean up job, that type of a scraping operation had to be followed by a hosing operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.427" offset="9100978">The necessity for the hosing operation was and we're talking about commercial dairies, we're talking about dairies where there are hundreds of cows involved, is that when you scrape a floor which has been covered with manure you leave a thin slippery fill and this is exceedingly dangerous to the cows as well as to anybody who's walking on it so you have to follow up this scraping operation with a hosing operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.561" offset="9205573">Now, once you've done that, you then have to get rid of it and still you haven't solved the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.931" offset="9247055">Now you could of course start by hosing and that sometimes is done but that won't work on 300 foot alley way, because once you start hosing I think as any of you know, you are starting to splash things all over the place and besides that all that you do by a hosing operation is to force it into piles and in the end even your hose is not going to dislodge these piles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.952" offset="9355098">So what did these two inventors do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.892" offset="9366905">They came along and they solved the problem and the record shows that to clean up a comfortable alley way, three or four hundred feet long, would take 4 or 5 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.809" offset="9418523">Literally in one minute, according to the patented invention, just as long as it takes to wave my hand, you've cleaned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.310" offset="9468573">Now what you've done is you have substituted for hours of disagreeable miserable layer, a shining clean floor that takes no time, no effort, no money and satisfies all of the sanitary requirements plus being ecologically extremely sound because what you've done according to the system is you put the manure in a form so that it can be put through it, sprinklers system and put on the surrounding fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.484" offset="9609217">Now what I have described is precisely what Gribble and Bennett invented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.915" offset="9626980">This is what they contributed to the dairy industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.598" offset="9641713">Now, let me pick up where my brother Tatum did, with respect to these two prior art effects and these were Mr. Chief Justice, in the record before the district court, it is undisputed that they are properly before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3595.501" offset="14485338">In fact, the Fifth Circuit found that there was really no evidence to support the findings of the District Court and that brings me to the question of the newly discovered evidence which there are good procedural as well as substantive reasons I think for rejecting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.882" offset="14562869">The first one is the jurisdictional question which I have raised with respect to whether or not this is properly here and that is in my brief – that is a pure jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.243" offset="14608322">I admit I raised it for the first time here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.598" offset="14617726">I didn't think about it before but it is jurisdictional and the Court of course is always interested in the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.113" offset="14647715">The second one was that the documents which were introduced at the hearing on newly discovered evidence should have been rejected because those documents were deliberately withheld and not shown to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.743" offset="14694317">There was a Rule 34 motion made to have the defendant disclose all of his evidence, documentary evidence, which he may have on prior art that would have covered role view with one and all the rest that was not disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.956" offset="14763176">Thirdly, with respect to the Mission Dairy and to Mr. Meyer's testimony, Mr. Meyer and the Mission Dairy were admittedly the key to all the newly discovered evidence because Mr. Meyer was the one who knew about it all and would tie the whole thing together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.904" offset="14822944">There is not any question that the defendant, as well as the attorney knew about the Mission Dairy in October of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.345" offset="14872681">At that time, he made a deliberate choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.014" offset="14883339">I don't need the Mission Dairy to win this case and therefore he did not use the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.253" offset="14904342">He went through a motion for summary judgment did not use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.310" offset="14916567">Two years later, he went through a trial and he did not use this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.673" offset="14934017">After the Court of Appeals for the second time reversed and said the patent is invalid, he splits back and said ah but I have some newly discovered evidence which I want the court to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.818" offset="14974559">The court very generously I think sent it back to the district court for a hearing under 60(b)(2) and there simply said, “Oh, we are not going to let all the evidence in and never pass the threshold question which Mr. Justice Stewart brought up is this newly discovered evidence because there are very strict requirements under 60(b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.437" offset="15061076">The threshold questions were never satisfied with the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.250" offset="15072361">In fact, they would never answered because under 60(b)(2), you have to show one, it has newly discovered two, it could not have been discovered by due diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.434" offset="15117083">In this case, there isn't any question; they knew about it and it did not take due diligence to find out who the owner of the Mission Dairy was when he knew about the Mission Dairy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.029" offset="15155431">What he had to do was to take a deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.329" offset="15168596">So, I think that under any test whether it is even the Juno test, that very controversial flash of genius test which this Court handed down –-</text>

            <text syncTime="3838.528" offset="15457406">They had nothing and they succeeded in building up a reputable business which has received good commercial acceptance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.609" offset="15497739">Interestingly enough, this case has none of the odes features which some of the cases before this court involving patents may have had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.111" offset="15531803">They made the patent available to anybody practically for nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.942" offset="15551029">All that they asked was that you pay them a fee, a one time fee of $1,500 plus one dollar per cow and that meant that anybody could get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.155" offset="15591884">An installation of 300 cows cost $250,000 and the rent or the charge would be $1,800 once and that is all.</text>
