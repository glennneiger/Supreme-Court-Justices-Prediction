            <text syncTime="15.206" offset="134499">This case is here from the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. During negotiations for renewal of an expired collective bargaining agreement, petitioner union and it's members engaged and a concerted refusal to work overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.967" offset="217464">The employer filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board, but that charge was dismissed on the ground that the refusal to work overtime did not violate the National Labor Relation's Act, and therefore, was not conduct cognizable by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.425" offset="299384">At the same time, however, the employer had filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the respondent Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission and that commission held that the refusal to work overtime, while neither protected nor prohibited by the National Labor Relation's Act, was nevertheless an unfair labor practice under state law and the commission, therefore, entered a cease and desist order against the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.513" offset="415681">The Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.255" offset="426653">We reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.108" offset="434071">We hold that the union's concerted refusal to work overtime was peaceful conduct constituting activity free not only of National Labor Relations Board Regulation, but also free of state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.978" offset="505542">Congress meant that self help economic activities, whether of employer or employee, were not to be regulable by States anymore then by the National Labor Relation's Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.388" offset="567191">The so called Briggs-Stratton case, Automobile Workers versus Wisconsin Board in 336 United States insofar as contrary is today overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.876" offset="625183">Mr. Justice Powell, joining the Court opinion, has filed a concurring opinion in Mr. Chief Justice has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.485" offset="659560">Mr. Justice Stevens filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Rehnquist joined.</text>
