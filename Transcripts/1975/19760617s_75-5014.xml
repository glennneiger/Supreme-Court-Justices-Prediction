            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="15.328" offset="134895">These two criminal cases, involving identical circumstances are here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.632" offset="168123">When the defendants were arrested, they were given the customary Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.907" offset="189230">These included advice that they had the right to remain silent, that anything they said could be used against them and that and they had a right to counsel before submitting to interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.816" offset="240848">At that trial, the defendants took the stand and offered for the first time a novel explanation of their conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.144" offset="274180">If believed, this explanation would clear them of criminality.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.734" offset="296541">On cross examination, the prosecutor pressed defendants as to why they had not advised the police at the time of arrest of exculpatory facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.643" offset="340217">The inference sought to be drawn by the prosecutor, was that defendant's silence at the time of arrest indicated that, their present story was a fabrication.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.421" offset="387342">The Trial Court allowed the cross examination, the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.083" offset="413987">We now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.017" offset="421720">When as required by law an arrested person is advised of his right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.260" offset="446693">We think it fundamentally unfair and a denial of Due Process to allow the arrested person's silence to be used to impeach exculpatory testimony offered at the Trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.587" offset="496012">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. justice Blackmun and Mr. justice Rehnquist have joined.</text>
