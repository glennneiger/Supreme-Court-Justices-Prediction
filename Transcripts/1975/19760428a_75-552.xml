            <text syncTime="62.856" offset="354761">Mr. Randolph, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Randolph</label>
            <text syncTime="66.097" offset="367718">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.049" offset="383496">This case, which is here on writs of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, arises under the National Environmental Policy Act which I referred to as NEPA throughout my argument, this provides that an environmental impact statement shall be included in every report or recommendation on proposals for major Federal actions significantly affecting the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.911" offset="474925">The Federal petitioners violated the provision I have just quoted, according to the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.790" offset="502510">Because they have not prepared one of massive impact statement covering all Federal activities relating to coal mining, in an area respondents called the Northern Great Plains region.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.976" offset="543261">That is a 90,000 square mile area describing their complaint as comprising North Eastern Wyoming, Eastern Montana, Western North Dakota and Western South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.703" offset="582131">I have had distributed to the Court two maps, both of these maps were taken from material on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.406" offset="604910">I do not plan to refer to them now, later in my argument, I will refer to them directly. On cross motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled in favor of the government in the interveners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.792" offset="658513">Among the Court's many findings of fact at this stage and on remand for supplementing the record, two findings of fact, we believe are crucial and dispositive in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.111" offset="703757">First, that the Northern Great Plains region, defined by respondents is not “an entity, region or area, considered by the Federal Government for the purposes of any Federal program, project or action, second, that there is no existing or proposed Federal Regional program, plan, project or other regional Federal action for developing coal in the region respondents have defined”.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.866" offset="810755">The District Court with respect to these two findings of fact could not have found otherwise, our evidence was to this effect in the District Court and respondents with out offering any other contrary evidence not only conceded that no plan or program for development of their Northern Great Plains region existed, they stressed that fact, they argued to the District Court, they argued to the Court of Appeals that NEPA compelled the government to adopt such regional plan or proposal, an argument that in this Court they now have extensively dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.324" offset="948577">I will mention briefly a number of the other District Courts findings of fact and then proceed in my argument and these were findings taken both from the original proceeding in the District Court and from the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.179" offset="992045">One, that the government has prepared and will continue to prepare environmental impact statements for group of mines or individual mines within the area described in respondents complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.630" offset="1037811">These impact statements, the Court found to be, at page 114 (a) and 115 (a) of the petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.195" offset="1076055">These statements the Court found to be comprehensive and noted that they assess the cumulative impacts of coal mining and related activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.884" offset="1110850">One of the statements, impact statements that the District Court considered is the six volume Eastern Powder River Basin impact statement and through the benefit of the Court, this is before the Court, but, I brought a copy in so the Court might see what an impact statement looks like, all six volumes, they -- it covers an area in Wyoming of approximately, I cannot lift it, I would but[Laughter]</text>

          <turn speaker="randolph" startTime="287.561" stopTime="553.043">
            <label>Mr. Randolph</label>
            <text syncTime="287.561" offset="1253583">This covers an area in North Eastern Wyoming of approximately 7500 square miles, which is about the size of the State of New Jersey, the focus is on four mining plans and a railroad right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.109" offset="1307708">As I said, the District Court found that that statement was comprehensive and had such cumulative impacts of coal mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.453" offset="1329129">The District Court found in addition that since of 1970, the government, the Federal government in cooperation with States Industry, private groups, other individuals, local governments had conducted various coal related studies in the Western States.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.951" offset="1387121">This was studied only, I must emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.299" offset="1396525">One of these which was primarily mentioned in the briefs and also in opinions below is the Northern Great Plains Resources Program, the NGPRP is sometimes referred, which was began in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.429" offset="1457024">This was a joint investigation by the States of Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota that collected data on geology, minerals, including coal, and mainly coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.333" offset="1508642">Air quality, social and economic conditions and so forth and analyzed all this material on the basis of possible development scenarios, the study or the program as I should refer to proposed no regional plan, it suggested no preferred development program, it suggested no development program whatsoever, it was not designed to the District Court so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.577" offset="1609579">The District Court also found that since 1973, the Secretary of Interior had continued in effect but was a virtual moratorium a private coal development, a new private coal development in the federal coal reserves throughout the Country.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.718" offset="1670183">During this period at a national impact statement or as it sometimes referred to a coal programmatic was prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.883" offset="1706859">This assessed, the old procedures that the secretary had utilize under the mineral leasing act and formulated a new process applicable Nationwide for implementing that same Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.488" offset="1757223">On the basis of this evidence the District Court found that the government had taken action under NEPA, but it was National action in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.974" offset="1791183">The action was on a National basis as to the region, that we are discussing in this case, the District Court found as I stressed before, there was no special plan or program for that reason as such and certainly no regional action.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.430" offset="1849070">The Court of Appeals reversed with one judge dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.686" offset="1862027">The Court majority accepted the law records findings of fact but held that the government was and I used the Court's word contemplating a regional program.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.899" offset="1898912">The relevance of this apparently was that under the lower Courts, Court of Appeals view an impact statement under the statute NEPA must be issued well and advance of any report on proposals for major Federal action, there ago contemplation could trigger the impact statement requirement, must stress though that the Court of Appeals did not hold that the government had yet violated NEPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.576" offset="1997655">But only that it would if it kept following the course that the Court thought it was following and in light of this the Court issued a remand order, instructed the government to announce whether it would do one impact statement covering this 90,000 square mile area.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.907" offset="2062961">In January, this Court staid the Court of Appeals injunction which had prevented the Secretary of Interior from taking action with respect to the four pending mining plans analyzed in the Eastern Powder River Basin impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.620" offset="2117818">Thereafter in February of this year, the secretary approved those four mining plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.272" offset="2140388">As I stated at the outset we think that the District Court's decision on this case is correct and we think that the District Courts findings affect in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.344" offset="2176646">The government has completed a national impact statement covering a coal leasing policies nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.146" offset="2207888">It includes in analysis the four States here it includes an analysis of every State where Federal land is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.290" offset="2232443">It has completed this massive impact statements covering the Eastern Powder River Basin in Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.518" offset="2257416">That statement has not been challenged in any Court, in fact the statement covers three quarters of all the economically recoverable coal by strip-mining in the area that respondents defined as the Northern Great Plains region.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.043" offset="2315512">Does the government concede that it was required by the act to file a national impact statement?</text>

            <text syncTime="560.830" offset="2346650">It was a national program and it was major Federal action but it was Nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.483" offset="2365250">It is been filed -- that government also has issued impact statements for individual mines, for clusters of mines and in fact will continue to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.805" offset="2422510">The argument here however is that none of this is sufficient, that an impact statement must be done for an area smaller than the United States but larger than the Eastern Powder River Basin which is the size on the State of New Jersey as I stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.587" offset="2485622">Even if respondents are right that would be a good idea and we do not think it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.081" offset="2507669">We do think that the National Environmental Policy Act is not mandated.</text>

            <text syncTime="610.545" offset="2545495">As was pointed out in another case during the argument yesterday in the language of the 102 (2)(c) is little -- it does not say anything about filing an impact statement it just says, it shall include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.441" offset="2637028">I guess, the language recommendation or report on proposals for qualifies other major Federal actions or may be it does not but what has become, -- my question is, what has the government done with this big impact, national impact statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="650.377" offset="2704841">It has filled anywhere?</text>

            <text syncTime="673.928" offset="2798987">In 41 Fed. Reg. 11035 in March of this year, a series of regulations implementing the proposals and suggestions and the formulated policy that the National impacts statements prepares.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.065" offset="2851545">So, in other words they did an impact statement, they assessed the National Coal policy and in 41 Federal Register they have now published regulations which the secretary expects to implement taking the suggestions and putting into the policy of the environmental fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="798.104" offset="3295731">The District Court found none of the private applications are for regional action.</text>

            <text syncTime="813.503" offset="3357276">The National Coal Leasing Program we have discussed but we have done an impact statement on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.329" offset="3376606">At lease, only the approval of particular leases, mining plans, rights of way and so forth, to be sure these have to be the subject of environmental impact statements and they will be if they are not already the subject of environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.936" offset="3439091">But, in the absence of a proposal for regional action and a report on that kind of a proposal, NEPA does not require a regional impact statement, otherwise, realize what a Court is saying to the Federal Agency, it is saying, well, you do not have a regional development program but we are going to order you to do a regional impact statement evaluating the environmental effects of the regional action, you would have planned, if you have a regional a program.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.222" offset="3556224">And, on top of that, since NEPA requires you to consider alternatives, we are going to ask you, direct you to consider the alternatives to the regional action, you do not have planned but you would have planned if you had.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.557" offset="7057573">The very existence for the Bureau of Land Management, the very reason for the existence of Bureau of Land Management of course is to manage the Federal Lands and they are constantly studying the resources and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.334" offset="7104593">The Bureau of Mines is not really a regulatory agency, it is really a research agency and they conduct studies all the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.447" offset="7141060">I think all the Federal land at one point or another is under constant analysis and study for coal mines, for various things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.496" offset="7165302">So, we do not think that would require an impact statement, I think the result of that would deter the governmental agencies from studying the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.761" offset="7198321">Now, suppose, everything I have told the Court, at least in the argument portion so far, suppose I am mistaken, suppose I am wrong, suppose the Court of Appeals accurately detected that a regional development plan is in fact contemplated and that, it just so happens that this regional plan, the government is supposedly pondering corresponds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1807.039" offset="7331441">The fact is NEPA does not say or even imply that an impact statement must be done on contemplation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.574" offset="7361638">NEPA does not say that an impact statement must be done when that contemplation somehow mystically arises to the level of a proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.247" offset="7396329">What the statute does say, Mr. Justice Stewart pointed this out early in my argument, it says that an impact statement must be done included in a report on the proposal and Scrap Two, this Court decision in Scrap Two said and held “the statute means what it says”, I quote from the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.203" offset="7472084">The time at which an agency must prepared the final statement is the time at which it makes a recommendation or report on a proposal for Federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.986" offset="7515238">Even under the Court of Appeals opinion which said the only thing that exists here is some contemplation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.766" offset="7558392">We said, we would submit it will never arrive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.525" offset="7573439">The Court below, we think therefore, should have affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.790" offset="7610428">It was improper for that Court to continue the injunction which prevented the Secretary of Interior from taking actions that have already been fully analyzed and what the District Court found to be a comprehensive impact statement that assesses the cumulative consequences of coal mining.</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.721" offset="7746161">I am here today on behalf of the State of Wyoming and 21 other amicus States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.346" offset="7768730">Because we have a lot of stake we think in the decision that this Court reaches in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.943" offset="7791091">We believe that NEPA contemplates a major state role in the implementation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.380" offset="7820871">We know, from experience that the impact of the Federal Programs on our States are tremendous and we believe that program environmental impact statements are truly the only means that we have of determining the scope and the magnitude of these Federal programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.474" offset="7909165">We think that interior, the Department of the Interior would defeat those objectives by preparing environmental impact statements under NEPA on a project by project basis, and that is our understanding of the real issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.678" offset="7969978">Now, let me tell you a little bit about the Wyoming experience and what is happening on ground in my State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.917" offset="7999026">At last count, we have no fewer than 134 coal leases, pending applications or prospecting permits in the Eastern Powder River Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.728" offset="8046255">Projections for the next few years in the North Eastern part of our State call for 34 strip mines, nine electric power and coal gasification plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.741" offset="8082304">225 miles of new power lines and 150 miles of new rail road track.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.224" offset="8112188">We respectfully submit that it is ridiculous to think that a series of environmental impact statements on each one of those particular projects, all of which require either directly or indirectly Federal action before they can come into fruition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.580" offset="8181674">We think it is ridiculous to think that a series of environmental impacts statements on those  projects will analyze what is going to happen to our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.546" offset="8213543">In the same way that an environmental impact statement taking all of them into consideration and determining the cumulative effect of all of those projects would it have.</text>

            <text syncTime="4951.622" offset="19909818">And, this is exactly what Secretary Kleppe is saying today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.620" offset="19937821">Now, indeed, of course the studies are going all the time and what they finally decide on is what subject they will, what major Federal action they will decide to carry forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.985" offset="20007202">Now, I would like to ask the Court if it will to return to the statute and to Scrap Two which it seems to me says that the statute means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.776" offset="20086406">And I would like to suggest to the Court that there is a very different question presented on what is, what interior is compelled to do, what they must do under this statute and what they find it wise to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.544" offset="20185462">Now, they may find it wise to prepare particularly regional statements rather than the statement on a particular project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.143" offset="20239901">Incidentally, I think all the Secretary has said he’s going to do is to, is he thinks prepare a couple of more regional statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.229" offset="20284205">I believe in his response to questions put to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.119" offset="20303744">But that distinction it seems to me has to be kept in mind which I think your question posed and suggested and, I would like to -- I am not sure that these matter is not well in mind from the questions that the Court has put.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.928" offset="20399039">But looking to 102 (2) (c), this is what compulsory and all that is compulsory that they will be included in every recommendation, a report on proposals for major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of human environment and what is to be included, the environmental impact of the proposed action, any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="5119.068" offset="20579597">Alternatives to the proposed action, any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.081" offset="20639679">Now, if the Court please in Scrap II if I understood correctly, the tolling, stitching, the Court said that if we want to determine what kind of an impact statement is to be prepared we must first define accurately what the proposed major Federal action is, and secondly, that in circumstances such as exist there and exist here where the proposals where by private companies that the recommendation of the proposal for major Federal action is the approval of those applications for in scrap II in failure to suspend but the approval of those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.247" offset="20896306">Now, gentleman, I suggest that it is impossible to read 102 (2) (c), I should not say impossible but it seems to me very difficult to read 102 (2) (c) as relating to something other than a specific proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.891" offset="20994840">The approval of mining lease, but how you can read this as saying, that it covers prior action, that covers applications which are pending, which has no commitment to approve, can you read the environmental impact of the proposed action as saying the environmental impact of all prior actions and all applications for leases and for rights of way, for mining plants, can you say that any irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources which would be involved in the proposed action that you can read in to that all the actions which have been taken in the way of leases and mining plants et cetera and all of those applications which are pending that there is no commitment to approve which may or may not be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.341" offset="21320639">I suggest the Court, that it is not to be so read.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.496" offset="21345299">Now, to be sure as Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested and I think as Mr. Justice Stevens suggested, when there is indeed the recommendation of a proposal, of a particular mining plant for instance, well, that is approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.835" offset="21426696">It must deal with the situation which is approved if this adds further impact on the environment that breaks the camels back, a portion you got to look at what the circumstances are what the cumulative effect it is, and if it is claimed that impact statements is inadequate, it can be claimed that it is inadequate, because it does not give consideration to the cumulative effects but may I say again that this does not mean that the Secretary is under obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.525" offset="21629406">He may do it because it is the wise Course, it is the most desirable way of managing it but this is quite different from saying that these under obligation to prepare a regional impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5400.592" offset="21705684">Now, he would be under an obligation of preparing regional impact statement, if that constituted if a plan had been, if he had a plan, which involved the entire region that he was carrying in effect except that as you know that the decisions of the Courts, the Court of Appeals have held that even where you had such as thing as two phases of tea tongs (ph) or where you have the simply Utah project, if part authorized by the Congress, if part of that has independent utility, a single impact statement on that part having independent utility and which does not commit you to go forward and finish the entire project, can be supported by an impact statement which is limited to that part.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.187" offset="21972028">Now, therefore I would submit your Honors and I did have the  feeling that this was brought in the course of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.718" offset="22014138">Then you have got to find a proposal, the proposal has not so far as I could hear, and brought your attention by opposing council nor by the Court below, and what he talked about, the Court below said was all of these prior approvals, all of these things in being, all of the applications which are pending and the studies which have been made, that these indicate that Interior is contemplating control.</text>
