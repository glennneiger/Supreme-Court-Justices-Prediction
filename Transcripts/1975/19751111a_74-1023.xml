            <text syncTime="1512.852" offset="6154697">The other half of the coin of course is our position, is that the Court can deny in this case the discovery without looking at the documents, but cannot grant it without looking at the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.196" offset="6204120">And the reason for that is that the case in a District Court is not a case of a single inmate attacking his parole consideration procedure, where he needs to know the documents considered at that procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.379" offset="14100832">But secondly, that the obligation of an agency resisting discovery to submit a proper claim and to make a specific showing in the District Court that those documents do in fact come in within the governmental privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.860" offset="14146808">Now our position can be stated quite simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.444" offset="14157152">Of course, the District Judge has the obligation to make an informed determination, but as a practical matter, he can make that informed determination only if the party resisting discovery, the government agency which has complete custody of the documents, makes the type of detailed showing which the cases require and which they did not even attempt in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.391" offset="14244923">And I would like to note that the questions asked from the bench to my opponents this morning, what the files contain, what sort of documents are they, what sort of harm could come.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.509" offset="14281390">Those are precisely the things that the District Judge needed to know, precisely the facts that the resisting party was obligated to give him and exactly the detailed showing that the resisting party here refused to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.190" offset="14340114">In other words, the requirement that a resisting party make a strong showing, the documents are privileged, it is not a mere technical requirement—</text>

            <text syncTime="3578.520" offset="14417436">To show that there is, for example a privilege, regardless of what device is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.795" offset="14438543">Moreover, we put these defendants on notice right at the beginning of this case, in our Rule 37 papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.873" offset="14458814">That they had to make a proper claim by the agency head that they had to make a specific showing, but this they never did throughout the entire litigation in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.293" offset="14496535">For example, in the District Court, these defendants failed in the first instance to give the Judge any idea of the dimension of the problem, how many documents were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.674" offset="14529972">Failed to submit a formal claim by the agency head, after personal considerations setting forth considered agency policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.991" offset="14559333">Failed to even identify the specific documents involved for the discovering party or for the court, failed to separate the documents into privileged to non-privileged portions and then correlate their claim of privilege to those portions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.073" offset="14615653">Failed to spell out the specific harm, which would be caused if these documents were produced subject to the protective order, which Judge Weigel carefully drew, and failed to show why the protective orders recommended by the magistrate and adopted by the Judge would not be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.131" offset="14675839">And indeed at one point, between the time when the magistrate recommended a protective order that would limit the inspection of the documents to anyone in our office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.910" offset="14710948">The other side suggested that it ought to be changed to be limited to two counsel and two investigators and Judge Weigel entered an order, to one investigator excuse me, limiting it to two counsel and two investigators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.146" offset="14759954">Therefore the obvious irony, as well as the fundamental legal deficiency of defendants claim here of judicial abdication is that it was their refusal to follow the law and to provide the District Judge with the information, he needed which created this situation about which they now complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.269" offset="14832365">Now, at this point, in the analysis the defendants would disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.756" offset="14846367">They would say, they would point to their persistent request in the District Court that the Judge inspect these documents in camera, and their subsequent insistence in the Court of Appeals and in this Court that his refusal to do so constituted an abdication of his responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.624" offset="14913867">Now, to most people including some lawyers and perhaps even Judges, an in camera inspection sounds like a reasonable way to make an informed equitable determination of this type of dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.022" offset="14959425">However, a moment’s reflection will show that there are at least three serious problems inherent in any in camera inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.783" offset="14994429">Problems which the defendants and the District Court did not even acknowledge much less attempt to cure and they are first it is a serious problem obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.232" offset="15028283">Not only on the trial court but on the appellate court to go through however many documents maybe involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.120" offset="15051794">Secondly, by all but eliminating the adversary process an in camera inspection bravely discovered the prejudice of the discovering party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.555" offset="15101531">And thirdly, this is of crucial importance in our view, in a Rule 34 litigation situation unlike a Freedom of Information at case, the Judge cannot know at the discovery stage what documents or what portions of what documents are relevant to the plaintiffs’ case because he doesn’t know such crucial things as what information plaintiffs have in other depositions, who the witnesses are going to be, what they need to impeach the witnesses with and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.609" offset="15205812">So after you look at it for a while, you see that it is a very typical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.325" offset="15236636">Now, it is for this reason that the lower federal courts, especially the DC Circuits which gets most of these request, in the case of Vaughn Vs. Rosen which we cite in our brief and others is beginning to require even in the FOIA Cases, a detailed breakdown of the documents separating them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.453" offset="15317093">Showing which portions are privileged and which are not, cross referencing the claims of the privileged to those portions allegedly non-disclosable in this situation and setting forth an evidentiary basis for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.716" offset="15366203">Now, clearly if this happens, this is necessary in order to decrease the burden on the Court and in order to give a maximumly fair chance to the discovering party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.729" offset="15434226">And what we ask is that if this Court reaches that issue, because after all, all the Court of Appeals said was its limited modest holding was that these defendants hadn’t made the proper showing in the District Court and indeed upon remand they still have that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.226" offset="15504235">If this Court affirms on that ground, it may or may not discuss the requisites for an in camera inspection, and our request is that if this Court reaches that issue and discusses in its opinion that question, that it give concern to the very real problems of in camera inspection, not just the general ones experienced by any freedom of information act by the plaintiff, but the additional much more difficult naughty ones experienced by a litigant in a Rule 34 situation who is seeking these documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="4011.602" offset="16149772">Their position is that with the central files, unlike other documents, they have no time to look through and make a submission to the Court, but this is the chronology of events that had to do with the central files and it is all in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="4046.451" offset="16289162">During that time the other side made no motion to go into court to say here are the documents we think are privileged and why, to make any showing whatsoever, they simply withheld them from us.</text>

            <text syncTime="4073.938" offset="16399085">Indeed as late as November 20th they filed a counter motion, this is at appendix at 590, trying to get the Judge once again to reconsider and say that these documents were confidential.</text>

            <text syncTime="4573.348" offset="18396721">I would be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.115" offset="18411768">Counsel spoke of the necessity under the District Court’s orders for there to be consent of the inmates whose files are to be inspected and that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.223" offset="18448235">However, as of indicated the files contained documents persons other than that inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.327" offset="18472685">They contain crime partner information, they contain information from informants against the inmates whose file is to be inspected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4599.292" offset="18500479">That inmate’s consent is irrelevant as to those other documents; he cannot consent to the disclosure of documents which he has not generated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.931" offset="18543007">Now, the counsel has stated here that we would have no objection, if in the District Court there was some showing made of the confidentiality of the contents of the inmate’s files, and if some particular document were withheld and to be shown to the Court on upon a proper showing, we would have no objection to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.169" offset="18636003">That is precisely what we did, that is precisely what precipitated this attorney’s motion for enforcement, clarification and sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.983" offset="18679261">That is precisely what precipitated, Judge Weigel threatening me in open court with contempt if I tried it again, and that is precisely what precipitated the strident language of the District Court in the December 3 order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.729" offset="18734223">This was done and it was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.404" offset="18744986">It was rejected by the Ninth Circuit in its denial of mandamus in that separate mandamus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.992" offset="18779258">Now if we go back to the District Court as the law presently stands, we are in the same relatively helpless position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.053" offset="18819591">The opinion in Kerr is not helpful, it is a denial of mandamus and nothing more, there is some dicta in the opinion but the dicta adds nothing to the state of the laws at that time, these events began.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.422" offset="18881031">I feel with respect to, particularly the inmate documents, and with respect to the contents of the personnel files, more must be required of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.303" offset="18964519">The background and information to which counsel has expressed an interest has been furnished in abundance to plaintiffs, the complete work backgrounds, the complete educational backgrounds were furnished in response to interrogatories with statements and documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.192" offset="19036094">Each member of the adult authority has been deposed at length by plaintiffs, the deposition is focused on two things; their backgrounds and their attitudes and the procedures each individual follows at parole consideration hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.872" offset="19094817">How they get into the file, what they look at, how they weigh this, how they weigh that, they have this information to a fairly well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.918" offset="19123030">And there is no excuse to have demanded everything in every personnel file, everything in every inmate file and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.852" offset="19170781">We submit that the District Court has not acted reasonably with respect to these documents, again the confidential nature of which is conceded and has been continuously below.</text>
