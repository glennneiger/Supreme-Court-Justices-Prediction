            <text syncTime="57.101" offset="331671">In 1966, this Court in the case of United Mine Worker versus Gibbs clarified and explained the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.371" offset="372840">In this lengthy and comprehensive opinion, the Court referred to the joinder of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.079" offset="395619">It did not refer to the joinder of parties specifically and that raises the issue that is before you today.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.511" offset="545353">Now, the very simple facts of this case raise the issue quite clearly and I would like to set them forth very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.235" offset="572207">The petitioner was fired from her public position in the County Treasurers Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.910" offset="590910">The County Treasurer fired her and then published in a letter that her work was excellent but that she had been living with her boyfriend, that this is un-true as of no importance to this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.523" offset="2317395">Now, the District Court recognized the problems that it had and it dismissed the State Law claims without getting to the merits of them in the way that it felt would be the clearest possible way to point out the incongruity that exists in the Federal System.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.472" offset="2377163">The order of the dismissal states it very clearly that he did not get to the merits and that he dismissed solely because he has not the power and he included the Rule 54 (b) certificate and a certificate pursuant to 28 U.S. Code 1292.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.273" offset="2428363">We went directly to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit who affirmed and certiorari by this Court was granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.914" offset="2474966">Now the incongruity that the Court tried to point out was that the Gibbs case is being misconstrued and misapplied in two clearly opposing and exclusive ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.993" offset="2519270">The joinder of claims very easily could contemplate the joinder of parties in a number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.511" offset="2541317">And the majority of the Circuits and District Courts have held that, inappropriate cases parties are accidentally joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.619" offset="2565768">The Ninth Circuit however has ruled that there is absolutely no power to join parties and these claims cannot be joined, no matter what the circumstance, no matter how closely related to the Federal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.019" offset="2619371">The Ninth Circuit admits that support for its position is eroding and this Court pointed out in Moor v. County of Alameda that the Ninth Circuit stood virtually alone in its inflexible lack of power theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.367" offset="2676736">Well, the answer to this question is a difficult one and it requires this Court to put itself in the place of the District Courts that contend daily with a very heavy docket and a very large trial case load.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.125" offset="2739848">The answer that the District Courts have found in many cases is to join all possible claims that are related to one another and try them all in one suit and dispose off them simultaneously and pendent jurisdiction allows them to do this, especially pendent jurisdiction with respect to the joinder of parties.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald C. Brockett</label>
            <text syncTime="1879.546" offset="7621506">Now the attempt in this particular case and I think again this is the poorest case where this Court to be deciding the matter of pendent jurisdiction in attaching a state claim to a federal claim because of the fact that the complaint itself alleges an absence of a state claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.581" offset="7697679">In fact as this Court has noted the Revised Code of Washington 36.16.070 specifically provides that the treasurer of Spokane County as any other elected official of Spokane County has the discretion to discharge at pleasure an employee and what counsel is asking in this case, what petitioner is asking is that the particular statute when and if it is ruled to be unconstitutional, or to have been applied in an unconstitutional manner would then create a state claim against the county for the action of the treasurer and would then ask that that state claim may be made pendent to the federal cause action which has been filed under the Federal Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.588" offset="7885657">The difficulty that the county expresses here is as much the same as the difficulty expressed to this in Court in Moor versus County of Alameda, that there is to be a system of federalism, that there is to be a distinction between the State and Federal Courts and that as Justice Rehnquist, I believe said in a recent opinion, if such an extension of pendent jurisdiction as this would allow to bring in to the case an additional party that this Court has held should not be a person under the federal civil rights action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.556" offset="8029539">That that would only call for ingenious counsel to determine that there was a federal question and then determine that there should be pendent jurisdiction over any state claim that might be thought to exist and therefore would go into the Federal Court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.096" offset="8103727">The questions of jurisdiction are questions of course, of constitutional law and it has been determined and it has been written specifically in Article 3, Section 2 of the Constitution that the Federal Courts are Courts of limited jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.815" offset="8170600">Many of the writers on the extension of pendent jurisdiction and ancillary jurisdiction and the confusion between the two doctrines have indicated and the county would propose here that the Federal Court system is becoming a system of general jurisdiction by means of the use of pendent jurisdiction to allow the joining of state claims in particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.787" offset="8270492">And it is especially an extension which I do not believe this Court wishes to exercise in this case because it would join a party which has specific been held not to be a person under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.909" offset="8338933">The problems created by the extension of pendent jurisdiction are many and have been mentioned in various writings and I think this Court should certainly consider those problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.132" offset="8379789">Number one, the major problem is that if the State Court in considering a question of federal law should err in interpreting the federal law then it can be corrected on review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.880" offset="8434855">However, if the Federal District Court would err in interpreting a state law that particular question is not subject to review by the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.301" offset="8484488">And therefore this Court should consider that question and force these causes of action to be tried on the basis of state claims in State Courts with an appropriate review by this court or other Federal Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2148.317" offset="8696602">There is some questioning of that particular doctrine at present time because of the movement of society in the present day and the fact that there are many lawsuits that are brought in local jurisdictions that are in fact holding police officers liable for their conduct and I would warrant in this particular case if the facts warranted would hold the treasurer and the County liable for any tortuous conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2347.411" offset="9492919">I think that this Court should find that ancillary jurisdiction certainly has a role to play in the federal jurisdictional scheme of things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2381.669" offset="9630009">The pendent jurisdiction problem however, whether it extends to claims as it was extended in this Court by Moor versus County of Alameda or more importantly whether it extends to parties who are not properly a party to the particular action as we allege, the County of Spoken is not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.889" offset="9710884">The Court should distinguish between those doctrines and we would submit, it should overrule the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction and not allow it within the Federal Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2638.379" offset="10656830">I think the Ninth Circuit Court does in fact as this District Court has said before virtually stands alone in determining that the pendent jurisdiction may not be extended to pendent parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.746" offset="10706254">And that is the determination to be made in this case if this Court determines that this is an appropriate case in which to make that determination itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.948" offset="10743139">We would contend that the doctrine of removable that the doctrines of abstention and certification by the Federal District Courts are doctrines that have in fact grown up as result of the fact that the Courts do not want to exercise jurisdiction over the State law claims and that they themselves feel that these claims should be better placed in the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.824" offset="10838643">That the State Court should make state law that if that law then is interrogation of federal rights that it will be ruled upon by the Federal Courts and will be appealed to this particular Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.000" offset="10887335">That otherwise the States should not have the right to rule on their own State law and as the Chief Justice has mentioned because of the Court dockets that are very crowded the Courts and Judges are required to move around and may well be in a State and diversity case for example and not be that familiar with the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.647" offset="10977928">The Federal Court ruling upon the question of a state law may be looked to by a state legislature to give some guidance to it when in fact the state legislature should not be looking to the Federal Court determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.822" offset="11030590">That determination should be made properly by a State Court with a review under our constitutional system and system of federalism by the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.425" offset="11073013">The petitioner in this case in the reply brief has indicated that it is absurd for the respondent to contend that this extension of the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction is being used to extend the scope of a 1983 action, Section 1983 of the United State Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.317" offset="11148559">We would contend that that is not so absurd when one looks at 15 (m) jury trials 620 at Section 27 which states this, pendent jurisdiction is used for two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.426" offset="11201013">One, to try common law or statutory tort claims against individual defendants sued under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.018" offset="11231420">And two, to bring the city or other entity into the action thus avoiding in part the holding of Monroe versus Pape, that cities are not suable under Section 1983, we would contend that that is exactly what is happening in the Federal Court System, and by the use of the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction and by an imaginative pleading or an imaginative party, a federal cause of action is filed and then the party attempts to apply for the pendent jurisdiction over the state law claim which should not be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.733" offset="11390244">We would ask that that this Court determine that there is no power as the Ninth Circuit has said to entertain under pendant jurisdiction especially additional parties that if there is power and if there is discretion and for the Court to hear or not to hear on the basis of that power what kind of a rule will there be, that will be established throughout the country upon which all lawyers and Courts can base some consideration in a determination of the application of pendent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.987" offset="11527230">If it is to be based upon the discretion will it not have to be on a case by case basis and if the discretion is exercised on a case by case application then how is there any rule to which one can refer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.707" offset="11586163">The other difficulty is that if we are attempting to save judicial time and energy in adopting the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, how will there be a saving of judicial time and energy if the Court has to determine on a case by case basis in the federal system whether or not the application of pendent jurisdiction and that doctrine is appropriate in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.357" offset="11688772">And will it not require a review by this Court on a case by case basis as to the exercise of that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.670" offset="11725970">If the fairness is what is to be considered then is there a fairness to the defendant who has a right to be sued in the State Court on the basis of the state law claim and have that state law claim determined by the State Court if the action can be joined on the basis of pendent jurisdiction even though he was not a proper party to the federal question filed in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.311" offset="12148527">Well, your Honor I would say, I would submit this that that is the proper application of the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction as opposed to what should be distinguished in considering that jurisdiction from pendent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.367" offset="12204742">That is the proper doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction in which the defendant has chosen to remove and the defendant who is in the Court then asks that there be a jurisdiction by appropriate joinder even though of another party who he feels is liable rather than himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.998" offset="12283319">The Twentieth United States code 1338 (b) which appears to be argued as an extension by Congress of pendent jurisdiction over patent and copyright cases, the county would allege in this case has been the only extension of that doctrine by Congressional Authority and that the other extension of pendent jurisdiction has been a Court created doctrine which this Court should carefully consider and recede from so that cases will be appropriately filed in the State Courts, the determinations will be made under state law in then if there is some difficulty with federal question or federal constitutional application, it will come in to the Federal Courts only upon that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3103.658" offset="12517898">Yes sir, very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.817" offset="12526571">I too found the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion very curious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.604" offset="12545692">On the hand they affirmed that there was no power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.329" offset="12556664">On the other hand he did what he did not allow the District Court to do, analyze on a case by case basis whether it was appropriate to join the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.057" offset="12591563">He said that this case was not an appropriate one to join, that is his view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.600" offset="12609745">Implicitly that states that there are cases that are appropriate to join and that is the value of pendant jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.396" offset="12640883">The reason for pendent jurisdiction has had woven through it, the underlying rationale of judicial of economy and it is only the District Court that has the case before it that can decide with any effectiveness at all, whether it is appropriate to join all the claims and hear them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.706" offset="12718101">An inflexible rule will be unworkable, will cause distress and will not promote judicial economy but will cause duplication of law suit.</text>
