            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73780">In 74-1560 United States against Martinez and 75-5387 Sifuentes against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.295" offset="130936">Again, we have two cases that present the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.131" offset="158208">The problem here arises from aliens to enter the United States illegally, primarily from Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.118" offset="190182">The border with Mexico is almost 2000 miles long.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.982" offset="205646">There are several million aliens illegally in the country most of whom crossed the Mexican border surreptitiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.052" offset="237933">They have void lawful ports of entry, cross on foot at various points and rendezvous smugglers to transport them inland.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.750" offset="276699">The border patrol conducts three kinds of inland traffic checking operations, roving patrols, temporary checkpoints and permanently located checkpoints.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.248" offset="330720">We are concerned today with the operation of two permanent checkpoints, one located on a principal highway in California and the other on important highway in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.234" offset="378681">The defendants in these cases were stopped for questioning and aliens were found in  both vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.077" offset="410028">The issue presented is whether the Fourth Amendment prohibition against searches and seizures was violated by routine checkpoint stops of vehicles on a public highway for the questioning of occupants.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.690" offset="464467">These stops are made where there is neither probable cause nor any reasonable suspicion in a legal sense for leaving the vehicles contain illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.132" offset="514204">At the San Clemente checkpoint involved in one of these cases during an eight day period in 1974, 146,000 vehicles passed the checkpoint, all were slowed to a few miles per hour to allow for a fleeting visual inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.535" offset="599886">820 vehicles were selected and referred to a secondary area for routine questioning as to citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.210" offset="638547">Of the 820 vehicles so selected, 171 were found to be transporting a total of 725 deportable aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.694" offset="692464">The questioning that occurs usually takes no more than three to five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.032" offset="717855">The stopping of motorist on highways for various inquiries, license checks, weight limit inspections, fruit and vegetable inspections and alike is familiar to all motorists.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.912" offset="773339">We hold that stops for brief questioning routinely conducted at an official checkpoint wholly consistent with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.837" offset="813045">The intrusion on privacy and the limitation on freedom of movement in these situations are minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.835" offset="845019">The public interest and the need for this widest law enforcement technique on the other hand have been demonstrated abundantly by the records in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.854" offset="889114">Accordingly we reverse number 74-1560, here from the Court of Appeal from the Ninth Circuit and we affirm 75-5387 here from the Court of Appeals from the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.721" offset="952644">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall has concurred.</text>
