            <text syncTime="2314.009" offset="9359381">In this case, I would like to stress at the very beginning that throughout the appellate process in the case, Time Inc. has never ever argued until today that it is entitled to any trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.471" offset="9425209">The briefs that have been filed throughout the Appellate Courts in Florida and the briefs that are filed here today solely urge that they are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.290" offset="9464497">Now, that does not mean to say that I do not think the Court has the power to decide that any trial should be granted, but that question has never been argued by Time and has never been briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.942" offset="9523116">Starting with point one on appeal, that is their argument that they truthfully reported a judicial decision and that this was an accurate reflection of what the divorce decree stated and we would simply point out to the Court that while the husband in this case counterclaimed for divorce on the grounds of adultery and mental cruelty, the divorce decree solely stated that the husband’s counterclaim for divorce was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.699" offset="9638055">Now, they are argue that that allows them to assume that it was granted on all grounds and I think we all know that the only thing it allows us to assume is that the judge found in favor of the husband on one of the grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2443.595" offset="9877650">I think that any way in regard to this, in regard to whether the article adequately stated what was in the divorce decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.346" offset="9924670">In this case, the jury was instructed, there can be no recovery in this case if you find from the greater way of the evidence that the article as published had no different effect on the mind of the reader than the divorce judgment and/or that the article was substantially true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.036" offset="9995410">And of course, the jury found in favor of Mrs. Firestone, and therefore, they found that the article did have a different effect on the mind of the reader than the divorce decree and if anything, we would submit that this was a question for the jury and the jury found against the decision that my opponent is urging here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.257" offset="10092377">Time Inc. argues that there was no, absolutely no evidence of negligence in this case on their part as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.537" offset="10133441">And we would submit to the Court that it is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.628" offset="10145771">They first argued that, of course, their interpretation was correct and we submit that it was not, they argued that their editorial procedure was without fault, that there was no negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.448" offset="10201150">In this case, we know that Time had received three documents, dispatches and articles and also a dispatch from Mr. Delaney who was their stringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.992" offset="10255276">The three articles and dispatches other than Delaney’s did in no way, we would submit, state that the divorce was granted on the grounds of adultery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.510" offset="10305327">Each of those articles or dispatches stated that Mrs. Firestone was accused of adultery or her husband had counterclaimed for adultery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.045" offset="10347541">They did receive the dispatch from their stringer and he stated that he had checked with her attorney and that the technical grounds for divorce were mental cruelty and adultery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.685" offset="10394039">However, we would submit to the Court that the evidence shows that even then, regardless of the dispatch from Delaney that there were serious doubts in Time Inc.’s mind as to whether or not this was an accurate statement because there was testimony to the effect that a Ms. Nadasdy (ph), who was a legal researcher for Time was supposed to, after the article was written, take the article, and run what they call an accuracy check on the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.741" offset="10538234">And she was to make a determination that each and every word was accurate and it was supportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.819" offset="10566551">She did not mark the word adultery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.913" offset="10578985">She marked the other words in the article, I think with the exception of a few, that she did not mark the word adultery.</text>

            <text syncTime="2642.303" offset="10672504">Now, we think that this testimony clearly indicates that there was a serious doubt in her mind as to whether or not they had sufficient information to support that or whether or not it has sufficient sources to support the publication that Mrs. Firestone had been found guilty of adultery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.050" offset="10755469">However, of course, we know that Time went ahead and released this publication stating that she had been found guilty of adultery and we would submit to the Court because the divorce decree was rendered on a Friday night about 5:00 and their deadline for publication was Saturday night at about 8:00, so they were pressed for time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.458" offset="10845121">We think that that clearly indicates if not only negligence but a reckless disregard on the part of Time Inc. for going ahead in publishing the article when the employees did not even follow the requirement which they admitted, that Time Inc. imposed upon them to follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="2778.299" offset="11216478">Their point too is the argument that this was a rational interpretation of an ambiguous document and of course, as you know, the first argument in my brief is that the Pape case is not even applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.680" offset="11270081">And perhaps for some of the comments here, I might see that you do think that it is applicable, but I think that the Pape decisions says that when have an ambiguous document, and the publisher reads that document and relies upon a rational interpretation of the language in that document, then there is no malice as a matter for law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.862" offset="11366734">Now, that does not mean that I think that everybody has to go and read the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.725" offset="11390244">That I think that if someone does not read the document and there is rational interpretation that they have to be held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.308" offset="11416576">I am just saying that the Pape case does apply and I think you are talking about perhaps common law, qualified privilege outside the Pape case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.124" offset="11451789">However, if we apply Pape to this situation, I think clearly that it does not become a question as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.079" offset="11487629">I think clearly that it would be a question for a jury to decide and in this case, Time Inc. never asked for the jury to be instructed, that if you find that the article was a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous document then there is no malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.083" offset="11587625">The only instruction they asked for was an instruction to the effect that you are instructed that a reasonable interpretation on that divorce decree is that adultery was one of the grounds for the divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.449" offset="11649065">So we would submit to the Court that they have not properly in the Trial Court -- they have not sufficiently laid the ground work to raise this point on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.195" offset="11692115">And then we come to the actual malice standard and they have two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.974" offset="11711237">Number one: that Rosenbloom and Cox Broadcasting have extended the New York Times document to report to judicial proceedings and we would first say that we really do not read those cases is doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.931" offset="11779051">I think the Cox Broadcasting case says essentially that truth is the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.727" offset="11798172">That if you truthfully report a judicial proceeding or judicial report then it is a defense and I think that we have shown in this case that their publication was not truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.143" offset="11851880">The second question and perhaps one of the most relevant here is whether or not Mrs. Firestone was a public figure, and therefore, whether or not the standard of actual malice was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.188" offset="11904021">Of course how you to determine this, and we are going to have to look to the various decisions of this Court, to the language in those decisions and I think perhaps the one that comes most to mind is Gertz because there, I think it was talked about perhaps one of the other decisions and some of the language is a public figure is one who has voluntarily placed himself in the public spotlight by reason of notoriety of their achievements or the vigor and success for which they seek the public’s attention, that they become labeled as public figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.595" offset="12037663">They thrust themselves to the forefront of public controversies in order to influence the resolution of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.682" offset="12066084">They invite attention and comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.391" offset="12080922">They voluntarily expose themselves to the increased risk of injury from defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.556" offset="12109552">I think that is generally the language in Gertz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.471" offset="12121150">In this case, I would like to point out that although Mrs. Firestone did file a complaint in this case for separate maintenance, unconnected with divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.272" offset="12172350">She did not file for divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.482" offset="12181232">Her husband, of course, counterclaimed against her for divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.211" offset="12200145">She did not institute the divorce proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.511" offset="12213310">Therefore, it would be our contention that she was involuntarily drawn into divorce proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.380" offset="12252808">We can only say that simply because the newspapers chose to write about Mrs. Firestone and to write about her divorce does not make her a public figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.063" offset="12311531">She was married to a wealthy man and we certainly admit that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3833.521" offset="15437343">The pencil-check appeared on above each the keywords in the article, the pencil-check of the researcher, except the word adultery and do you suppose that testimony was overlooked by the jury?</text>

            <text syncTime="4049.458" offset="16301160">The claim for damage to reputation was withdrawn because it was quite clear, we were prepared -- Time was prepared to do in proving this and the danger that follows from allowing claim for a representation to be withdrawn is clear from the record in this case because Mrs. Firestone testified the thing that concerned her most about this article was that someday, as counsel for the respondent has said, someday her infant son would hear about and understand what it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.564" offset="16449536">That appears in the record 393 and the jury sent back a query, in the record on page 515 to the judge asking if they could award compensatory damages to the son in trust for him.</text>
