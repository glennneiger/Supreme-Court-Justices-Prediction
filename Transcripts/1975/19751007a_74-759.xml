            <label>Mr. Paul L. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="46.044" offset="287471">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.079" offset="299592">This case is here in a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.591" offset="329685">The question is whether a physician, and it also applies to other practitioners including pharmacist, registered under the Controlled Substances Act to prescribe and dispense drugs for legitimate medical purposes is immune merely because he is so registered from prosecution under the Section of the Act which prohibits the unlawful distribution of controlled substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.311" offset="440549">The evidence at trial was overwhelming that respondent was really no different from any street-corner drug pusher and that he engaged in the indiscriminant sale of prescriptions for profit without really providing any type of medical treatment for his so-called patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.646" offset="505855">And yet the Court of Appeals concluded that Congress intended to exempt someone like respondent because he was a doctor from penalties applicable to other traffickers in narcotic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.194" offset="552039">In reaching this conclusion, the District of Columbia Circuit stands alone, because of this, the First Circuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Ninth Circuit and the Tenth Circuit, and we think by implication the Sixth Circuit had concluded that Congress intended that doctors, pharmacies, hospitals, veterinarians and other practitioners, who after all had the greatest access to drugs and the greatest opportunity to divert them, would be treated the same as any other persons when they traffic in narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.588" offset="673665">Briefly, the facts, are that respondent was indicted at first in 639 counts, each involving a sale of a prescription, but he went to trial on 40 counts, 38 were presented to the jury and they have convicted in 22 counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.171" offset="747958">The evidence at trial showed that methadone, which is the controlled substance involved in this case, is a synthetic narcotic drug, it is a morphine substitute and it can be as physically and psychologically addictive as heroin can.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.429" offset="825071">In fact because it is cheaper and it is often more readily available than heroin, some heroin addicts use it as a substitute for heroin when they cannot get heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.844" offset="858717">But at the same time, under proper supervision and control, it can be very useful in the treatment of addicts either through “detoxification” or “maintenance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="200.535" offset="905424">Detoxification, which is what respondent say he was involved in here, involves giving the addict a large of dose of methadone at first in order to keep him free from withdrawal symptoms and gradually reducing the dosage until he obtains -- attains abstinence from all drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.702" offset="974073">Maintenance on the other hand, really substitutes methadone addiction for heroin addiction, a fixed dosage is given for an indefinite period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.484" offset="1017228">Now, respondent had run a detoxification program in the District of Columbia in 1969, but he was ultimately arrested for violating the Harrison Narcotics Act, an Act that this Court said maybe violated by physicians when they sell prescriptions or drugs indiscriminately and not for legitimate medical purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.380" offset="1112836">He promised at that time that an exchange for the dismissal of charges, he promised the Grand Jury that he would change his ways in the manner in which he conducted his program.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.238" offset="1148258">That he would obtain medical histories from all of his patients, that he would conduct reasonably thorough physical examinations, that he would abide by the results of urinalysis, which can show whether or not there are narcotics in the bloodstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.426" offset="1201025">That he would record the times and the amounts of the dosages of methadone given and that he would either give the methadone at his clinic or he would prescribe only so much as necessary for daily dosage.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.827" offset="1246583">At trial in this case, he admitted that he did not follow these agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.668" offset="1273959">In a five and one-half month period, which is the time involved in the indictment here, from September 1, 1971 to February 11, 1972, it is true that respondent was registered under the Controlled Substances Act to conduct the methadone detoxification program.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.810" offset="1342504">He did not give physical examinations to his so-called patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.641" offset="1357864">He did not take urine samples under supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.794" offset="1370508">He ignored the results of his urine samples and he did not give the methadone at his clinic and he did not prescribe only a daily dosage.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.816" offset="1414602">Rather, he sold prescriptions and he charged as our brief indicates and as the record clearly shows, depending upon the amount of tablets prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.379" offset="1460787">If you got a 50-tablet prescription you pay $15.00, if you got a 75-tablet prescription you would pay $25.00, for a 100-tablet prescription you pay $35.00, you could come back as often as you wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.249" offset="1508330">Some of witnesses testified they came back every day or every other day, a few came back on occasion, more than once in a single day.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.279" offset="1544379">No, what did was he wrote out the prescription for whatever amounts you want it and you paid for the prescription, you then went to a drug store and had the prescription filled and paid again for the druggist's fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.317" offset="1600594">There were three particular drugstores involved here, none of which were charged with any criminal offenses, but the 11,000 prescriptions filled in this period were all filled at these particular drugstores.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.153" offset="1699964">It was the cost of him writing a hundred rather than fifty that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.007" offset="1727340">In five-and-half months, he sold prescriptions for 800,000 Dolophine tablets, which is a form of methadone and he took in over a quarter of a million dollars.</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_l_friedman" startTime="429.736" stopTime="493.380">
            <label>Mr. Paul L. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="429.736" offset="1822217">The appearance before the Grand Jury was back in ’69 when he promised to make the change in his form of treatment and for a time he apparently did or at least was not detected, if he did not and he did have a registration to engage in detoxification.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.683" offset="1882090">But then in ’71 it came to the attention of the authorities that he was not following these promises and through the use of undercover agents and otherwise, they found that he was not doing any of the things that he promised that he would do and so he was arrested, closed down and indicted in these 639 counts indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.367" offset="1976758">There was some feeling I gather that back in ’69 that because detoxification could be useful if properly run and supervised and controlled, that Dr. Moore should be given a chance to do it under proper conditions because he could make a contribution to the community in helping addicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.189" offset="2044049">But apparently as the evidence showed at trial that was not his desire or intention at all, because less than two-years later he was --</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul L. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="503.051" offset="2115520">Well I think it is important to put this in a proper factual context and to show really how Congress could not possibly have intended, that people that engage in this kind of a egregious conduct should be exempt from felony prosecution for distributing or selling narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.183" offset="2188036">Congress was well aware of the potential for abuse, the dangers that treatment programs have, the fact that doctors are the largest source, doctors and pharmacies, of diversion of drugs into illicit channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.639" offset="2241848">And they could not possibly, in light of the opinions of this Court, have intended without ever saying so to have exempted physicians because the law was clear at the time they enacted the Controlled Substances Act that physicians were covered by the old Harrison Narcotic Act, and we do not think that given what Congress knew, they by their silence intended to exempt the physicians.</text>

            <text syncTime="558.905" offset="2338919">Well, I gather in the Court of Appeals, the conclusion was, admitting all this things that you have say that Doctor did, that the, nevertheless he could not be prosecuted for violation of this statue, but if for any, it would have to be for non-compliance with the provisions governing his registration under 822, is it not that it?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="584.141" offset="2439856">I mean is that essentially what the Court --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_l_friedman" startTime="585.372" stopTime="795.188">
            <label>Mr. Paul L. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="585.372" offset="2444767">Essentially, what the Court of Appeals said is that, that he could only be prosecuted under 842 or possibly 843 if he did things like -- they were covered by that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.671" offset="2505998">842 (a) (1) is what the Court of Appeals particularly referred to which is a statute which prescribes someone, which makes it originally a civil penalty unless you do it knowingly, to distribute or dispense a controlled substance without the prescription of 829.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.954" offset="2603174">Now, Judge McKinnon (ph) in his dissent said that if you are not prescribing for legitimate medical purpose then it is not really a prescription, and therefore, you could be punished under 842 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="641.096" offset="2667644">We are not so sure that it is not the prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.458" offset="2681123">It still looks like a prescription and a pharmacist sees it, he relies upon it and he prescribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.464" offset="2705156">But perhaps more importantly than that, the legislative history in the whole statutory scheme makes clear that 842, and to some extent 843, really intends to get at the kinds of technical violations of a registration scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.157" offset="2759909">And the anomaly is that if he writes a prescription, as Dr. Moore did, he may be punishable under 842 (a) (1), but if he gives away drugs indiscriminately, the analogy or the contrast that Judge Lombard used in the Rosenberg case in the Ninth Circuit was, if he stands in a street corner giving out drugs or giving out prescriptions, he cannot be prosecuted at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.165" offset="2851964">But if he writes it in a piece of paper, which may or may not be for a legitimate medical purpose, he can be punished up to one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.151" offset="2879863">Now, that does not make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.388" offset="2884878">If he is really selling drugs, and by selling prescriptions he is selling drugs, he ought to be treated like any other trafficker like any narcotics pusher because he is really no better than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.261" offset="2936392">And we think that Congress intended that.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.361" offset="2948722">Now, very briefly, the way we read the statute and we think the more logical way to read the statute, is not to say that when 21 U.S.C. 841 (a) (1) says, except as authorized by this subject, they intend to wholly exempt a whole class of people, but they are talking about his conduct that maybe authorized by the subchapter because they say that it shall be unlawful for any person to distribute or dispense a controlled substance, except as authorized by the subchapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.468" offset="3081215">Now, the kind of conduct involved is then defined by other provisions of the subchapter, beginning with Section (a) (22) which requires a registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.293" offset="3128444">But the registration does not authorize a person so registered to do anything he wants to with the controlled substance, but rather he is permitted to dispense or distribute only to the extent authorized by his registration and in conformity with other provisions of the subchapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.665" offset="3193959">Now, the registration, which Dr. Moore had permitted him to dispense for detoxification, the evidence at trial showed that that is not what he was doing, he was not dispensing for any legitimate form of medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.128" offset="3251847">But we do not rely solely on that, we rely on the -- in conformity with other provisions of this subchapter language, and the other provisions of the sub --</text>

            <text syncTime="858.421" offset="3536999">In other words Mr. Bergan argues that, that one of the problems in this case is that respondent was convicted of violating a regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.546" offset="3577541">He was convicted of violating a statute, which by its terms explain what was authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.614" offset="3597812">Prosecutor used the regulation before the Court to explain more fully, what the statute meant to the extent that he referred to 306.04 (c) which referred to methadone maintenance; that described what Dr. Moore’s particular registration permitted him to do and not to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.823" offset="3686629">He was permitted to detoxify, not to maintain, but I am pointing a fact, the theory of trial, was that he did not engage in any bona fide medical practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.994" offset="3727275">The expert said he did not engage in practice which was acceptable either for detoxification or maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.649" offset="3749949">The lay testimony made clear to anybody listening to it that this was not legitimate medical practice for any purpose, and that we say is what the jury found, and that is a violation 841.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.178" offset="3904072">He said at trial, and it is in appendix of page 113, that it was never his intention to maintain patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.414" offset="3933016">My intent was to detoxify patients and to get them completely off of all drugs.</text>

            <text syncTime="964.596" offset="3961646">I want them to make them completely drug-free and so to the extent that we relied on the regulation, there was no inconsistency, no prejudice to respondent, and yet his testimony of trial was, what he did was he gave them as much as they wanted to go out, fill themselves up with methadone, and a new theory of blockading and then they would come back to him and say I am ready now to detoxify, that is the second stage, I cannot take anymore methadone, I cannot take anymore heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.062" offset="4079510">But when asked about the second stage, which would obviously be the crucial stage in that kind of so-called “treatment” psychological counseling, there was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.189" offset="4128098">A typical visit lasted from 30 to 60 seconds, on one day he prescribed he wrote 271 prescriptions, and he was asked how he could do that in a single day, how he could, counsel he said, I either write very fast or I talk very fast and possibly both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.316" offset="4180552">That is the kind of practice that was involved here and the statue we think by its terms, by its definition of dispensing limited to a practitioner, by its definition of practitioner, which allows dispensing solely in the course of professional practice which means for a legitimate medical purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.740" offset="4262263">Congress intended that this kind of drug trafficker should be covered by the felony provision, which makes it unlawful to distribute or to sell.</text>

            <text syncTime="1142.965" offset="4675207">Well, except that Congress when it wrote the Controlled Substances Act was aware of that very kind of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.536" offset="4697463">There is some language in legislative history that originally appeared on the Prettyman Commission report said that one of the problems with the Harrison Act was that we are allowing federal prosecutors to make judgments as to what is a legitimate medical practice and what ought not to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.507" offset="4753365">And so with the Controlled Substances Act, what Congress said in writing the Controlled Substances Act is we agree that ought not to be, but on the other hand drug abuse is too significant a problem to allow this kind of experimentation by just any physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.174" offset="4811984">So what we are going to do is we are going to have a provision in the statute, which allows the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare rather than the Attorney General to set out what kinds of things can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.132" offset="4851794">If you want to try a new form of treatment -- a new form of treatment that you want to experiment with, well, go to the Secretary of H.E.W and he will give you a special registration to do it under the statute and he will run it by the Attorney General, but he will make the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.854" offset="4918772">Now, we do not like the idea, said Congress, of having any official in the Federal Government defining what is and is not permissible, but better it should be the Secretary of H.E.W than the Attorney General, but it has to be somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.211" offset="4980108">It cannot be left to the individual practitioner because the potential for abuse is simply too great and so in 21 U.S.C. 823 (f), there were provision made -- there was provision made for new kinds of research.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.908" offset="5034965">If you went to the Secretary of H.E.W and said, I want to try this kind of method instead and in the new Act, the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974, Congress took it upon itself to put some specifics into the law by saying that you could never prescribe for detoxification or maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.491" offset="5121273">The implication of the regulation, which was passed after the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974, is that it can only be given out in clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.076" offset="5155651">It cannot be prescribed to go to pharmacist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.522" offset="5173414">So the Public Health Agency was given the authority under the Controlled Substances Act to set standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.824" offset="5202567">If one complies with those standards he obviously cannot be prosecuted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.310" offset="5340598">It recognized that doctors, pharmacies are the greatest sources of the illegitimate distribution of narcotics, It is amply supported in the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.540" offset="5381453">Does Congress set out what can and cannot be done?</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.557" offset="5393574">Congress said in the course of professional practice for a legitimate medical purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.842" offset="5414681">These are terms which this Court had no trouble with under the Harrison Act, and on the evidence of this case and in fact, if you compare the facts of some of the early Harrison cases, Jin Fuey Moy and Webb (ph), as opposed to Linder which was the latter case in which -- what was involved was four morphine tablets, we think that under a definition of good faith effort to treat, legitimate medical purpose in the course of professional practice, judges and juries can make those kinds of judgments and evidence before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.404" offset="5548950">And that the facts of this case are so blatant, so blatant that no one could honestly believe that this man was engaged in legitimate medical practice in the course of his professional practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.345" offset="5612689">And the fact that Congress has set up a mechanism to define what can and cannot be done, and there are ways to find out what you can and cannot do helps to solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.043" offset="5659500">Now, to the extent that it does not -- it may not permit every single kind of experimentation in a clinic program as opposed to in a laboratory or on an experimental basis, we think it is legitimate for Congress to have made that judgment because of the tremendous potential for abuse and danger and because of what we see in this case, of the addicts, the methadone addicts who came into court and testified as to what Dr. Moore did to them, and how much more soft they were after they went into his program than when they started in his program.</text>

            <text syncTime="1480.137" offset="6023856">That the technical provisions of the statue are really not enough and the anomaly of relying solely on the technical provisions, as opposed to the provision for a drug trafficker, makes clear that Congress really intended that as does the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.625" offset="6229806">They intended to give the drug pusher, the drug trafficker, no matter who he was and the statutory language, the scheme, and the legislative history all support that.</text>
