            <text syncTime="12.252" offset="122685">This case is here from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and it arose when the respondent union called a strike in support of certain sister unions involved in negotiations with the same employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.362" offset="203037">The employer claims that the strike was in violation of the no-strike clause contained in the contract between the company and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.894" offset="237206">On the other hand, the union said that sympathy strikes werenâ€™t reached by the no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.629" offset="264164">The contract also contained arbitration provision, admittedly reaching the issue whether a sympathy strike did violate the promise of the union, not to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.739" offset="328634">The issue in the case is whether a federal court may issue an injunction against a strike, pending the decision of the arbitrator as to whether the union has breached it's promise not to strike by calling a sympathy strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.143" offset="398224">Court of Appeals said that federal court had no such power and we agree with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.552" offset="423824">For the reasons that we have stated in the opinion on file with the clerk, we hold that the Norris-Laguardia Act debars the issue of some injunction, pending arbitration of the issue that I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.596" offset="487981">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.886" offset="501147">He is joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall and Powell.</text>
