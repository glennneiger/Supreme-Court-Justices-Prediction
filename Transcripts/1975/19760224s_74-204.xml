            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="10.057" offset="113926">This case is here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.231" offset="134720">It presents a question of what process is due when disability benefits are terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.801" offset="160946">Under the Social Security Act, a worker, receiving such benefits, has a burden of showing continuous disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.062" offset="198040">When disability is put in issue, as it was with respect to respondent, regulations of the secretary of HEW prescribed an elaborate administrative review procedure, but this procedure does not include an oral evidentiary hearing prior to termination of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.683" offset="288529">Respondent, in this case, challenged the validity of the procedure by suit in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.353" offset="319144">That court, relying on this Courtâ€™s decision in Goldberg against Kelly, held that such a hearing was constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.171" offset="358432">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.106" offset="370135">The decision whether to discontinue disability benefits normally turns upon documented medical evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.944" offset="405557">The issue of disability is a focused and limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.518" offset="427813">Prior to termination of benefits, the claimant is given access to government trials and to the reasons for the tentative decision to discontinue.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.310" offset="474938">The claimant also is afforded an opportunity to submit additional evidence and arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.963" offset="505554">Following discontinuance of benefits, there is a right to an oral evidentiary hearing and ultimately to judicial review before the denial becomes final.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.703" offset="556545">In view of the nature of the inquiry and a carefully structured system for administrative review, we find no deprivation of procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.419" offset="603461">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.040" offset="621955">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.299" offset="646929">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
