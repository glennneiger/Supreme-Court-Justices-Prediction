            <label>Mr. Henry M. Rosenblum</label>
            <text syncTime="56.096" offset="327716">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.870" offset="342762">The petitioners here seek and have sought redress under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and under Section 1981 of 42 United States Code, the codification of the Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, for private racial discrimination in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.839" offset="438684">In all substantial respects there is no particular difference in this case than in the legion numbers of cases that is presently pending in the Federal District Courts around the country except that in this case the petitioners who seek to redress the grievance of private discrimination based on race in their employment are white.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.663" offset="525933">Basically, the two petitioners, Mr. McDonald and Mr. Laird were accused by their employer Santa Fe of misappropriating company property.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.175" offset="575983">Along with them stood accused a black co-worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.924" offset="595000">As result of the accusations, the two petitioners were discharged, their black co-worker was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.721" offset="630214">Because disparate disciplinary treatment so often smacks of illegal motive in a racial context, the petitioners concluded that they have been discriminated against because of their race and accordingly instituted an action in the Federal District Court in the State -- Southern District of Texas, alleging that the race was a factor in their discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.211" offset="736166">More clearly stated, the petitioners concluded and urge that, but for the immutable characteristic of the color of their skin that they would have received the favored treatment accorded to their black co-worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.412" offset="793009">In many respects this is no different than a fact situation recently before the Court in Franks versus Bowman where it would be one way of describing the circumstances in that case would be to say that the black employees had been excluded from the over the road driving classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.206" offset="892169">Another way would have been to say that the white employees of Bowman Transportation were accorded the preference and this is precisely and only what these petitioners have alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.582" offset="945668">The District Court dismissed the cause of action, stating that a white employee charged with misappropriating company property and dismissed cannot complain of racial discrimination where a similarly charged black employee is not dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.314" offset="1008571">It also dismissed, stating that Section 1981 confers no actionable rights upon a white person.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.150" offset="1035947">The Fifth Circuit affirmed, adopting an apparent finding of the District Court that the petitioners had failed to deny the allegations of the complaint of the misappropriation on their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.666" offset="1093939">None of the respondents -- neither of the respondents and none of the amicus have seriously disputed that Title VII embraces by its language, discrimination against white persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.392" offset="1148901">This is supported by all of the many of the EEOC decisions which are entitled the great deference as the body charged with the administration of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.881" offset="1202818">It is supported by the language in Griggs v. Duke Power Company wherein the Court stated that preferences, whether for majority or minority are all the Congress intended to prescribe and it is supported by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.251" offset="1272303">Assuming then that Title VII may be invoked by white persons, we turn to the question of whether these petitioners have stated the claim under which relief can be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.638" offset="1317861">For the purposes of this consideration, it is not necessary that the Court consider the color of the petitioner’s skin, but only whether racial motivation was a factor or race was a factor in the framework of Section 703 (a) (1) in their discharge or in the discipline accorded them.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.793" offset="1410543">That of course is the gravamen of any Title VII or Section 1981 employment discrimination complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.329" offset="1436666">This complaint could not even -- could not conceivably or even arguably have been made -- had been lodged, could it, if all three employees had been of the same race and then two were discharged?</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry M. Rosenblum</label>
            <text syncTime="354.459" offset="1521198">I have thought about a lot and I do not believe that it could have been, no sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.836" offset="1546694">We do not -- it is important that we point out, we do not urge that any employer is without the right to discipline within his discretion, those who commit unlawful acts and those who commit wrongdoings within the employment of their employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.327" offset="1620672">However, what we do urge is that when an employer discharges employees for such wrongdoings that the criteria for such discharges must be evenly applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.344" offset="1676679">That is not to say that you cannot discipline a black person differently than a white person.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.418" offset="1696950">It is to say that the reason for the different discipline cannot be founded or even touched by a racial factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.847" offset="1734671">There maybe no racial motivation between the difference in discipline accorded to the different races.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.349" offset="1768734">In any event the petitioners did allege that the difference in discipline accorded them was because of their race and we are told in McDonnell Douglas versus Green as well as other cases that an injured party, black or white will make such an allegation has stated the claim under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.030" offset="1843445">The fact that the petitioners are accused of a theft should be no impediment to such a holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.714" offset="1874165">Clearly there was no impediment in the McDonnell Douglas v. Green case where the -- was the respondent in that case Mr. Green was a convicted misdemeanant and here all we have is mere allegations of a wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.446" offset="1953159">The Fifth Circuit seem to bottom its affirmation on the fact that the District Court had observed that the petitioners had not denied in their complaint that they were guilty of misappropriation as alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.545" offset="2013554">It appears to me to be a fundamental error in the proposition that the Fifth Circuit bottomed its decision on and that is for one the petition on its face says that the petitioners were discharged without cause, and therefore, whatever reasons were ascribed, even though they suggest they were protectoral reasons, but whatever the reason that had been advanced is denied by the pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.302" offset="2144584">Secondly, in assuming arguendo that they had failed to deny the truth of the allegation or the reason advanced for the discharge on their complaint, it really would make no difference at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.902" offset="2198919">The petitioners alleged and the District Court considered in dismissing, pursuant to Rule 12 (b) (6) that the three parties, that is the two petitioners and Mr. Jackson, their black co-worker were equally charged and equally culpable when it dismissed the decision, the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.348" offset="2292751">The Court has again reiterated in a recent decision, treating and touching on this case that given the same opportunity, it would hold the same way that the failure to deny the allegations of misappropriation take a complainant, black or white, out of the embrace of Title VII and we submit that is simply wrong.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Stanley Pottinger</label>
            <text syncTime="1231.787" offset="5030488">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.976" offset="5043236">In the view of the United States the central issue in the case is both basic and uncomplicated and that is should a person, any person who alleges that he or she has been a victim of racial discrimination in employment have an opportunity to have those allegations be heard and tested in the atmosphere of an evidentiary hearing and we think the answer to this question is yes, both as to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.143" offset="5175938">It seems to us that the Courts below have misunderstood, particularly in light of the question raced by Mr. Justice Powell --Mr. Justice Stewart, that the allegation, the mere facial allegation of some form of wrongdoing in this case, theft could supersede an allegation of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.574" offset="5273636">Simply put, we believe that McDonnell Douglas and the Griggs decision make clear that that particular allegation must be tested beyond the phase of the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.192" offset="5316058">That to rely upon it outside the pleadings and indeed there was no summary judgment motion in this case is a mistake because it assumes a burden that should be shifted at least in some evidentiary fashion to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.018" offset="5387425">In the McDonnell case, McDonnell Douglas case, the Court set a four-prong test in that case stating that if a person made out a prima facie case of racial discrimination by being a member of a minority group, by having been qualified for the job, but rejected and by having others accepted for the position, the burden did shift and in some evidentiary fashion those allegations would have to be tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.692" offset="5494109">We believe that the same essential ingredients are in this case, even though the complainants were white because in this particular case they have met the burden of the first test of McDonnell Douglas by indicating that not only was racial discrimination practiced, but that three people, two of which were white one of which is black similarly situated were indeed of equal culpability on the face of the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.374" offset="5596823">Now, we would concur with the implication of Justice Marshall’s question that should upon an evidentiary hearing, facts be developed that would indicate a greater culpability or a different culpability on the part of the white complainants as opposed to the black that those factors, assuming they were not racial in nature, ought to be able to be controlling factors, we do not disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.109" offset="5691804">But on the course of the pleadings, on the face of the pleadings, those allegations simply do not appear and to dismiss the case entirely simply because of an alleged lack of standing and we believe makes a gross error and is a basic misconstruction of Griggs and McDonnell Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.675" offset="5778008">With regard to the 1981 claim, it is our view that the Thirteenth Amendment in answer to the questions presented here is an inadequate basis for the statute and that the reenactment of the statute subsequent to the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment does impart a sense of equal protection concept and which is not a racially preferential concept into the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.913" offset="5894932">The Thirteenth Amendment on the face of it is not a racially preferential statute as Senator Trumbull said when, who is one of the authors of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.432" offset="5937041">The statute was passed to protect those who needed the benefits of it and clearly in 1866, that was the black race and to protect freedmen after that through the passage of the 1866 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.287" offset="5996496">But never on the face of the statute nor in the legislative history surrounding its passage did the debate supposed that it was only for black persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.492" offset="6033276">Indeed there is a great deal of legislative history that made clear that in eliminating all badges of slavery and in insuring no involuntary servitude, there were effects of the institution of slavery that might spill over to adversely affect whites and thereby protect them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.328" offset="6104643">In other words, the statement was made that all discrimination between blacks and whites should be eliminated and that was the purpose of the Thirteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.057" offset="6143513">This position was also adopted, I think to a lesser extent under the Fourteenth Amendment in 1897 case in which the Court stated that the implications of equal protection clause in Fourteenth Amendment had a gloss on the 1981 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.351" offset="6244764">We think in other words, that what has happened in this case is that the Court has misconstrued the nature of the allegation of theft at too early stage, at least before it could be clearly developed in evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.013" offset="6299412">In effect, what the Court has also done and this is partially known to as out of having the benefit of respondent's briefings is virtually to invite us to believe that racial discrimination did play a part in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.340" offset="6356672">For in the case, not only do the allegations make clear that the complainants in this case and Mr. Jackson, the black were equally culpable as a matter of allegation, but that in addition to that they were no other factors presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.370" offset="6416754">In addition to that, in the respondent's brief they acknowledged at page 4 that by definition it, in this case affirm of an action, involves at least some measure of preference for advantage for blacks and other racial minorities in connection with employment decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.526" offset="6481433">And they go on at least in a hypothetical fashion to suggest that as an abstract idea perhaps every employment or personnel decision should be colorblind, but this is a practical world and few parts of it are more practical than employment decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.853" offset="6534723">We submit that absolute racial equality under every conceivable circumstance would be counter productive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.140" offset="6559905">And finally at page 16 they invite us to assume racial discrimination may have played a factor further, by saying that assuming for the moment that the local manager had been influenced to some slight degree by Mr. Jackson’s race, perhaps thinking to himself “Jackson is black, all things considered will give him a break,” we cannot believe that we thus run afoul of the intent of Congress expressed in Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.217" offset="6660215">But to assume that those positions, if indeed they were developed upon an evidentiary hearing, to bear out those positions would indeed to be assume that the statement by the Court in Griggs was wrong in which the Court said that discriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and only what the Congress has proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.222" offset="6748196">So, our strong belief is that the case does not reach the questions of what constitutes affirmative action, especially since it compares individuals in this particular case, not groups or classes of protected persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.618" offset="6805769">But in that context an evidentiary hearing must be granted in order to develop those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.787" offset="6830429">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.603" offset="7101685">You will notice there that the petitioners allege that there was an investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.306" offset="9328571">Here referring to McDonnell Douglas against Green where they talk about the essentials of a cause of action in a case of this kind, the plaintiffs or the petitioners in this case to the -- when they alleged that they have been discharged for theft, they in a fact met the burden which might otherwise be placed upon us of coming back with our answer and saying they were just dismissed for theft and then the burden would shift back to them, even though we had answered the fact, answer to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.567" offset="9493560">They met our burden and then it was incumbent upon them to allege something more and that something might have been a pattern in practice, pretext, they at one point did allege pattern in practice, but they abandoned that when it became obvious that they could never make it stick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.148" offset="9591885">And you have heard some talk today about pretext?</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.247" offset="9608290">Well, that is an afterthought because they never alleged pretext in their complaint that the theft was a pretext, discharged them because of their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.563" offset="9649564">Also I want to emphasize that our action in this case grew out of an exercise of management’s discretion in discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.805" offset="9702540">A management must have considerable degree of discretion in administering discipline the same way Courts do in administering sentences in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.795" offset="9746530">What the petitioners would have this Court do is say that there must be a uniform sentence no matter what when you have got three people involved in the same transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.731" offset="9798253">I submit to you that that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.706" offset="9810165">That management has a right to be lenient, if it chooses and that it would not thereby run afoul of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.350" offset="9868679">I would like to touch very briefly on the 1981 point which the Court below held that whites are not entitled to claim that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.495" offset="9917267">And there it seems to me that the parties of not starting at the right point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.257" offset="9940359">I think you have to start with the Thirteenth Amendment and which of course was to -- the purpose of which to us to abolish slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.586" offset="9973691">And Section 1981 being part of The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was intended to implement that and if you read it, all persons shall enjoy the same rights are white citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.223" offset="10032205">If you read it to mean all white shall have the same rights as white citizens I submit that that is redundant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.726" offset="10058223">Now, there is legislative history of course on both sides and the courts are divided, but we believe that the best reading is one which would restrict 1981 relief to blacks and other minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.445" offset="10125097">If 1981 is read to confer or to require or to confer cause of action on whites then you are going to open the gates to suits such as the Sears, Roebuck case, Hollander v. Sears, Roebuck in which Sears set up a Summer Internship Program for the benefit of blacks, a young white man applied and was of course rejected, so he sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.187" offset="10244111">Now, that will have a very serious impact on the affirmative action programs which are the policy of the United States intended to assist the black men and other minorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.520" offset="10329374">If the Court please, both lower courts assumed that the two people -- the three people who were guilty of theft and he had gone into various allegations in pretrial hearings and it was before the District Court that the theft concerned 60 cases of anti-freeze then in transit in the possession of a common carrier, that is a crime under state law of felony and it is also a crime under Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.631" offset="10457897">Both courts held that if it is serious crime it is outside of the purview of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.797" offset="10490498">I would like to refer this Court to a line of cases by the lower courts that hold that the under National Labor Relations Act if serious theft on the job is involved, the entire case is outside of the purview even if the discharge was motivated by prohibited reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.784" offset="10586419">Please see NLRB vs. Magnuson, 523 Federal Second 643 which collates the decisions Seven Circuits to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.167" offset="10631977">I mention this point because in one if the briefs, that is the rejected brief, the point is made that you do the same thing under this statute that we do under the Labor Act because it was model for this statute, Title VII and I want the Court to please examine this line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.221" offset="10708254">The theory of the lower courts is that when you get down to the question of serious theft on the job, it does not effectuate the purposes of the statute and it also demeans the Court to reinstate and provide back pay for someone who is demonstrated to be guilty of that kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.355" offset="10796757">So here the Court must decide, I think whether in your judgment it is necessary to provide equality in punishment for serious theft on the job as a means of defective enforcement of Title VII or whether as was done under the Labor Act, you leave theft outside the purview of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.032" offset="10899471">Now, that is what this Court did in the ancient case of Fansteel which was cited in the McDonnell Douglas versus Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.947" offset="10931131">In Fansteel, the sit-down strikers were not reinstated, even though mini sit-down strikers were reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.945" offset="10971151">The Supreme Court said that kind of conduct puts them beyond the purview of the statute and that is what we think is the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.794" offset="11014514">Under 1981, we joined issue with the other parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.914" offset="11042935">We say that the face of the statute does not accommodate this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2884.591" offset="11641662">Now, in making that language, Congress thus established the rights possessed by white citizens as the yardstick for measuring the rights of all citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.277" offset="11692444">And this case does not fit the statute for the simple reason that they require the Court to say now that we are going to take the yardstick of black citizens in a single isolated episode of theft to provide a converse or reciprocal cause of action for white people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3696.052" offset="14887533">First, I would like to make the observation that the petitioners have simply never been convicted of any crime, theft or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.170" offset="14927970">There has been an allegation that there were 26 cans of anti freeze misappropriated and I remind the Court that in the McDonnell case, the Green, we had a convicted confessed misdemeanant, so I simply reject Mr. Dixie’s proposition plus if we talk of flood gates then a criteria is created where the mere allegation of wrongdoing constitutes the basis for discharge without the embrace of Title VII or 1981, it is likely the 10 years of ameliorating judicial interpretation of Title VII will go out the window.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.765" offset="15110409">This is precisely what happened in the hundreds of cases upon which Title VII claims were based.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.120" offset="15135800">Mr. Dixie asks for reasons why we should have 1981 and why we should only worry about two people here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.399" offset="15168924">One of the reasons is precisely that these petitioners and in particular Mr. Laird, he never filed a Title VII charge at the EEOC, so it is all together possible depending on constructions placed on his failure to file that 1981 is his only avenue of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.921" offset="15246978">Furthermore, many hypotheticals have been tossed around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.136" offset="15263905">If it turned out for example that this employer had less than 15 employees, 1981 is a necessary vehicle for redeeming discrimination if it occurs whether preferences are for the majority or minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.664" offset="15353975">We have heard much of the legislative history.</text>
