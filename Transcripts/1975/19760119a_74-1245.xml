            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103376">We will hear arguments next in Liberty Mutual Insurance Company against Wetzel.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.882" offset="322805">Mr. Grove, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kalvin M. Grove</label>
            <text syncTime="58.111" offset="335761">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.561" offset="349554">This case comes to you today on review from the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which reviewing Liberty Mutual Insurance Company’s Disability Program for its employees, determined that that plan violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.376" offset="416845">I think it is important for this Court to know just exactly what their plan is and what it provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.097" offset="443699">First of all, besides excluding from coverage, disability due to pregnancy and complications from pregnancy, that plan has numerous other exclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.602" offset="489779">It does not cover disabilities due to self-inflicted wounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.898" offset="506916">It does not cover disabilities unless the employee is under the care of a licensed physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.788" offset="530426">It does not cover acts of suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.498" offset="541293">It does not cover acts which are the cause of declared or undeclared war and it does not cover emotional disorders, alcoholism, or narcotics or drug addiction unless again the employee is under the care of a licensed physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.358" offset="600747">The plan provides that contributions are made by the employees no matter what their sex in equal amounts and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company in turn contributes to the plan equally no matter what the person’s sex is.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.630" offset="661874">The Third Circuit held that this Court’s decision in Geduldig versus Aiello was not applicable because of the fact that that case arose under the Fourteenth Amendment and that this case arises under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.200" offset="720075">We submit to this Court that the court’s reasoning in Aiello is directly in line with Title VII and there is no reason why that thinking should not be applied to a Title VII Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.035" offset="775454">The question is, is it discrimination and no matter what the standard is that is the question that has to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.378" offset="804816">In this Court, in a similar situation, in fact the California Disability Plan is very similar to the Liberty Plan, held that absent a showing, that the exclusion of a risk was pretext to engage in an invidious discrimination, you could do such and Liberty Mutual here because of valid and cogent region has decided to exclude certain disabilities under its plan and I submit to this Court that under your thinking that is not discrimination based on sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.202" offset="940130">The Court of Appeals said that you could not apply Aiello because of the fact, again, as I repeated that is a Fourteenth Amendment case and Title VII cannot apply, suggests that that is improper and should not be the holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.266" offset="996346">This Court specifically in response to I believe Mr. Justice Brennan’s dissent and Mr. Justice Marshall’s dissent in a footnote indicated that the policy was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.604" offset="1045769">It seems to me that if this Court is going to review Aiello, then Aiello should be affirmed and the Court should say that that case is applicable to Title VII.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="247.012" offset="1091327">Well, you would not suggest that Congress could not go further in prohibiting employment practices than the Fourteenth Amendment if it so chose, would you?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kalvin_m_grove" startTime="257.656" stopTime="458.340">
            <label>Mr. Kalvin M. Grove</label>
            <text syncTime="257.656" offset="1133959">I agree with that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.690" offset="1138034">If Congress so chose, but we submit the Congress did not so choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.891" offset="1154857">If Aiello was not applied, you are going to have a result of at least in those states where the state is the carrier such as California and other states, the insurance carrier, where the state under the umbrella of Aiello will not need to provide this benefit, but the state as an employer will have to provide the benefit to its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.532" offset="1241479">You are going to have one standard for the state as the insurance carrier and another standard for the state as an employer and to me, that result is not what Title VII or the Fourteenth Amendment is supposed to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.908" offset="1291007">I think that we as practitioners in this area are looking for some guidance from the Court because there are as you know by the numerous briefs that have been filed in this case, the parties are squarely on one side or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.903" offset="1346909">Everyone is citing that the Fourteenth Amendment says that you did not mean what you said, and therefore, you need to come up with a new standard and the other side, the Liberty side if you will, says that what you meant is exactly applicable to Title VII and I do not think that we should have different standards for the determination of what is discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.939" offset="1431128">The Court of Appeals, after summarily dismissing Aiello with a one very quick brief sentence, then went on and said that because of three things; number one that because the EEOC has come down with guidelines which indicate this policy is violated and since they have some expertise in the area, the Court should defer to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.550" offset="1537498">I suggest in this situation that the EEOC Guidelines as in the Espinosa (ph) should not be given deference to.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.727" offset="1574279">As the Court is well aware and it is stated in the briefs, from 1965 when Title VII became applicable until after this lawsuit was filed, the commission was on record as stating that a policy such as Liberty Mutuals was not in violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.019" offset="1643451">And as in any hearings, requests from experts if you will, requests for interested employer’s associations or anyone else, the EEOC all of the sudden came down and changed its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.086" offset="1695696">But yet in the Aiello case before you the EEOC’s amicus brief clearly indicated that what you were going to hold in Aiello could be dispositive of Title VII cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.173" offset="1748045">Of course now, the EEOC comes down with their guideline and so it is just exactly opposite and I suggest that they should not be entitled to the deference normally granted to an agency because you have a shifting stand situation here and they are no more expert in this situation than I submit this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.650" offset="1821920">The Third Circuit then went on to say that because Liberty Mutual has so many coverages under its policy that it is unreasonable for it to exclude pregnancy and disabilities due to pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.660" offset="1882001">Therefore, they cannot sustain that exclusion and I respectfully submit that I think the Third Circuit read the plan wrong because as I have just read to you, the plan does have numerous situations where disabilities are excluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.194" offset="2020137">If there were changes and I submit I do not know, they were to include more as opposed to taking out some, that is more disabilities would be included as being excluded from the plan’s coverage.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.871" offset="2086801">I think there have been, but I am unfamiliar with it. Over the years that Liberty Mutual Insurance Company has been in business, I cannot tell you how many years and I am sure that over the years there have been some changes, but I am frankly unfamiliar with all the changes.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="509.524" offset="2141449">Is there any legislative history so to speak, any explanation in the record anywhere as to these, I do not mean now, post hoc explanation or rationalization, but any historic explanation for the exclusions and exceptions of this plan?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kalvin_m_grove" startTime="529.698" stopTime="671.162">
            <label>Mr. Kalvin M. Grove</label>
            <text syncTime="529.698" offset="2222116">No, there was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.509" offset="2229325">It was just, this plan that was litigated and there was no attempt by either side, if you will, to go back into history to determine those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.441" offset="2269136">Lastly, the Court of Appeals indicated that the proper standard to determine this case, again was not Aiello but Griggs versus Duke Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.825" offset="2310618">We submit that under Griggs versus Duke Power, you do not have a violation in this type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.414" offset="2336950">We must remember that all women and all men at Liberty Mutual Insurance Company under this plan received exactly the same contribution from the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.251" offset="2380313">They make the same contribution and the benefits to all are exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.447" offset="2401107">For every disability to the man may have, a woman has the same coverage under the plan and I submit to this Court that there are rational basis for Liberty Mutual's Plan, the record so indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.437" offset="2461084">First of all, as long as there is no evidence that the plan was instituted or the exclusion was instituted as a pretext to engage invidious discrimination then an employer is free to exclude whatever he wants from the disability plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.234" offset="2524300">I submit to you that this record does not sustain a showing that Liberty Mutual Insurance Company engaged in a pretext of excluded maternity, a pretext to engage in invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.202" offset="2572156">The plan is such so that the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company can pay to its employees the maximum of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.066" offset="2599637">The company has determined, based upon statistics that it had that if it was to cover the disability of maternity and complications due to maternity that that would be the greatest number of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.475" offset="2649270">It would be the greatest drain on the plan, and therefore, it felt that it would either have to revise its plan, it would have to contribute more, require the employees to contribute more, and therefore, it did not desire to do such.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.690" offset="2702037">And that is exactly what this Court discussed in Aiello, said exactly the same thing that the State of California was desirous of maintaining the integrity and sanctity of its plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.637" offset="2749894">The state felt in its wisdom that if it covered the disability in Aiello what was normal pregnancy, it could distort the plan and said that that was perfectly legitimate.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.162" offset="2787928">Mr. Grove, sometime during your argument, would you comment on why you think the District Court’s order was appealable to the Third Circuit?</text>
            <text syncTime="679.477" offset="2821260">As I read the complaint, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, they sought damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.960" offset="2847174">The District Court gave them neither, but nonetheless said it was entering a final judgment and the Third Circuit said we have jurisdiction under 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.115" offset="2883745">Now, certainly in a personal injury action, if the plaintiff sues, gets a judgment on liability and then District Court says this is a final judgment, the defendant cannot appeal without certification.</text>

            <text syncTime="745.555" offset="3085515">Many of the cases, in fact Title VII is the exact situation where it is being practiced heavily where the judges are splitting the issue of liability and damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.114" offset="3123758">Only hearing the matter of liability because determining damages in these cases as you know is extremely complicated and the courts are issuing determinations on liability, letting those go to the Court of Appeals and then coming back.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.733" offset="3718305">I have the privilege of representing the respondents, Mrs. Wetzel and Mrs. Ross in a matter now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.957" offset="3751115">It was not my intention to track in any way the arguments made by or on behalf of the petitioner, but it may be that I can answer to some extent, or at least one of the questions posed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.582" offset="3809629">Mr. Justice Stewart asked the question concerning the age of the plan here in question and whether any explanation for the evolution of the plan and the exclusions was ever given below.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.306" offset="3868561">Contained in the joint appendix are a series of exhibits and they begin at page 90.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.619" offset="3909835">They were exhibits to the plaintiff’s brief for summary judgment below and they were made part of the record by affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.424" offset="3940973">The affidavit which described them begins at page 86 and reveals that the exclusion with which we are concerned was in existence at least as early as March 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.925" offset="3999069">The subsequent exhibits deal with later changes in the plan, but to the extent that there were changes, those changes generally did not relate to changes in coverage, but rather to --</text>

            <text syncTime="993.641" offset="4077854">Now, in addition to the extent that Mr. Grove talks about the fact that there are other exclusions in the plan and as described, those exclusions, it is imperative to note that many of the exclusions to which he made reference are nowhere in the record below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.969" offset="4171164">The plan which he has described is the plan which is annexed as an appendix to the petitioner’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.498" offset="4197286">It is a plan which was never made part of the record in the District Court or the Court of Appeals in which as far as anyone in this case knows was never in existence until the day that I saw their brief for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.176" offset="4259980">With respect to the contention, that the plan also excludes coverage for complications due to pregnancy, some clarification is in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.699" offset="4322152">The Court of Appeals did indeed state that the plan excluded complications and of course that was not the case in Aiello where only normal pregnancy was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.547" offset="4365515">I think it is a bit unfair to the Court of Appeals, however, to state as to the petitioner in its brief that it misconstrued the plan by assuming that there was no coverage for complications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.343" offset="4424656">There is on file with this Court, a transcript of the argument which was held before the Court of Appeals in October of 1973 or 1974, I have forgotten which at this point, where there was a colloquy between various members of the Court and Mr. Grove who argued for the petitioner and after repeated questions in which Mr. Grove acknowledged that complications were not covered and where they discussed specific complications such as hypertension, blood poisoning and others, the Court asked, but it is clearly understood, and this is at page 6 of the transcript, but it is clearly understood that if we have a normal pregnancy or a pregnancy with complications neither are covered and the response was that is correct under my client’s policy that is in issue here today.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1142.224" offset="4672192">So it was colloquy in the Court of Appeals?</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard A. Specter</label>
            <text syncTime="1144.075" offset="4679611">Yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.839" offset="4702703">Now in enacting Title VII, as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress had several objectives and of course there was the objective of guaranteeing equal employment opportunity without regard to sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.240" offset="4776264">The guaranteeing also in the employment context, the preservation of the individual employee’s dignity as a person, as an employee without regard to sex among other criteria and the objective of maximizing the utilization of the human resources of this country by not discriminating on the basis of sex or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.885" offset="4894860">And I do not think it takes prolonged argument to demonstrate the extent to which this Court in recent opinions has recognized the evolution of women’s role in American Commerce since Mr. Justice Bradley wrote in Bradwell versus Illinois that in the divine nature of things, women are unfit to engage in the ordinary occupations of civil life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.475" offset="5009276">This Court has long since recognized that those days are over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.121" offset="5031846">Notwithstanding the petitioner’s longstanding practice of segregating job classifications by sex as the trial in Appellate Courts found that it did in this case, I expect that very few people would suggest today that men and women are not similarly situated in the employment context and that women are not able to hold virtually every job that men are with the possible exception of the narrow bona fide occupational qualification test which is specifically set forth in the statute and which was not raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.422" offset="5185028">Now, even though they are similarly situated in the employment context, of course it is fundamental that men and women are in many ways different as indeed they must be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.503" offset="5245319">And perhaps, the most fundamental difference lies in the fact that only women can become pregnant and when they do, to one extent or another and for one period of time or another, they become disabled and men do not get pregnant and to that extent they are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.384" offset="5344898">But so long as employers, like the petitioner in this case, are permitted to fire employees, women employees simply because they are pregnant without regard to disability and so long as they are found, as long as they are permitted to impose mandatory, unpaid leaves of absence without regard to ability to work just because they are pregnant and so long as practices like the one involved here where comprehensive income protection benefits are provided for virtually every disability to which a man can be subjected and none for the one disability unique to the woman, then those guarantees that Title VII was intended to protect of equal employment opportunity and human dignity are in fact unachievable today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.311" offset="5592538">I think Mr. Grove accurately stated the question as, did Congress intend to go that far?</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.532" offset="5641440">I think it should be pointed out that there are any number of aids to statutory construction in dealing with the precise issue here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.024" offset="5695461">It would require a remarkable lack of candor on my part, however, if I were to argue that the specific legislative history dealing with the addition of the word “sex” to Title VII was very enlightening in and of itself, it is clearly not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.335" offset="5780620">But it must be remembered that one year before the enactment of Title VII, the same Congress, the 88th Congress enacted the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.464" offset="5833178">And there is copious legislative history concerning the Equal Pay Act and copious legislative history involving the practice which is in question here because the opponents of the Act went to Congress as they are now coming to this Court and took the position that because it costs a certain amount of money to employ women because they become pregnant and disabled and disability benefits sometimes have to be provided and in fact, they were provided to most women that employers should be permitted to pay women less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.513" offset="5989391">They should be permitted to take into account the fact of pregnancy and the cost of pregnancy related disabilities in order to pay them less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.951" offset="6027112">The legislative history and in fact a bill and an amendment were introduced which would have provided just that and they were rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.093" offset="6071729">There is an extensive treatment of the legislative history and I will not dwell on it, but it can be found in the brief of the respondents in the next case to be argued at pages 121 to 138.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.228" offset="6140274">Now, certain things happened after the enactment of Title VII in Congress too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.246" offset="6180294">We became involved with the Equal Rights Amendment upon which many of the petitioner's amici and this petitioner rely, they rely upon the legislative history of that Act and they assert that the legislative history of the Equal Rights Amendment supports the contention that the practice involved here should survive a Title VII attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.697" offset="6286142">I would only point out that there was a law review article prepared by a number of scholars entitled a Constitutional basis for equal rights for women, it was published at 80, Yale Law Journal 871 and it was submitted to every member of Congress in connection with the consideration of Equal Rights Amendment and it was deemed by Congress to be primarily legislative history in connection with that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.518" offset="6413410">And the authors of that article in response to General Electric’s brief have submitted an amicus curiae brief to this Court in the General Electric case in which they track the legislative history of the Equal Rights Amendment and point out the way in which it has been portrayed to this Court and reached the conclusion that the challenged practice here today would not survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.588" offset="6529707">It is also important to note that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission whose guidelines were sustained or upheld by the Court below did not adapt a new position overnight in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.330" offset="6600656">As pointed out in our brief and the brief of the various amici in support of our position, as early as 1970, before Congress had an opportunity to amend the Act in 1972, the EEOC had developed, not the guidelines, but the principle, the premise which has evolved into the guidelines and had published various decisions which made it clear that from the EEOC’s point of view, disparate treatment based upon the fact of pregnancy was condemned by the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.316" offset="6900542">Now, even after that and perhaps most significantly because the petitioner has not responded to it, the Educational Amendments Act of 1972 and 1974 were enacted and provided for prohibitions against sex discrimination in federally funded educational projects and delegated to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare the authority to promulgate regulations to carry out those amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.241" offset="7060307">And Congress provided that unlike the EEOC’s guidelines, HEW would have to publish the regulations in advance of an effective date and submit them to Congress and that if Congress did not reject them or alter them within 45 days, they would be self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.740" offset="7146302">They were published, they were transmitted and they became effective and they are virtually identical to the guidelines involved here today and they certainly would indicate the current view of Congress and I think under the philosophy enunciated by Mr. Justice Cardozo in Burnet versus Guggenheim demonstrate what it is that Congress would have done back in 1964 when considering the issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2285.234" offset="9244248">A number of things can be said about Aiello which distinguished it from this case aside from the obvious fact that it was a Fourteenth Amendment case, dealing with the state’s social welfare policy and not a Title VII case, involving a relationship between an employer and an employee under a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.473" offset="9337244">One is that unlike the situation here, California so fit to come into Court and explain why the plan contained the exclusions that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.348" offset="9404744">And in fact, when an effort was made to ascertain why the petitioner in this case excluded the benefits that we are talking about today, the only explanation ever proffered was on advice of counsel and as a matter of statutory construction, it is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.645" offset="9485933">There was never any justification given in terms of, well, it was done because it will cost as this much or it was done because we are concerned about the welfare of certain of our employees or it was done because we do not have enough money to do it or for any other explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.179" offset="9568062">The position was about this case on the facts, on the language of the plan was right for summary judgment and no explanation for the reason behind the plan is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.281" offset="9628457">Now, I think you get into the question of burden of proof to some extent when you reach that point because in the previous opinions of this Court, in Title VII situations, relatively light burdens have been imposed upon employees for making a prima facie tests and the test has been declared, in other cases to be one of basic fairness and it has been stated that of course the standard varies from case to case, but I would point only that in this situation, no one but the employer knows why it did what it did and why it excluded whatever it excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.616" offset="9813822">And once it was demonstrated under the standards annunciated by this Court that only women were affected by this program, the burden in fairness then shifted to the employer to come forward with whatever simple or complex explanation it might have had for the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.265" offset="9904414">And with respect to any other defenses which have been suggested in the briefs or today at oral argument, I would only comment very briefly that there were absolutely no defenses suggested, raised, briefed or argued below and it is fundamental that this is neither the time nor the place to assert them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.973" offset="12295245">What is important though is the plan; Mr. Specter argues about the impact, but this plan if you look at it has impact in disproportion in statistics against others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.792" offset="12338504">Statistically, I presume that one might be able to show that males attempt suicide in a greater rate than women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.433" offset="12369015">So because we exclude that, I supposed we are discriminating against males.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.932" offset="12383017">One might legitimately argue I suppose that statistically men have alcoholic problems greater than women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.875" offset="12414782">I do not know if you can prove that, but just assume, so we do not cover that unless there is a licensed physician so we probably are excluding or discriminating against men in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.882" offset="12450831">I think the whole thing goes to say and really in summary, that an employer such as Liberty Mutual or anybody else can exclude in his wisdom anything under its disability program as long as it cannot be proven that that is a pretext to engage in invidious discrimination and that is the thing that is missing in this case and I would just like to say to indicate to the Court that Judge Webber on the Fourth Circuit in his dissent in the GE case which is of course is again the next case, really said it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.447" offset="12581129">And I might in end, I will sit down, in that he said, the inquiry in this case must therefore focus initially on whether exclusion of pregnancy related disability from the disability benefits plan is sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.979" offset="12639226">If it is not sex discrimination, then regardless of what test is applied there is no Title VII violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.482" offset="12669214">Absolute showing of sex discrimination, Title VII, even if its reach were broader than the Equal Protection Clause would not render unlawful a pregnancy exclusion such as that involved here.</text>
