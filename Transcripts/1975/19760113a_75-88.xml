            <text syncTime="13.570" offset="157579">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.520" offset="169387">This case like the one just argued, arises from the Secretary’s denial of Insurance, Child’s Insurance Benefits, to the illegitimate children of a deceased wage earner, on the ground that the wage earner had not been supporting or living with the children at the time of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.840" offset="242634">In this case, however, the claimants brought suit for review only of the Secretary’s specific denial of benefits to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.703" offset="270115">It did not request either injunctive or class relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.280" offset="284430">The District Court sustained the Secretary’s findings supported by substantial evidence, but nevertheless reversed without issuing injunction, the denial of benefits on the ground that the statutory eligibility requirement of support of co-residence, denied illegitimate children due process under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.135" offset="359871">Since in so holding, the District Court held a statute of -- held an Active Congress unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.545" offset="381501">This Court plainly has jurisdiction under Section 1252 of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.116" offset="407728">Proper analysis of this case requires a full understanding of the statutory scheme for the distribution of Child’s Insurance Benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.290" offset="444508">The formal linchpin of that scheme is dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.159" offset="459973">Under Section 202 (d) (1) (c) of the Social Security Act, payment of Child’s Insurance Benefits are made only on behalf of the dependent children or disabled, retired or deceased wage earners.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.750" offset="518278">However, the Act presumes dependency as a matter of law for most children.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.544" offset="537504">As to legitimate children, the Act presumes dependency if the child is not been adopted by another wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.626" offset="569791">Dependency is also presumed with regard to four categories of illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.533" offset="589436">First, children whose parents went through a marriage ceremony that was rendered invalid by non-obviously legal impediment.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.928" offset="619006">Second, children whose father had knowledge paternity in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.307" offset="636560">Third, children whose father’s paternity was decreed by court and fourth, children whose father was ordered by a court to contribute to their support.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.418" offset="680969">Dependency is not presumed with regard to other illegitimate children or to legitimate children who are illegitimate adopted children seeking benefits on behalf of their natural parents’ Social Security Account.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.748" offset="738333">In order to be entitled to Child's Insurance Benefits, these latter categories of children must prove that the wage earner was in fact their father and also that their father was living with or contributing to their support at the time of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.617" offset="793713">Now, it is a constitutional validity of this statutory classification that is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.971" offset="819209">The appellees here, the Lucas children, are children that must prove dependency as a condition of eligibility for Child’s Insurance Benefits under the Act and they challenge that requirement as a denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.578" offset="877618">At the out set of this case, it is necessary to address the question of the appropriate standard of review, and with the Courts indulgence, I propose to approach this question in a largely philosophical manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.192" offset="948045">The briefs in both this and the preceding case, the Norton case, proceed upon the premise that the two-tiered equal protection analysis that evolved in the late 1960s still governs the adjudication of equal protection cases and upon reflection, I have concluded that this premise is probably erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.469" offset="1037174">This Court appears in large part too have abandoned the two-tiered equal protection analysis and I think for good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.887" offset="1074895">The development of a two-tiered equal protection analysis appears to have been an interim judicial response to the perceived failure of the traditional rational basis test, sufficiently to protect certain disadvantaged groups and to vindicate certain important interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.798" offset="1146471">And this Court determined that statutes adversely affecting such groups or impinging upon such interests would be subjected to very close judicial scrutiny and would be sustained only if they satisfied or served a compelling governmental interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.615" offset="1337791">But other classifications continued to be reviewed under the traditional rational basis test which required only a minimal showing of rationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.843" offset="1374676">And this two-tiered approached had a lot of obvious difficulties to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.238" offset="1400276">One of these was in knowing to which tier a particular case belonged.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.244" offset="1420234">Outside the area of race, there appear to be no available constitutional standards for defining suspectness, that is for selecting a groups with respect to whom statutory classifications would be considered inherently suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.240" offset="1484286">Similarly, there are few, if any, constitutional guide posts for determining what interests are so important as to be fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.627" offset="1517827">Another difficulty with the two-tier analysis is that it is never been easy to articulate an adequate constitutional justification for the dramatic gap that existed between the two levels of equal protection review.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.319" offset="1808622">First, in the recent past, it has resisted attempts by litigants to add new classifications to the suspect list of a higher tier.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.629" offset="1845821">But secondly and perhaps more importantly, in many putatively lower tier cases, the court has departed from the traditional rational basis test by requiring a more persuasive showing than in the past; that the means chosen by the legislature serve an actual and permissible legislative objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.023" offset="1919382">In particular, this stronger showing has been required for the challenged statutory classification, defined the class in such a manner as to create the suspicion that the legislature may have been discriminating against it, against the class without just cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.563" offset="1981553">In this latter development of a stricter irrational basis standard of review, in large part has rendered the two-tier analysis obsolete.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.369" offset="2020737">Accordingly, I think it is unrealistic for the appellees here to insist upon a compelling governmental interest standard of review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.409" offset="4872890">There is nothing in the legislative history that suggests that the statutory classification was motivated by congressional hostility to illegitimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.890" offset="4906849">Moreover, the extension of the presumption of dependency in this case, the four categories of illegitimates and the withholding of it from a category of illegitimate children would refute I would think any suggestion that the statutory pattern itself reveals a purpose of invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.776" offset="4978425">Therefore, this is not a case arguably like Levy or Glona, where the legislative objective was the impermissible one of expressing moral disapproval of the state of a legitimacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.812" offset="5034536">Now, two other legislative objectives that I think should be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.565" offset="5057524">One, clearly supports the constitutionality of the statute and the other appears not to do so, and I will take up these in reverse order quickly if I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.900" offset="5098902">It seems to me that the claimant’s best argument here begins with the contention that the legislative objective was to restrict the payment of benefits to children whether or not actually dependent who had a legal right to be supported by the wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.852" offset="5162745">That would be of course permissible legislative objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.204" offset="5176120">Although, the evidence is conflicting, there is some arguable basis for that view in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.869" offset="5206735">But their argument perceives as I understand it that the statutory scheme may have been constitutional at the time of enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.458" offset="5237142">That the premise on which it was base was undone by this Court’s decision in Gomez against Perez, where it was held at the state must grant an illegitimate child, the same right to support from his father as is possessed by the legitimate child and under this line of reasoning since the members of the complainant class now have the same right to parental support as all other children, the denial to them of Child's Insurance Benefits does not further the original purpose of the Act, and therefore, should not be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.151" offset="5359917">Of that I think, is a plausible approach to the problem at hand that there is an equally plausible approach that would sustain a statute and in these circumstances, this Court should of course have difference to Congress, choose the course that sustains the validity of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.618" offset="5433791">Now, as we point at pages 32 through 36 of our brief, the Norton case, there is a substantial evidence, both in the legislative history and directly inferable from this statutory scheme that the purpose of the Child’s Insurance Benefits program is to provide support only for the dependent children of disabled, retired or deceased wage earners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.354" offset="5544760">And that the purpose of acquiring members of the complainant class to prove co-residence or support is to restrict the payment of benefits, to restrict the payment of benefits to those children who may reasonably be presumed to have been dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.095" offset="5611633">If that is the correct view of the statutory purposes and we submit that it is, then the statutory scheme must be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.769" offset="5646324">It clearly was permissible for Congress to seek to restrict the payment of dependency benefits to children who reasonably could be presumed to be dependent and the requirement that the members of the complainant class prove dependency, prove support or co-residence furthers that permissible legislative objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.121" offset="5731796">The opposition expressed to this line of reasoning by the District Court in this case was that under that view of the statutory purposes, the statute is allegedly over inclusive in that it grants benefits to some children who are not actually dependent upon the parental wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.261" offset="5816329">And I would offer two answers to the argument of over inclusiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.152" offset="5835868">The first is the statute is not in fact over inclusive, and the second is that in any event mere over inclusiveness is not as sufficient basis from invalidating the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.967" offset="5887173">The statute is not over inclusive in the terms that I have described it, that is to pay benefits to children who could reasonably be presumed to have been dependent upon parental wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.541" offset="5933462">As we point out at pages 38 and 39 of our brief in Norton as the District Court correctly observed in that case, it was not unreasonable for Congress to have extended the presumption of the dependency to most legitimate children and to four specifically defined categories of illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.075" offset="6015591">At the same time, the members of the complainant class could not reasonably have been presumed to be dependent upon their fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.464" offset="6045161">Since the statutory purposes the modest one of separating those classes as to which the presumption of the dependency is reasonable from those is to which it is not reasonable, the statute is not in fact over inclusive in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.532" offset="6101377">But finally, even if the statute were dimmed over inclusive because it fails to weed out some non-dependent children from the list of beneficiaries, that would not justify judicial enlargement of the class of beneficiaries to include all other non dependent children as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.328" offset="6172639">A statute that is over inclusive, but not under inclusive, that is a statute that grants benefits to some persons who are outside the statutory rationale, but it is not denied benefits to any persons who are within the statutory rationale, should not except for absent the most extraordinary circumstances, be struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.792" offset="6258425">The realities of the legislative process and the complexities of administration ordinarily prevent a perfect matching of legislative purpose and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.599" offset="6297713">A permissible legislative purpose such as the purpose here of restricting benefits, the children who could reasonable be presumed to be dependent upon their wage earner father should not be abandoned wholesale by the courts, merely because that purpose has not been carried out by the legislature with precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.587" offset="6377648">Accordingly, the statute here is the denial of benefits to this children furthers a legitimate and actual legislative objective that should be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.096" offset="6491646">We contend that this class of illegitimate children meets all the traditional criterion which had been applied -- criteria which had been applied to be pop this class within the strict scrutiny standard test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.636" offset="6549847">On the other hand, it seems quite clear that the Dandridge versus Williams test does not apply here for the same reasons that did not apply in Jimenez case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.349" offset="6600733">Now, it is not totally important to us as to what label we put on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.968" offset="6623199">Is this is a strict scrutiny test or it is just a traditional test?</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.055" offset="6639499">At the very least, we think that it has to be dealt with very high scrutiny and it is not so important as to what we call it, but it is more important as to what this Court does.</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.838" offset="6986614">That is a very significant fact because if the Government has to come forth and say something, that means a lot to the outcome of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.887" offset="7182846">Well, let me lead in because that obviously leads into what they did intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.432" offset="7201027">The Congress has set up a structure which is basically as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.440" offset="7225060">First of all, everyone has to prove that a individual was indeed a wage earner covered by the Act, employed for so many months and so forth, so many quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.377" offset="7256825">Also they have to apply, also they have to be under either eighteen or twenty-two-and-half to be unmarried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.420" offset="7276991">Those are the non-controversy or preconditions that have to be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.493" offset="7293292">There are two major preconditions however.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.633" offset="7301860">One is that the paternity has to be shown and the second is that the dependency has to be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.587" offset="7329654">Now, what the Act does is, it sets up a dependency requirement and then it wipes it away for everyone except for two classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.544" offset="7361524">One class is a class in this case, a certain class of illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.904" offset="7378869">The second class consists of adopted children and stepchildren.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.485" offset="7393289">Now, there is a special reason for adopted children and stepchildren to have to establish actual dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.459" offset="7417112">Indeed, in fact, they were dependent or supported by the deceased wage earners and that is because they have two potential wage earners upon which to claim benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.763" offset="7454311">Adopted child has its natural father that he can claim benefits upon or has a new adopted father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.968" offset="7475209">Same goes for stepchildren.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.131" offset="7483777">Now, unfortunately, this class of illegitimate children has been lumped in with this latter category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.478" offset="7505197">Unfortunately, illegitimate children much less than having two parents to look to for support after that parent dies or before he dies, generally, often have no parents at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.385" offset="7552845">Therefore, it seems to be good reason to require adopted children and step children to prove this, but I contend that there is no reason to require this class of illegitimate children to prove this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.205" offset="7596103">Now, what the court below and what the Secretary has argued the purposes is as follows: That really the Congress instructions the Social Security Act, intended to only replace support that was actually lost, that is the only intend to give benefits to the children of fathers who actually did support them prior to the father’s death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.295" offset="7680427">We cite in our briefs the rather explicit legislative history which seems to counter this notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.451" offset="7709057">There are two documents that say that the Act intents to give benefits to those who did receive support prior to their father’s death and those who owe the obligation to receive support prior to their father’s death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.974" offset="7767153">We contend that that more clearly articulates Congress’s reasoning, not just to give benefits to those who actually got it, but also to give benefits to those who were in a position that they should have actually gotten it, but for some reason their father failed to live up to that obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.086" offset="7839669">What the District Court below did in order to add on to that reason is the District Court below assumed that Congress set up a category that those people will not have to prove actual support before the father died if it is more likely that they indeed were supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.646" offset="7909886">This is a very similar to Frontiero versus Richardson this Court has encountered before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.890" offset="7934859">In other words, legitimate children are presumed generally to have been supported, therefore, to save administrative convenience that category will not have to establish that they were in fact supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.032" offset="7979476">Now, our briefs establish that assuming that indeed Congress had such a notion which we do not think they do because the Congressional history does not seem to indicate that, but they indeed did have that notion, the Act has very aptly attempted to pursue that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.253" offset="8048335">There is no guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.697" offset="8054082">There are only two studies that seemed of reflect upon this and both result an ambiguous conclusion as to whether or not who is more likely than someone else to have actually been supportive prior to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.052" offset="8127538">Accordingly, it seems highly likely that even if we assume that Congress did indeed intent to only give benefits to those people who were actually supported prior the death, that they did really accomplish that in any meaningful way.</text>

            <text syncTime="2671.332" offset="10788580">The Senate Report on the amendments enacting this provision, state just correctly describe the Act as a national program that is intended to pay benefits to replace the support lost by a child when his father dies and this Court recognized this statutory purpose in its opinion in Jimenez against Weinberger where it pointed out that the primary purpose of the program is to provide support for dependents of a wage earner and third, the validity of the presumptions of dependency for the categories of children who do not have to prove dependency are we think broadly rational for the reasons set forth at pages 38 and 39 of our brief and I would further point out that if the evidence is conflicting, if in some instances those presumptions may not be broadly rational, nevertheless, that boils down simply to a claim that the statute is over inclusive in its provision of benefits, not under inclusive for the reasons I set forth in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.120" offset="11043744">Mere over inclusiveness would not result invalidity of the statute.</text>
