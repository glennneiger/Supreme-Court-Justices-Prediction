            <label>Mr. Peter C. Andresen</label>
            <text syncTime="56.412" offset="328956">Good morning Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.624" offset="369812">Initially, Your Honors, I would like to set the scene, involved in the search and its fruits which are complained of in this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.838" offset="442641">There existed between petitioner and a local bank, a dispute as to application of payments, which were forwarded, to the bank to extinguish a particular lien, which encompass several properties in a subdivision in Montgomery County.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.026" offset="531458">It was the basis of this dispute that provided the hearsay evidence and information upon which the affidavits of the police officers were based which was used to obtain the search warrant to search the petitioner’s offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.728" offset="622259">The dispute arose because the indebted party for whose benefit the payments were being forwarded to the bank was the credit -- was the debtor on two separate debts, one of which was a lien debt, the other which was a personal debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.677" offset="710031">And although the checks in their accompanying letters and releases which were mailed to the bank in each instance were forwarded by messenger, stipulated that the money was to be applied to a particular debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.305" offset="760499">The bank instead was applying the money to the personal rather than the secured debt and this came to light later in a civil case involving the same subject matter, in which it was held that the bank was erroneously doing so and in fact the lien complained of had been extinguished some months prior to the acts complained of which lead to the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.896" offset="858929">However, this was a scene upon which the information was related to the investigators who swore to the affidavit contained in the warrant upon which the Circuit Court Judge issued and found probable cause and issued the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.065" offset="939595">Now the warrants, there were two in number, called for the search of petitioner’s law offices and also another office which was occupied jointly by petitioner for storage of his files and with some corporate offices of which the involvement is not completely clear, but the petitioner did have some involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.623" offset="1053802">There were two separate warrants based upon the same affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.942" offset="1083059">The majority of the affidavits were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.636" offset="1093822">I think one of the affidavits had some additional information and that was the search of the corporate offices, it had some additional information to establish that petitioner’s legal files were maintained in storage and that some of his employees did work in part of that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.892" offset="1178876">Now, the law office itself, picture if you will, a reception room with a secretary and other chairs and one desk, a large office type room which was entered into, through the reception room, contained several file cabinets along one wall, completely in line with one wall, other file cabinets, approximately five to seven desks with their contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.760" offset="1318370">Piles of papers on each of this desk, a conference room and two lawyer’s offices of which there were book cases containing papers, credenzas with papers, a desk, completely average legal office.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.797" offset="1394543">Papers from everywhere and contained in every desk drawer.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.011" offset="1419307">The auxiliary office was containing even more files and title files, was occupied in part by petitioner and his law clerk and used for reference to these files when preparing title abstracts information because petitioner was a Title Attorney and heavily engaged in not only real property practice, but handling transfers of real estate in Montgomery County.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.978" offset="1543232">Petitioner had handled at the time of the search, according to his files, over 5,000 property cases since he conceived this practice, all of which files are maintained in these two locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.050" offset="1607494">Now, some of the files are very voluminous, some of the transfers were dependent on prior transfers, and therefore, the files were not so voluminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.776" offset="1642393">But the files comprised so much space that even though petitioner's office was a 1,200 to 1,400 foot category and in a neighborhood of five to seven employees beside himself in it, that he had to have additional space in order to store the balance of the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.800" offset="1730478">That is the scene upon which the officers entered with the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.338" offset="1760676">The affidavit contained in the warrants, contains mostly interviews with individuals and the results of these interviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.587" offset="1849701">And in part two of the petition, petitioner complains that because there were no direct observation or personal knowledge as to the things sought in the affidavits that it was necessary for the affidavits to spell out reasons why the hearsay evidence was reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.147" offset="1959938">We maintain that there was no such information contained in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.562" offset="1993583">That the information was sought and obtained from individuals who were involved with the petitioner in the dispute which I earlier recited to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.564" offset="2037574">As a matter of fact, one of the investigators at page 36 of the brief says that he knew at the time of the affidavit that the bank officer had told him that he had received the payments complained of, but in fact applied them to another debt.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.147" offset="3935944">In Stanford, the officers carried away approximately 2,000 books and pamphlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.960" offset="3971157">In petitioner’s case, the papers were never counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.478" offset="3989234">Nobody ever in the record expressed, how many papers were seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.765" offset="4006370">We come upon a lot of different expressions as to description of the amount of paper seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.865" offset="4030821">That is because petitioner feels there were many more than could be readily counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.465" offset="4057152">At one point, the prosecuting attorney stated at page 372 of the transcript of motions that the papers comprised three file cabinet drawers full that were seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.738" offset="4146282">In other words, the officers did not carry away boxes, the type of cartons you get in a grocery market, with them carried away papers and when they got back to the office with them, they filled up three file cabinet drawers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.660" offset="4205946">I measured one of the file cabinet drawers, it is 28 inches deep, and I also measured the stack of papers and I found 240 pages in each inch of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.042" offset="4255474">So the 28 inches of file cabinet drawer would handle between six and seven thousand papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.108" offset="4283791">In three drawers then it would be an excess of 20,000 papers which were carried away and most of these papers were enclosed in large files which were enumerated as to what the file contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.507" offset="4393296">Therefore, we contend under that part of our argument, the warrant for general allowed the searchers to do too much, and therefore, should have been struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.335" offset="4484620">That is under our part 2B of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.299" offset="4516490">I am quoting from Coolidge v. New Hampshire in the brief, stated by this Court that distinct objective is that the search is deemed necessary, it should be as limited as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.884" offset="4586811">That is the purpose of the particularity of description which is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.932" offset="4639056">And the day following the search of the premises, petitioner was arrested in front of his office and charged with four counts of false pretenses which were basically as to subject matter contained in the affidavit for the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.044" offset="4731530">He was incarcerated, then released on bond approximately two weeks later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.492" offset="4757234">After a thorough study of all the papers seized, he was indicted by the grand jury in Montgomery County on approximately fifty other counts all of which were subject wise extracted from the seized papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.247" offset="4824316">At the time of the hearing on the motion to suppress the evidence seized, as pointed out in part 2A of the argument, even though the warrants were discussed in great detail and passed around and a matter of fact the hearing held comprised approximately a day-and-a half of argument and testimony, they were never -- the warrants were never actually formally introduced and as pointed out in 1A, although a technicality, we feel that the non-introduction of the warrants a technicality under our laws of evidence that cannot be dispensed with or at least some reason be shown why they were not introduced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1301.221" offset="5308209">They just feel that the non-introduction was overcome by certain things which are set out in the Court of Special Appeals opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.779" offset="5370380">Now, following that, the suppression hearing, the Trial Court required the state to establish a nexus under Warden v. Hayden, that is a connection between the articles, the individual papers seized and the crimes or the intent or the mens rea behind the crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.924" offset="5467033">Now, at this point, the state went back into a huddle, stayed overnight and completely went through the papers, disregarded approximately 75% of them as pertaining to other indictments which they were not pressing at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.652" offset="5545923">Of the balance, because of the necessity of opening the file and looking at each paper rather than establishing the connection of the complete file and why the officers seized it, went through the papers and eliminated the majority of what was left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.058" offset="5623559">So that when they got through, they had only a handful which could easily be held in one hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.372" offset="5648845">Again, I do not know the count, but only a handful of papers upon which the Trial Court did not suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.946" offset="5699105">At this point it is important to point out the argument in part 2B which refers to the motives, excuse me 2D, and I will refer it to 2D, the motives of the prosecutor as espoused by Warden v. Hayden, at page 34 of petitioner's brief, the language in Warden v. Hayden, referring to mere evidence states, and I so quote, “that probable cause must be examined in terms of cause to believe that the evidence sought would aid in a particular apprehension or conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.617" offset="5893770">In so doing consideration of police purposes will be required.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.638" offset="5913832">At this point, I think it is evident from the facts as to what the prosecutor’s motives were at this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.980" offset="5955210">They used the facts as espoused in the search warrant to obtain a warrant, search the premises, waited two weeks of sifting through the material seized, not even knowing, as is obvious from the testimony of the investigators involved, what the papers were, then using these as a basis, obtained 50 additional indictments based on the information in the paper seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.142" offset="6067850">Then consolidated the original Bill of Information with one of the indictments which contained about 17 counts for a trial at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.321" offset="6116646">And then at time of the trial, even though he failed to establish a prima-facie case throughout the entire case and the judge, trial judge refused to allow admission at that time, was able to admit this evidence under the proving allegations and the testimony which applied to the additional indictments which in fact were obtained under the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.000" offset="6223330">The indictments could not have been attained, had the search not been performed and the extent of the search has been so general that they could seize all the papers involved, with all these other indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.507" offset="6265335">We, therefore, say that under Warden v. Hayden, an examination of the prosecutor’s motives should have caused the non-introduction of this evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.437" offset="10469064">Now, those same exhibits in the petitioner’s handwriting are also on pages 65 and 66 of the Solicitor General’s appendix, and the the handwriting and you will see that there is a different settlement statement for the buyer, it is identical to the one on page 7 and it -- and day -- on page 66 you will see the handwriting for the seller’s settlement statement and again the seller statement does not correspond with the buyer’s.</text>

            <text syncTime="2730.346" offset="11024741">On November 1, 1972 an information was filed against him, charging him with four counts of false pretenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.739" offset="11186282">It began on May 21, 1973. Before the trial however, on April 11 and April 12 in 1973, a two-day hearing was conducted on the petitioner’s motion to suppress the evidence seized from his law office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.259" offset="11248349">As a result of that hearing, the state was left with 17 items of evidence of which it chose to introduce five exhibits into evidence and those five exhibits are the exhibits which are listed in the Solicitor General’s appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.459" offset="11313133">I should point out here so that there is not any confusion that their -- the search -- there were two searches, conducted on October 31.</text>

            <text syncTime="4221.131" offset="16987869">The United States is here to argue the question arising under the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.315" offset="17008558">It is our position that a defendant has no Fifth Amendment privilege to bar the admission into evidence of items seized, in this case business records from him, so long as the items were seized in compliance with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.673" offset="17069998">The purpose of my argument, I will assume that the Fourth Amendment has not been violated in this case, the petitioner suggested in his oral argument that documents, papers, books, ledgers are accorded and should be accorded special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.718" offset="17126214">That is that when such items are seized, apparently the Trial Courts review them to see if they contain ideas and petitioner contends that if they do contain ideas, then he can properly invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege to bar their introduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.359" offset="17188699">Presumably, petitioner is referring to only his ideas it seems, would seem incredible that a book found on a -- in a bomber’s apartment that said, how to make bombs which contains ideas would fall under his rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.186" offset="17240107">But in any event, what petitioner is contending now really sounds more like a First Amendment claim and the claim under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.991" offset="17275321">Why the fact that a document contains ideas, implicates the Fifth Amendment is hardly clear and is hardly clear where the Court would go, what the -- where the path would lead if the Court adopted such a doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="4554.698" offset="18322099">Now, there has been some talk about the analogy here to a subpoena duces tecum in the cases that Court has decided under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.602" offset="18353760">Petitioner seems to argue that simply because a document maybe, that he may invoke his privilege to bar production of a document pursuant to a subpoena, therefore, it follows that the document cannot be had pursuant to a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.633" offset="18417812">And he assumes that he could have barred the production of these documents in this case by, if they have been sought by a subpoena duces tecum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.121" offset="18451771">I will assume the premise, but the conclusion that he reaches from that does not follow because he has failed to take into account the reason why the Fifth Amendment is implicated when a subpoena duces tecum is issued to an accused or to a suspect in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.574" offset="18521570">The Court said in United States v. White, it repeated again in Couch, said it again in Bellis recently that the Fifth Amendment privilege is designed to prevent the use of or to prevent the use of legal process “to force an accused to produce and authenticate any personal documents or effects that might incriminate him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.034" offset="18611432">As far as the subpoena is concerned, the Court has not drawn a distinction between documents on the one hand or effects on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.456" offset="18637136">The Fourth Amendment certainly does not draw such a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.684" offset="18646018">It talks of persons, homes, of papers and effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.677" offset="18665975">All the items are on an equal plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.557" offset="18677574">So if petitioner’s argument were accepted, arguably it may mean and since the Government may not be able to subpoena even tangible items like a gun or the bag in which weapons were carried, therefore, it could not validly search for such items.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.761" offset="18738387">And I think the history of this Court’s decisions under the Fourth Amendment is enough to refute that contention, but that brings me to what I think is the critical point, what the Government thinks is the critical point in this case, that is when a subpoena duces tecum is issued to an accused, it forces him to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.494" offset="18821247">When a search warrant is issued, there is no such compulsion to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.499" offset="18845280">In the forced response from the subpoena duces tecum, the Court has found implicit testimony that is that the item demanded is the item produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.880" offset="18890837">If you look at a subpoena and the Federal Rules are set out, the subpoena says, you are hereby commanded, that sounds very much like compulsion and the command is directed to the person that receives the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.471" offset="18941201">A similar language in the search warrant, you are hereby commanded, but the command goes not to the person who is subject to the search, it goes to the person, the officer of the law who executes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.122" offset="18983833">As far as the person subject to the search is concerned, his only -- the only restrain on him is to stand aside to let the search proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.383" offset="19020823">He is compelled to do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.846" offset="19026674">Although, that is rather ambiguous phrase, but in those circumstances it seems odd as an initial matter that the Fifth Amendment would be violated by telling someone to stand aside. You are thereby compelling him to be a witness against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.042" offset="19083516">Now, petitioner’s argued and Boyd itself seems to say throughout, and I think what is left after this and I will address Boyd in a moment, the dictum in Boyd, is really a generalized claim of privacy that, well, petitioner ought to be allowed to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege because after all, his privacy would be invaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.284" offset="19168467">We think, properly understood, privacy is not involved in this case at all, at least as far as the Fifth Amendment is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.957" offset="19199187">The rule, the general rule, I think the Court has referred to it as the Ancient Rule, is just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.164" offset="19223951">In a criminal case, the public has the right to every man’s evidence, whether that evidence is private so long as it is related to the question before the Court or before the Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.986" offset="19271285">The rule applies to newsman, the Court so held in Branzburg v. Hayes, it even applies to the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.373" offset="19300855">The framers of the Constitution, if they designed the Fifth Amendment to protect privacy committed an incredible blunder because if they designed it to protect the privacy of the citizens of this country, they left out all the innocent people here who could never claim the Fifth Amendment or that they would be incriminated by producing a document.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.146" offset="19387895">I think what I have just said has been repeated by the Court recently in a footnote, in Nobles, in the Nobles case, footnote 7 specifically, where the Court quotes Mr. Justice White concurring in United States v. Mara, I think it was where Mr. Justice White said the purpose of the relevant part of the Fifth Amendment is to prevent self-incrimination not to protect private information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.961" offset="19491131">Now, as far as Boyd is concerned, there is dictum to be sure that seems to point in the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.096" offset="19511716">The Court could find no difference between on the one hand a search for evidence and compelling a man to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.286" offset="19540450">But the premises on which Boyd rested we think are undercut and have been undercut for quite sometime in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.505" offset="19565319">First of all, one premise, there are four basic premises for that statement in Boyd, the first is that a search and seizure of mere evidence is not permitted, Warden v. Hayden overruled that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.343" offset="19608682">The second is that a subpoena duces tecum which was the fact situation of Boyd is the equivalent of search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.575" offset="19641596">Since Oklahoma Publishing Company v. Walling, the Court has not followed that doctrine, they are not equated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.575" offset="19665629">The third resting point of Boyd is the one I have already mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.296" offset="19680467">That evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment violates the Fifth Amendment privilege if introduced, an exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.487" offset="19705231">I think that decisions of this Court for Mapp versus Ohio on recognized the exclusionary rule rests on the Constitutional basis on the Fourth Amendment only.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.460" offset="19741175">And finally, the final point of Boyd is that compelling a person to final premise of Boyd is that compelling a person to be the source of incriminating evidence violates his Fifth Amendment Privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.177" offset="19792062">That was rejected in Schmerber which involved the taking of a blood sample from an individual under compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.833" offset="19818602">That was rejected in Wade, which involved the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.709" offset="19830096">It was rejected I think in Dionisio which involved the voice exemplar, and it was rejected in Mara.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.584" offset="19853606">So, they are four basic pillars to the foundation of Boyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.971" offset="19875236">One, the search and seizure of mere evidence; two, the subpoena is equal to a search; three, evidence seized in violation of the Fourth violates the Fifth exclusionary rule, and four, compelling a person to be the source of incriminating evidence violates his Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.635" offset="19929884">Not a single one of those doctrines stands anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.681" offset="19938034">We think, therefore that what was only dictum in just a few lines in the Boyd opinion is no longer a good law and should not be followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5079.472" offset="20421195">Gilbert used the language as to relating to a hand writing exemplar that in contrast to the content of what is written, like the voice or body itself is only an identifying characteristic and Schmerber on the same rationale -- Mapp did not reject the Fifth Amendment holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.023" offset="20499353">I do not have a definite citation in front of me.</text>

            <text syncTime="5115.671" offset="20566018">In Dallas, Boyd has been reiterated by the words of Justice Marshall and quoting from Boyd, “it has long been established that the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self incrimination protects an individual from compelled production of his personal papers and effects as well as compelled oral testimony.”</text>
