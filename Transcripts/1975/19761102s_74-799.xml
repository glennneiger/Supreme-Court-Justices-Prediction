            <text syncTime="10.135" offset="115082">This case is here by way of the grant of a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.974" offset="146533">Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended provides that a net operating loss experienced by a corporate tax payer in one year may be carried as a deduction to the preceding three years and the succeeding five years to offset a taxable income of those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.069" offset="230856">The entire loss must be carried to the earliest possible year, and any of the loss that is not absorbed by that fi'</text>
            <text syncTime="61.728" offset="321553">dent had had ordinary income of about $7,000.00 and capital gain of about $167,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.529" offset="364708">The question presented is whether a loss carryover is absorbed by capital gain as well as ordinary income, or is instead limited to offsetting only ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.719" offset="417475">The taxpayer, the Foster Lumber Company filed a refund suit on the Federal District Court challenging the Commissioner's disallowance of its claim that the $35,000.00 of the 1968 loss not used or set is a 1966 ordinary income survived to reduce its 1967 tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.218" offset="503470">The trial court of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit agreed with the tax payer and re-granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict on a recurring question of a statutory interpretation in a field of law into the Internal Revenue Code of Continuing Importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.005" offset="582569">As even this short statement of the case makes evident, the issues to be decided involved complicated provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that do not lend themselves to intelligible oral discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.225" offset="643486">Suffice it to say that for the reasons spelled out in some detail and a written opinion filed with the clerk today, we have concluded that the Government is correct in its interpretation of the Code in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.662" offset="693224">Accordingly, the judgment before us is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.852" offset="705971">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion.</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="163.841" stopTime="446.410">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="163.841" offset="730004">I have filed a dissent in this case and that dissent is joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Brennan, and Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.615" offset="773054">This case was argued twice and it is now decided here by a vie before vote on the theory that a net operating loss incurred by the taxpayer and allowed under the statutes to be carried back was absorbed and I put that word in quotes or to use the Government's term completely absorbed by a capital gain in the carry back year, even though the loss could not be set off against that gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.072" offset="930833">There are two policies at work here, both of them favor the taxpayer, neither of them favors the Government and yet the Court by and now a margin comes out in favor of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.422" offset="980257">The first policy is the Congressional Policy of separating the taxation of capital gains on the one hand and the taxation of ordinary income, that the policy of course in to encourage investment and the formation of capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.074" offset="1058938">I feel that the Court's opinion today serves to put capital gain and ordinary income together and thus, to defeat this Congressional Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.007" offset="1118602">The second policy is the very existence of the carry back and carryover provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.729" offset="1153501">Its purpose of course is ameliorate the effect of spasmatic income to eliminate the peaks and valleys of income at a corporation or an individual for that matter maybe experienced because of our system of reporting and paying taxes on an annual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.889" offset="1262171">I think this policy is also defeated when the taxpayer over the period in question is taxed on more than his economic gain realized during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.774" offset="1317655">This is illustrated by the fact that have the capital gain in 1966 been sustained in 1967, there would be no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.997" offset="1354540">Similarly, if the net ordinary income of 1967 had been sustained in 1966, there would be no problem, but because there was a capital gain, this taxpayer by pure happen snaps, losses the benefit of both policies that Congress has undertaken to effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.594" offset="1448998">The Court I think also ignores and rides Russia out over an unbroken line of decisions elsewhere originating in a tax court and participated in, in successive cases by recognized judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.987" offset="1510543">This, as the Court had just stated orally, is a very complicated and detailed area of the law and if ever there is a place where the expertise of a tax court should be given difference, it is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.368" offset="1580028">The same thing is true with the decisions in the District Courts and then the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.959" offset="1606464">This is another illustration where the Government by its persistence and its power in tax matters, and lose in one Court of Appeals and lose in the second Court of Appeals, and lose in the third Court of Appeals, but finally go to a fourth and pick the divided decision, create a conflict, and the case brought here and we have a five to four decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.298" offset="1695803">I disagree emphatically with the Court's statement that the law here is clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.539" offset="1728717">The very fact that so many able judges in the tax court and in the District Courts and in the Courts of Appeals decided the other way, I think against the light of that time of reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.633" offset="1789113">It has been said that taxation is a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.712" offset="1805413">I think we ignore the light's precept of those words in this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.615" offset="1833103">The result for me is a distressing one and I think it is totally wrong and therefore I intercept it.</text>
