            <text syncTime="139.124" offset="659765">The matter was brought to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit where a 2:1 carrying panel decision was in the respondent’s favor and it was reheard en banc and affirmed by an equally divided Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.236" offset="1708216">Nonetheless, I think Judge Winter’s opinion is very persuasive simply because of Judge Winter’s reasoning and I think that it should be regarded by the Court as being correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.413" offset="1764954">The ordinance in question, it is very brief and I thought I would read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.418" offset="1785016">A permanent employee whose work is not satisfactory over a period of time shall be notified in what way his work is deficient and what he must do if the work is to be satisfactory.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.668" offset="1945930">And, next, we think it is very clear that this ordinance establishes certain prerequisites to dismiss procedural prerequisites.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.912" offset="1982919">One, that there must be a notification of the deficiency and, two, a continuance of the performance in a deficient manner and, three, a statement of explanation.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.126" offset="2223768">Why we feel that the very minimal procedures set forth in Section 6 are not binding in the determination of the substantive rights that are created by that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.099" offset="2267654">I feel that, at least the six justices of this Court in the Arnett case would so hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.002" offset="2307360">Now, the respondent concedes at page 10 in their brief that the ordinance is mandatory as to notification.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.915" offset="2439017">On page 10, first sentence, “although the ordinance is mandatory with respect to notifying employees of areas of deficient performance, it is merely permissive as to their dismissal for failure to perform.”</text>
            <text syncTime="598.054" offset="2495546">So, the mandatory provision conceded by the respondents is that requiring the pre-discharge notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.789" offset="2534417">In other words, the notice that must be followed by an opportunity to reform and demand one’s conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.331" offset="2568585">The District Court assumed, on 15 of the certiorari petition opinion, that the ordinance had been fully complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.102" offset="2603693">Of course, we think that assumption is manifestly incorrect for reasons which we will state in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.595" offset="2633682">But once it is established by the concession made by the respondents and by the assumption of the District Court that it is necessary to comply with certain procedures before terminating a public employee’s employment then we think the property rights are confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.153" offset="2715915">The property rights that bring due process considerations into play are confirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.108" offset="2743710">We have an alternative argument which I will rely upon the briefs and will not take the Court’s time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.958" offset="5147184">Well, do you think that stands under Arnett.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.599" offset="5165679">According to Your Honor’s opinion, six members of the Arnett Court and I suppose five members of this Court would hold that once the property or liberty interest is defined by state law that the procedural requirements are constitutionally defined and are not defined by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.350" offset="5276751">That is my reading of the opinions in Arnett, and we feel quite strongly that this is so that while state law, of course, creates certain rights, it is the Fourteenth Amendment, Due Process Clause that determines how these rights will be adjudicated and how they will be determined in the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.934" offset="5363060">So, we say that the full range of rights from Goldberg versus Kelly and other cases, in other words, a trial type hearing is what is required once the liberty and property interest of constitutional magnitude are identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.315" offset="5432546">The respondents have shown no pressing circumstances such as those present in a prison disciplinary situation or a public high school disciplinary situation that would require any truncating of the due process requirements or any shrinkage of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.724" offset="5506211">We think that there is ample time and proper place when an employee is to be deprived of a job to which he has a Fourteenth Amendment entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.328" offset="5544663">We think there is time and place for a due process hearing to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.510" offset="5565352">Clearly, this was not done in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.476" offset="5581235">Now, even if one were to look at the plurality opinion in Arnett and take the position that whatever source of the property interest at stake, that should also be the source for the procedural requirements even if one were to take that view, a view which I submit cannot be taken, still the respondents are deficient and were in violation of petitioner’s rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.008" offset="5715295">In the first place, he was never notified of any deficiency in his work, at least on summary judgment that must be taken because that was petitioner’s evidence, although it was in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.473" offset="5761166">Secondly, the written statement did not contain the true reasons for discharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1803.881" offset="7318795">I am here in behalf of the City of Marion and its two officials who were sued in their representative capacities under the Civil Rights Act and under the amount in controversy statute 28USC1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.411" offset="7392983">The first assumption that I make is about the reply brief filed by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.193" offset="7424121">The petitioner has now conceded that the city cannot be reached under 42USC1983 and this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1869.226" offset="7580229">May it please the Court, Mr. Bishop, the petitioner in this case was hired as a policeman by the City of Marion in June of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.265" offset="7620353">At the time he was hired, there was no personnel ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.070" offset="7635608">This personnel ordinance that we are now talking about was adapted on April 4, 1970, some-10 months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.603" offset="7677718">The petitioner was discharged after having been employed for two years and ten months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.801" offset="7702482">He was discharged on March 31, 1972.</text>

            <text syncTime="2550.914" offset="10306995">We say that Mr. Bishop had no more than a subjective expectancy that he would continue to be employed and that that is not protected by a procedural due process of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
