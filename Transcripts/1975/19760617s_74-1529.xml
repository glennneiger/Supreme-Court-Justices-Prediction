            <text syncTime="16.612" offset="140021">As a result of a plea bargain, he plead guilty to a charge of second-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.554" offset="159874">Before entering his plea, he was not informed by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.119" offset="174085">The prosecutor, the New York State trial judge or his appointed council that an intent to cause death was an element of the offense of second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.027" offset="213686">For that reason in a collateral attack on his conviction, the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York held that his plea was not an intelligent and voluntary admission of guilt and therefore that his conviction did not satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.083" offset="285993">Accordingly, a writ of habeas corpus issued which means that he must be given an opportunity by the New York State Court to enter a new plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.415" offset="319326">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.717" offset="336462">We granted certiorari and for reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk, we now affirm that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.775" offset="364674">Mr. Justice white has filed a concurring opinion which joins the opinion of the court in which he is joined by Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.131" offset="410127">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice has joined.</text>
