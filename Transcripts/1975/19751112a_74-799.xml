            <text syncTime="36.962" offset="251121">The question presented in this case is whether the respondent can carry back a $42,000.00 net operating loss incurred in 1968, as an offset against its 1966 taxable income of $174,000.00, and after that offset, used $35,000.00 of that loss a second time against its 1967 taxable income.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.498" offset="565321">We submit that no part of the $42,000.00 loss remains for offset against 1967 income, the facts are stipulated and relatively straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.887" offset="610879">In 1966, the taxpayer corporation had taxable income of a $174,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.038" offset="647450">In 1968, it incurred a net operating loss of $42,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.413" offset="668975">In accordance with Section 172 of the Code, the respondent carried back its loss, $42,000.00 loss to 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.571" offset="709622">Once that loss arrived back in 1966, the respondent had to re-compute its tax liability for its earlier year in 1966 as if that loss occurred in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.180" offset="764061">Now, it had to re-compute its tax liability pursuant to the code under two different methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.416" offset="789034">One is the so-called “regular method.”</text>
            <text syncTime="174.056" offset="799588">Section 11 provides for taxation of corporate income in accordance with prescribed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.094" offset="827695">Now, once having subtracted $42,000.00 from $174,000.00, it arrived at the recomputed taxable income of $132,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.365" offset="876805">If the tax on that, on the regular -- according to the regular method was $58,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.424" offset="905018">It then engaged in an alternative tax computation, which was provided for corporations pursuant to Section 1201 (a) of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.561" offset="941589">That alternative computation, it is permitted for corporations, which have net long -- net long-term capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.226" offset="984221">Now, its computation is set forth in our brief at, the various computations at page four, the Court will see that under the alternative method, the respondent subtracted its $42,000.00 loss from its $174,000.00 of taxable income and again had recomputed taxable income of approximately $132,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.866" offset="1094771">It then had engaged in the two-step computation pursuant to the alternative tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.470" offset="1117236">It subtracted its capital gain, well, essentially for short-term -- for shorthand purposes we call, its long-term capital gains, its partial tax-base was zero or negative amount and then it added it to that a flat 25% tax on its capital gains, the tax under that method, “alternative method,” was $41,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.176" offset="1215979">Now, pursuant to the code, the taxpayer, the prescribed tax is the lower amount that is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.935" offset="1243042">Now, this suit involves the year 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.920" offset="1259029">All the computations I have described thus far were applicable to year 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.638" offset="1285883">The respondent filed a refund claim for that year and that is the year it sued, asserting that even though its $42,000.00 loss, it was 1968, had been subtracted from its taxable income of $174,000.00 to yield a recomputed taxable income figure of a $132,000.00, it claimed that $35,000.00 of that loss was still available to offset its taxable income in 1967 which amounted to about $229,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.122" offset="1427780">Now, the District Court upheld the respondent’s claim and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.416" offset="1452962">In so holding however, the Eight Circuit acknowledged that its decision was contrary to the applicable Treasury Regulations, which were adopted shortly after the 1954 codification.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.392" offset="1500923">In this connection, has the Government’s position on this issue always been what it is today?</text>

            <text syncTime="354.236" offset="1520254">I think so Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.734" offset="1526210">It is my impression that the Government’s position has uniformly been in accordance with the position we urge here and I might add also that the commentaries shortly after the 1954 coder in the late 50s and early 60s prior to the Tax Court’s Chartier decision, were uniformly in support of the Government’s reading of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.589" offset="1629654">Now, at the time of the Eight Circuit’s decision in this case, there were two circuits, which had rejected our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.670" offset="1654001">However, they were briefed per curiam affirmances.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.365" offset="1668734">In fact, the First Circuit in dismissing the Government’s appeal, I mean, affirming and dismissing the Government’s position, just characterized the position as unimportant and seldom occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.834" offset="1726621">The Eight Circuit here frankly acknowledged that it was influenced by the cumulative weight of these two adverse Circuit decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.763" offset="1830379">In which the United States District Court relied upon the Tax Court and was affirmed per curiam by Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.384" offset="1856815">Now, shortly after within about three months of this decision, the Fourth Circuit issued what we believe is a well considered and comprehensive opinion in the Mutual Assurance Society of Virginia Corporation case, in which the Government’s position was squarely upheld as conforming with the statutory definition of taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.220" offset="1944169">Shortly after that, the Sixth Circuit in the Axelrod case rejected an individual taxpayer's similar attempt to cumulate and pyramid the benefits of both the net operating loss carried back provisions and the alternative tax computations.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.976" offset="2015222">We submit a resolution of this issue depends upon a careful analysis of the applicable statute, which is Section 172 of the 1954 code, specifically Subsection (b) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="493.195" offset="2076139">The pertinent part of that statute is set forth in our brief at the top of page 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.404" offset="2104979">It provides, “the portion of such loss, which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years, shall be the excess if any of the amount of such loss, over the sum of the taxable income for each of the prior years to which such loss may be carried.”</text>
            <text syncTime="519.850" offset="2182719">Now, the term “taxable income” in the statute is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.938" offset="2199124">That is a technical term, which is elsewhere defined in the code in Section 63 (a), and taxable income in accordance with this definition means gross income minus the deductions allowed by this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.774" offset="2266415">Now, here the 19 -- taxpayer’s 1966 taxable income was indisputably a $174,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.648" offset="2309883">Its 1968 loss $68,000.00 -- it was $42,000.00. Carrying back the $42,000.00 loss to the $174,000.00 of taxable income, as the statute prescribes, in our view demonstrates that there was no statutory excess of a loss over taxable income, which the taxpayer could then use for a succeeding year.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.521" offset="2433390">Now, the Eight Circuit in this case, in grappling with this admittedly technical problem, said it is impossible to find any plain meaning in the statutory language that would dispose of this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.665" offset="2497965">The Court then engage in what we think is an erroneous groping for policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.678" offset="2526072">We think the statutory language is absolutely plain and admits of no other rational interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.938" offset="2555121">The statute prescribes that the loss be netted against taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.361" offset="2572779">Here the taxable income was $174,000.00, the loss was $42,000.00, there is no excess to carry forward to the year 1967.</text>

            <text syncTime="1434.053" offset="5839548">The Court by its questions has indicated that it understands the Government’s real position in terms of the consequences of its position, and that is to repeat, that under the special circumstances of this case, the net operating loss of the taxpayer is to be wasted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.699" offset="5954069">Put in numbers, this means that that part of the capital gain we received in 1966, which absorbed the loss, is really taxed at a 73% rate in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.408" offset="6024913">25% for an alternative tax, 48% by reason of the failure to allow us to carry it against ordinary income of another year, disregarding surtax exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.463" offset="6089174">And today with the alternative tax rate on corporation at 30%, instead of the 25% which existed in the late 60s, that rate -- that total effective rate would be 78%.</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.975" offset="6371192">Here is where the Eight Circuit below agreed with the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.192" offset="6384045">It said either reading of the -- of this sentence is plausible, to use its exact words, this phrase could modify taxable income or it could modify the years, the earlier taxable years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.666" offset="6586023">Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun, the Tax Court first ruled in 1969, since then it has a couple of more cases, involving the same question, and as late as last year it said, “we remain convinced of the soundness of the Chartier decision.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.444" offset="6657076">That decision did take on, unlike almost any other case we have, did take on both prongs of this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.582" offset="6705664">The taxpayer is first asked to carry back his loss and take it against the capital gain, thus raising problem, which was raised by Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.185" offset="6760103">Could he take it against the capital gain?</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.434" offset="6773060">The Tax Court examined the alternative tax provisions very clearly and said it is unmistakable, you cannot do it, Congress has just said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.700" offset="6814125">So no, the answer is no, you cannot take it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.138" offset="6823842">The taxpayer’s alternative was I should like to carry the loss over to the next year since I could not use it in the capital gain here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.317" offset="6864593">The Tax Court here turned to the loss provisions of the code and found under the sentence that we were discussing, that he could carry the loss on to the next year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.819" offset="6914644">So the Tax Court had both -- both things before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.173" offset="6936064">It upheld its wild option that it cannot reduce the capital gain, but it allowed the carry over to the next year and did not therefore require the taxpayer to waste his net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.431" offset="6997086">Now, the unusual feature of the Government’s position in this case is that the Government will readily concede to this Court, that a capital gain in some of the eight possible carry years will not affect the matter at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.098" offset="7079738">In a few cases like ours, where the capital gain comes early in the carry period, then we are required under the Government’s position to waste our loss, but if the capital gain is delayed far enough in this total eight-year period, so that ordinary income can accumulate to absorb the loss, then the taxpayer gets both, the use of his loss and the favorable capital gains rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.976" offset="7199274">So, it is a matter of timing within the carry period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.580" offset="7217664">This matter of, and when I say a matter of timing, I am talking about timing within the eight possible carry years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.797" offset="7258520">The discrimination between taxpayers within that period under the Government’s position is based on no policy whatever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1853.018" offset="7515356">As you say, we cannot carry a loss back more than three-years, or we cannot carry it over more than five-years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.480" offset="7545240">The reason we have stressed this, as the Courts below did is, if the Court finds there is an ambiguity in this language and it is not quite clear what Congress was doing, then it is in order for the Court to look to the consequences in order to select between competing interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.023" offset="7639385">Foster, to continue this line of thought for one moment more, Foster must in this ambiguous area waste its net operating loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.531" offset="7693406">But if it has a competitor across the street, identical in every respect to it, except one and that is that its capital loss came one year later, two years before the net operating loss, that competitor gets the capital gain rate, gets to use its net operating loss, but under the Government’s position we do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.966" offset="7791209">Again, Mr. Justice Stewart, if this is commanded by Congress, we have to live with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.932" offset="7827049">We have tried to assist the Court on this very point by including in our brief at page 25, a table which shows the consequences of the Government’s position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.895" offset="7878876">Now, this is not a table with assumed specific dollars in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.648" offset="7893922">It is just a plain statement of what happens to a net operating loss when it encounters a capital gain in each of the eight carry years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.121" offset="7943764">And it states the government what happens under the government’s position and what happens under our position, and therefore, we hope effectively, points up the point we are trying to make in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.477" offset="8033207">We should say something because this is our opportunity to reply to the Government’s reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.708" offset="8066121">Mr. Justice Powell mentioned a moment ago that the -- that the amount the Government proposes to tax us on in the period is $396,000.00, instead of the $361,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.030" offset="8151490">The Government strenuously contests this point in its reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.118" offset="8183777">At page eight, they say and I read from the Government’s reply brief at page eight, “respondent and the amicus further argue that the Government’s position with tax respondent on a total of $396,000.00 for the three-year period ’66–’68, although respondent’s aggregate income for the period was $361,000.00.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.150" offset="8303940">A careful analysis of the figures demonstrates that this statement is simply inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.891" offset="8334869">Our response is our statement is accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.857" offset="8358797">The Government’s error is plain in this regard and as pointed up by the statement on the next page, page nine, where the statement is made computing the tax, and it is underlined, on the same $132,000.00 of taxable income, but by the alternative method provided in Section 1201, produce the lower tax of $41,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.172" offset="8495992">As in the exchange with Mr. Justice White, I think it was brought out clearly to the Court that the alternative tax was on the total $167,000.00 of capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.906" offset="8570912">The Government in its point one and its reply brief says the statute is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.050" offset="8591496">Of course, if the statute is clear and the Congress commands us to do as the Government indicates, we lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.009" offset="8627336">We have felt that our ambiguity in the statute is demonstrated by the opinions of the lower court and that the consequences we have pointed out are important and should be considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.671" offset="8702046">The fact is that the Government is asking for such an unusual out of the ordinary result here that it had seemed to us that they should be able to point to some indication by Congress, that it knew, it was enacting the result, which they have asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.190" offset="8796087">The fact is that over the years, neither Congress has indicated that nor more importantly has the Internal Revenue Service indicated to Congress that it was taking an administrative position that would yield such a result as they ask for today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.589" offset="8873723">And this problem has been with us for a long enough time for a some kind of administrative position to have been communicated to Congress on this point, yet I think there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.006" offset="8943313">The Government in its reply brief and also this morning states, the taxpayer result would have been impossible under the 39 code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.416" offset="8992946">We do not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.814" offset="8998588">We think our result could have been possible under the 39 code for a couple of reasons if not more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.559" offset="9037563">Certainly the same policy factors were acting under the 39 code as are acting today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.351" offset="9064730">The Merrill case cited by the North River amicus brief, is a clear indication that the Courts could have easily reached our result under the 39 code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.042" offset="9111437">Second thing I would like to point out is the existence of the Treasury Regulation under the 39 code, which says, net operating loss is available except to the extent absorbed by the taxable income of earlier years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.272" offset="9200358">Now, the word “absorbed” surely has some overtone of usefully applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.571" offset="9233586">Congress would have been looking at that Regulation, we may assume, when it enacted the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, at which time, as the Government’s counsel has pointed out, this whole section was rewritten, lots more was done to it than merely add the phrase “to which the loss may be carried,” which has so emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.614" offset="9337762">It would be entirely within the realm of possibility for that phrase to have been added as a matter of clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.024" offset="9375379">Congress could have well felt or whatever draftsman was acting for Congress could have well felt, that he was simply continuing a computational rule which had there to fore existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.876" offset="9478823">Mr. Chief Justice, the respondent would ask this Court to affirm the judgment below and in effect the views of the Tax Court for the reasons that are presented in our brief and here this morning.</text>
