            <text syncTime="65.016" offset="363355">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.477" offset="377252">This is case is before you on our petition for certiorari to the Ninth Circuit, which reversed a judgment in favor of the petitioners, which had been entered on a motion for summary judgment by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.401" offset="428974">The action is one for trouble damages and injunctive relief for price discrimination brought by an association, a retail druggist, against drug manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.305" offset="480592">One of the classes of allegedly unlawful discriminatory sales are to non-profit hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.333" offset="516641">The petitioners pleaded, as a defense, the Nonprofit Institution Act, which exempts from the Robinson-Patman Act, all purchases of supplies for their own use by non-profit hospitals and certain other non-profit institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.171" offset="596053">It was the respondents’ theory which has never changed and has been stated in this Court that the exemption is limited as a matter law to purchases of drugs that are physically consumed on hospital premises, and therefore cannot be competitively supplied by retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.834" offset="686646">The District Court disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.915" offset="698976">It held it all drug users engaged in by the non-profit hospitals as shown by the record where the own use of the hospital and granted summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.408" offset="748922">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed as to the non-profit status of the thirteen general service hospitals whose affairs are before you today, but limited the exemption to inpatient and emergency room use.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.435" offset="813079">It agreed that all of the rejected drug uses by the non-profit hospitals serve the public and are proper hospital functions, that it held that in those cases the hospital was not the consumer and these drugs were purchased for its purchasers use instead of its own.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="197.289" offset="892491">But laying aside all of the others categories that are involved, when a hospital sells to a customer who walks in off the street, are they forming a hospital function or a drugstore function?</text>

            <text syncTime="214.563" offset="961559">This would depend upon the circumstances of a particular sale Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.637" offset="977859">There is no contention by the petitioners on one hand that a hospital can setup a retail drugstore and stock it with 13C (ph) merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.550" offset="1025506">On the other hand, when a customer comes in who, as a matter of need, emergency, or for some other reason, finds it inconvenient or retail drugstore is unavailable, we say that the hospital is performing a hospital function, even though in those cases there is no associated hospital service of a distinct kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.916" offset="1219022">In that case, it could still be a matter of convenience or a matter of extending hospital services or hospital has the pharmacy prescription and as a matter of convenience they will on occasion come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.710" offset="1266146">Most of the hospitals according to this record do not fill or refill take home prescriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.735" offset="1290284">There are three or four that will do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.385" offset="1356844">And it is read, it can be read broadly to include, I suppose, certainly the situation that the Chief Justice referred to, the hospital pharmacy selling to somebody who comes in off the street in an emergency or otherwise, because that is for the use of the hospital and the profit is for the use of the hospital.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.982" offset="1483276">There is an additional analysis which we think supports our position in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.030" offset="1523400">We think that when a hospital -- when a sick person gets a hospital drug and uses it, consumes it, which is all the drugs happen to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.634" offset="1573869">He is obviously using the drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.868" offset="1586826">That is what the drug is for, it is been prescribed for him to make him well, he is using it.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.104" offset="1607724">It is our position that when the hospital dispenses the drug to him as part of its institutional functions, it is also using the drug because that is all hospital use drugs for.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.660" offset="1777937">Because a hospital can define its function, it can say we are going into the retail pharmacy business as one of our functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.669" offset="1826003">I would say that this would be a very possible conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.574" offset="1865604">Now as the Court is aware the record shows that each hospital has a pharmacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.519" offset="1889428">It is an integrated department of the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.893" offset="1902907">It achieves net revenues and those net revenues are devoted to institutional purposes namely the financing of non-revenue producing departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.058" offset="1943554">The principle drug use is for dispensing to in-patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.577" offset="1965601">The record shows that some 90% or more of all of these hospital drug purchases are used that way and the dispute is over the remaining 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.707" offset="2006143">The bulk of this 10% is used in three established distributional practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.804" offset="2030594">The first is the take home drugs that we referred to before.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.995" offset="2051283">These are drugs that are prescribed by the doctor in amounts that are determined by the doctor and they are regarded as a continuation of the hospitals medication.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.887" offset="2102901">Probably the most hotly debated area before this Court is a net of outpatient care.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.214" offset="2136233">Outpatients fall into two classes according to this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.464" offset="2157235">There are the traditional outpatient clinics of which there are half a dozen important associated with the hospitals as a hospital function which cater primarily to the poor.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.378" offset="2364857">The importance of outpatient care is not however limited to the clinics that conventionally have served the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.237" offset="2416266">As I think is apparent from the American Hospital Association brief, which I will not repeat, this is a rapidly expanding area of hospital service.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.715" offset="2462241">It is one which promotes the public interest by reducing hospital cost and reducing the incidents of inpatient care by emphasizing the incidents of outpatient care.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.626" offset="2517830">Then the third primary category that was excluded is staff sales, the pharmacy privilege which is accorded by the hospitals to those who work for them and those who practice medicine in association with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.497" offset="2577284">This is regarded by the institutions as a benefit to the institution something that promotes its operations, it is an important employee fringe benefit, it is negotiated for in some of the collective bargaining agreements that the institutions have and it is a subject of the fliers and publicity that they give their employees when they come to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1907.593" offset="7733751">First I would like to answer Judge Powell’s question that he just presented as to the ratio of refills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.197" offset="7756112">There is any record evidence that in so far as Kaiser is concerned the ratio was approximately 40%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.221" offset="7784220">Now the other hospitals do not assign a new number to a refill and for this reason it is difficult to know and there records are incomplete they sometimes will assign a letter after the number, but we think it is substantially larger than the defendants so far have conceded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1959.520" offset="7941373">It is true as you point up that the Night Circuit did send that back for a reexamination insofar as Kaiser, but the matter of developing this clinics which are considerably removed incidentally in the case of Kaiser, some of them are up to 10 and 12 miles away from the hospital, will be the way in which they are definitely trending the goal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.875" offset="12830868">Yes, Your Honor, it is certainly correct that that effect also took place, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.071" offset="12855632">But Congress certainly felt it was serving a function in passing 13c.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.658" offset="12877993">Well, Congress felt it was illegal at that point, and the Senate Committee said so, and so did the, as manufacture said it had now made it illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.349" offset="12904742">So, this change was brought about by 13c, and it clarified the situation of the in hospital use as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.664" offset="12930029">So that there is -- I concede it, and in light of the case law now I would concede that probably, even then, perhaps, it was unnecessary if the case law had developed to the point that it now had, but that was something that Congress was not in the position to forecast accurately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.175" offset="13000037">Now, again, why I return to the words of the stature which I think, basically, is what we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.228" offset="13020204">The word “supplies” also means something other than resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.823" offset="13042669">A supply wagon in the days of old vestment supplies went through a particular fort or a particular city or something of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.537" offset="13069523">It did not mean the things that were going to be sold in a vendor’s cart from door to door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.134" offset="13091884">These are not supplies, and “use” means -- and certainly under all of the use taxes in every sate I can think of, that at the point something is resold and of course, this is the Astro (ph) case, which this court decided in 1882, when you talked about a resale, that is no longer a “use”, it is simply supplying something to be used by somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.779" offset="13178401">And when Congress stressed the word “their” twice, their supplies, and I noticed this seems to be dropped occasionally, from the petitioner’s brief, “their supplies for their own use”, that word “their” used twice, certainly, meant the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.879" offset="13242871">It did not mean the private consumption of somebody off the premises having no connection with the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.589" offset="13265650">And particularly, when they went to Congress and said, “We needed to take care of the needy sick”, with any institution.</text>
