            <text syncTime="57.025" offset="331378">I am Joel Westbrook of San Antonio, Texas, representing the appellant, American Motorist.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.081" offset="363665">We are aware, may I please the Court that not very many constitutional venue of questions come to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.471" offset="401177">But I must say I must pass on you that it has been said that Texas probably has a furnished own appellate system, more venue appealed and all the other 49 jurisdictions combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.746" offset="462303">And I believe this case will help you see why that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.552" offset="481530">Because in Texas the venue cared a great deal more encumbrance than just where the case is going to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.299" offset="532521">Our client, the American Motorists, unsuccessfully challenged venue in this -- on issue of Motorists case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.768" offset="578392">That brought against it in a Texas State District Court in McLennan County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.120" offset="603783">The appellate then had no more success in the Appellate Court of Texas because the Texas Supreme Court had previously, in 1963 in its Commercial Insurance versus Adam’s case against virtually the same constitutional challenge and held against the challenge, and virtually the same one that we are making today.</text>
