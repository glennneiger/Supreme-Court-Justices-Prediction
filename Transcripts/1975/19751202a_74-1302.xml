            <label>Mr. R. R. McMahan</label>
            <text syncTime="37.008" offset="251335">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.571" offset="265650">The issue raised by these cross-appeals is one of the constitutional rationality of the means that Congress has chosen to achieve, clearly, the legitimate purposes of the Black Lung Benefits provisions of the Coalmine Health and Safety Act of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.431" offset="353003">The Coalmine Health and Safety Act, as counsel for the government no doubt will point out to you at much greater length, was originally conceived and enacted to redress some very real grievances among mineworkers.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.599" offset="425728">It was designed at its original conception to deal with health and safety aspects of mining, to control dust levels, to prevent accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.009" offset="479331">Later, toward the end of congressional consideration of the legislation, provisions were inserted for providing economic relief to disabled retired coalminers, principally in the southern United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.789" offset="562505">Then at the very end of the consideration of the Act, provisions were inserted to create a Workman’s Compensation Program, a fairly elaborate three-part program, third part of which would impose liability on former and present employers of retired and active coal mine workers suffering from occupational disease, a single occupational disease known as Coal Worker’s Pneumoconiosis, a disease which is caused by breathing dust.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.856" offset="706701">The disease actually is a physiological condition that develops from breathing dust at certain levels in certain concentrations over given periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.554" offset="757588">The more dust that is breathed, the longer it is breathed, the more likely it is that the disease will develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.610" offset="801787">This appeal arouse out of a suit brought by 22 mine operators in the Eastern District of Kentucky to enjoin the enforcement of the legislation, the Workman’s Compensation provisions of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.288" offset="856435">The Three-Judge Court in the Easter District upheld the major portions of the law against plaintiff's attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.242" offset="896246">Plaintiffs challenged to their validity under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.212" offset="928219">The Court, however, did strike down two presumptive provisions that were included in the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.887" offset="958835">I will describe those in greater detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.266" offset="968344">That is why these cases are before the Court now on cross-appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.676" offset="998019">The act benefits provisions of the Act, which is all that we are concerned with here today, create a three-part program, the first part ending in the end of June of 1973, under which former President of Coal mine employees could apply for benefits which will be paid by the federal government through the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare administered by the Social Security Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.711" offset="1138139">The six months following the end of that program, which will be referred to here, frequently, as the Part B Program, involved a dual administration of claims for benefits to be carried out by the Department of Labor and HEW jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.968" offset="1207207">The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare establishing the benefits of the diagnostic criteria, the medical criteria, for determining whether a miner or former miner has the disabling occupational disease, the Act was designed to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.119" offset="1279828">Claimants filing within that time would be paid by the government for six months and, thereafter, by a former employer or present employer or a coal mine operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.245" offset="1332281">The crucial part of this legislation and the part that plaintiffs here consider constitutionally objectionable is Part C of the Act which imposes upon mine operators the former employers of former miners and the present employers of present miners the obligation to pay benefits in connection with this single occupational disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.729" offset="1474283">Plaintiffs maintain that to the extent that this portion of the Act indiscriminately imposes liability for the claims of former employers based upon employment periods that had terminated long prior to the enactment of the legislation, that it constitutes a completely irrational means for achieving what is admittedly the legitimate purpose of providing economic relief to a large population of elderly, retired, and ill coal miners and their survivors.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="383.371" stopTime="399.713">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="383.371" offset="1636765">Mr. McMahan, are you talking now about those who were employed by a particular mining operator and who are presumed to have contracted the disease during the period of that employment although their symptoms showed much later?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="r_r_mcmahan" startTime="399.713" stopTime="486.422">
            <label>Mr. R. R. McMahan</label>
            <text syncTime="399.713" offset="1702175">I am talking about all applicants for benefits payable by a former employer whose employment terminated prior to the enactment of the law that imposed this obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.386" offset="1772915">It must be recognized in this case that this is not a typical workman’s compensation law that imposes liability in respect of occupational disease that develops after an employment relationship is terminated when there has been a workman’s compensation law in effect during the employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.188" offset="1868105">There is no question that that is a rational legislative program because an employer, if he knows that the potential liability is there, can insure against it and then it does not make any difference if the work-related disability results following termination of the employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.998" offset="1951279">That is not the case here, what this law has been what Congress has done, has lost sight of the fact, that in attempting to accomplish two purposes here through the use of workmen's compensation type law, they have chosen a completely irrational means of delivering relief to former retired miners.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="486.422" stopTime="497.289">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="486.422" offset="2048977">Well, I do not see what is irrational about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.052" offset="2055560">Certainly, the retired miners are getting the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.759" offset="2070397">I take it your contention of irrational intents from who is based on the source of the money.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="r_r_mcmahan" startTime="497.289" stopTime="542.923">
            <label>Mr. R. R. McMahan</label>
            <text syncTime="497.289" offset="2092445">Yes, my contention and unless the Court is prepared to accept that the only question of rationality here is whether the money actually reaches the miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.260" offset="2140406">I think that the means has to be examined more carefully and we say that it is irrational to single out former employers to deliver what is really economic relief as a result of disability due to a disease which no one knew existed in the United States at the time these men were employed, and that has been recognized repeatedly in the legislative history of the Act as being a national obligation and recognized as being a moral obligation by the government.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="542.923" offset="2274988">You are just suggesting different ways Congress might have treated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.091" offset="2287736">Is it not our scope of inquiry extremely narrow here so that we would have to say, in effect, that Congress just lost its head when it passed the statute in order to hold it unconstitutional?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="r_r_mcmahan" startTime="559.279" stopTime="595.083">
            <label>Mr. R. R. McMahan</label>
            <text syncTime="559.279" offset="2340399">I think that the scope of the inquiry here is narrow but not as narrow as it would be in the case of more conventional economic regulatory legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.574" offset="2397659">I think that the means chosen by Congress to deliver relief to these former and retired miners in this instance, deserve a closer scrutiny because it involves a suspect imposition of new rights and obligations on transactions and on basis of conduct, what closed in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.731" offset="2490237">It is suspect because this Court has recognized that laws that have that effect are suspect, not necessarily unconstitutional but worthy of close examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.288" offset="2688455">In this area they merge, as the Court well knows, it is Due Process in the sense that, our contention is that a Workmen’s Compensation Law is an irrational means no matter on what basis it is analyzed.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.885" offset="2754910">It is an irrational means for delivering benefits to persons who were not in workforce at the time that the law was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="960.154" offset="3943899">Now, I will be frank that the legislative history here is voluminous and the question of whether there is any occupational disease arising out of the breathing of coal dust other than coal worker’s Pneumoconiosis was subject to dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1030.752" offset="4226335">Silicosis, as I understand it, is what is much broader form of physiological condition and coal worker’s Pneumoconiosis until the 50's in this country was thought to be silicosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.407" offset="4280984">There is a condition or conditions called the Pneumoconiosis which develop from breathing dust of various sorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.673" offset="4314002">Coal worker’s Pneumoconiosis is an expressly identifiable physiological condition arising out of the breathing of coal dust as opposed to flax dust or stone dust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.306" offset="4388504">The presumptions in this Act are deemed rebuttable for the most part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.530" offset="4425493">There is one that the lower Court struck down which creates a presumption of total disability from a complicated form of the disease, and the Court found that an irrational presumption because the Act expressly set up determination, required determination of the existence of the disease and the total disability from it as two separate factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.641" offset="4541895">I think the Court was clearly right in reaching that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.000" offset="4559344">I, however, think that the Court seriously misapplied the law and misunderstood the impact of these presumptions, of the rebuttable presumptions which are primarily responsible for the over inclusiveness of the diagnostic criteria that the Department of Labor is forced to apply in its adjudication of claims and it results in many, many people, we believe, being paid compensation for diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema which exists in 25% of the general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.067" offset="4743560">There were 6% of the social security disability benefits to the general public are payable with respect to respirable diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.621" offset="4789849">It was believed by the Public Health Service, by the government, that when this Act was first enacted that there would only be about 53,000 beneficiaries and that that would cost the government about $120 million a year and, to this point, there have now been 500,000 people found eligible for benefits and it is costing $1 billion annually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.809" offset="4898518">We do not believe that this is a paradox resulting from an epidemic of the disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.752" offset="4934358">I think it results purely from the inclusion of great numbers of people in the benefits eligibility criteria who simply were not made ill by coal mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.766" offset="4990365">Now, this Court has struggled in recent years with how to treat presumptions and especially irrebuttable presumptions and especially implicit presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.235" offset="5052223">We really do not have that problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.402" offset="5064970">These are plain evidentiary presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.446" offset="5077091">The question is, is there a rational connection between the fact to be proved to establish the fact to be presumed, and is that presumption, the fact presumed fairly rebuttable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.219" offset="5140203">We claim that it is not fairly rebuttable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.462" offset="5149189">That they are not fairly rebuttable in this case because the Congress has written in to the legislation limitations on rebuttal which make it impossible to distinguish non-work-related respirable diseases from this single work-related disease.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.955" offset="5219197">Mr. McMahan, what if Congress had said “because of the difficult of distinguishing between all of these diseases, any former coal miner who comes up with any sort of a respiratory disease is going to have to be compensated by his former employer,” it might not be this coal mine Pneumoconiosis but there is some substantial chance that it might be, and we are going to resolve doubts in favor of the miner?</text>

            <text syncTime="1313.921" offset="5359005">I would agree with you completely that it would be within the power of Congress to pass a law saying that all coalminers, past or present, who have a respirable disease regardless of whether it is work-related should receive benefits, but I do not think it is within the authority of Congress to say that all such persons having such diseases should be paid by coal mine operators.</text>

            <text syncTime="1368.003" offset="5575299">Not necessarily because these people, let us say, were employed by the coalminers for a substantial period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.666" offset="5606019">There is medical evidence that shows that Pneumoconiosis does develop in people so employed and it is very hard to tell from other respiratory diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.397" offset="5640918">Now, you are resolving many doubts against the coalminers but I do not see how that makes it irrational.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.187" offset="5664115">There, you have changed the question somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.078" offset="5679684">You are saying if there is a possibility that their disease has developed out of coal mining, that that is sufficient to attach that liability through presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.962" offset="5723152">Now, I think that that is probably a reversal of what legislative presumptions have always been designed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.114" offset="5759828">Far more often, except in cases of intent or subjective indeterminable questions, presumptions are only appropriate when they are used to forego evidence of a fact that is clearly inferable and for administrative convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.203" offset="5828164">We would submit, in this case, that if the Court should only find that the evidence is 50-50 on whether any other respirable diseases are caused by coal mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.659" offset="5881976">That finding, in itself, should be sufficient to suggest that it is not appropriate for Congress to proceed by presumptions at all because there is no question, the government will admit that these same respirable diseases exist in non-mine employees, in the general population and, therefore, there is no way to determine actual causation and, in that case, it would seem sensible and it would not seem to impose this Court’s values on Congress at all to simply say this is a case where, instead of redefining a disease in a way that no doctor would accept absent the compulsion of law, simply say you will compensate for the occupational disease and those which may or may not be compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.870" offset="6082806">And then, we believe that if Congress is forced to do this it might examine more carefully the legislative means it chooses to achieve that in and, in so doing, might, we hope, discover that it is not rational to impose that liability on former employers of those people, that it might more rationally be imposed on industry and ultimately on the consumer of the product or that it might more rationally be paid out of public funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.668" offset="6290009">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.779" offset="6306414">This case brings before the Court issues for reexamination on plenary review which were decided last term in the Court’s summary affirmance of a Three-Judge Court decision in the District of Columbia, in a case called National Independent Coal Operators Association against Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.464" offset="6405157">The chief difference between the two cases is that in the National Independent Coal Operators Association case, the Three-Judge District Court exercised pendant jurisdiction over challenges to the implementing regulations of this Act, as well as the statutory challenges and upheld both the statutory provisions at issue and the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.090" offset="6527723">And that judgment was summarily affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.652" offset="6545904">The Three-Judge Court in the present case declined to exercise, pending jurisdiction over the challenge and the regulations.T</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.744" offset="6590313">He issues with respect to the regulations have been remitted to a single District Judge and are presently being litigated before him, and reached only the statutory issues and, for the most part, upheld the Act although, in two respects, it ruled that the Act was unconstitutional subsequent to this Court’s summary affirmance last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.836" offset="6686652">In a way, the case is reminiscent also of this Court’s decision last term in Weinberger against Salfi which we iterated and elaborated upon many of the governing principles which we think apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.734" offset="6754257">Congress was faced in this legislation with extensive medical and other evidence developed through a lengthy series of hearings, both in connection with the 1969 Act and in connection with the 1972 Amendments, which were concerned only with the compensation aspects of the program, with the problems of respiratory diseases among coalminers and, particularly, Pneumoconiosis which is a chronic disease, an irreversible disease which, in its later stages, becomes progressive and inevitably fatal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.766" offset="6950384">It is true that Congress first gave attention to these problems in the 1960s and found, at that time, the state workman’s compensation laws were grossly inadequate to take care of these problems, but the disease was not entirely unknown until that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.652" offset="7037947">It was first recognized in England and elsewhere in Europe in the 1930s that the hearings pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.642" offset="7069921">So, I do take exception to the statement that no coal mine operator could have known of these dangers for the miners and it came to be recognized in the medical profession in this country in the 1950s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.779" offset="7138466">Be that as it may, it was in the late 1960s and again in the early 70s that Congress attempted to find a legislative solution to these serious problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.779" offset="7206489">And in doing so, Congress was concerned, first of all, to strike a proper balance of the burden between the Federal Treasury, the industry, and the victims of this disease in attempting to provide for the very large backlog of cases that had not previously been provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.442" offset="7313068">We have summarized some of the results of the balance Congress struck on page 25 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.124" offset="7351834">The figures at the top and the hundreds of thousands are figures that have been brought in to the part of the program paid for entirely from the Federal Treasury with respect to the compensation claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.292" offset="7424455">352,000 of these claims have been approved out of the 550,000 applied for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.540" offset="7461444">Then you get down in the second paragraph on page 25 to the portion of the prospective burden largely which Congress thought fit to assigned to the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.483" offset="7525287">We are talking about 70,000 claims that have been filed thus far with an estimated yearly rate to come of 5,000-6,000 claims and, of the 70,000 claims filed, only 21.6% have been approved for payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.680" offset="7610028">The approvals are running at rates slightly above 20%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.005" offset="7631344">Many of them are claims that were already rejected under the federally financed portion of the program.Congress was solicitous toward the industry and particularly, as a result of the 1972 Amendments, set up the program so that it is doubtful if any truly retroactive claims will be made against any of the companies because of the three-year statute of limitations and the extension of the federally financed portion of the program to three-and-a-half years, followed then by a half-year transitional program partially financed by the Federal Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.134" offset="7831860">We have, on pages 30 and 31 of our brief, noted that retrospective aspects to legislation do not necessarily invalidate it, far from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.031" offset="7895495">There are numerous cases cited there and in footnote 29 of the brief in which the Court has upheld retrospective application of laws in appropriate circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2430.721" offset="9826257">Well, if it will turn to the presumptions now, Congress was faced with the problem under this Act of a disease that is difficult to prove and difficult to disprove and it wanted to set up what it thought would be a fair system of compromising between bringing more people into eligibility than an ideal system might bring, make eligible for the benefits if proof were easier and denying benefits those that it felt needed them that it wanted to help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.720" offset="9986231">And so, it set up a scheme which we have tried to summarize briefly on pages 37 and 38 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.627" offset="10037849">And, let me talk, first, about the evidentiary presumptions which are the ones that begin in the bottom of page 37, and the first thing to be said about them is I do not think that scheme of the Act was fully understood by the District Court and it is concerned about these presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.522" offset="10129382">It seem to overlook or fail to understand that Section 422c of the Act contains a proviso that is applicable to any claim for benefits against any operator, and that is on page 7a of the appendix to the consolidated brief of the plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.733" offset="10238260">That proviso says that no benefits shall be payable by any operator on account of death or total disability due to Pneumoconiosis which did not arise, at least in part, out of employment in a mine during the period when it was operated by such operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.406" offset="10304925">So that there is always the possibility of making a defense to any of these claims to begin with by showing that the conditions in your mind were such that Pneumoconiosis could not have been contracted by the claimant in your mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.400" offset="10380889">Second, the Court seemed to overlook that these evidentiary presumptions attach only after the elements that trigger them have been established in an administrative hearing in which the employer is free to participate and contest the existence of those elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.785" offset="10482453">So, we are not talking about failure of an opportunity for the employer to contest any of these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.867" offset="10514845">Now, the first of the presumptions applying, as we summarize it on page 38a there, a miner who has worked in the mines for 10 years or more and shows that he has contracted Pneumoconiosis, and that proof can be contested as to whether or not he actually has that disease, and that is the disease that is occupationally related only to work in the coal mines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3578.470" offset="14417225">Is it true, Mr. Wallace, that if Congress now said or had said in this legislation that beginning on that date in 1973, a tax of $2 per ton of every coal mine in the United States would be put into a fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="3600.825" offset="14506668">That would be a permissible legislative means of taking care of this problem, but I do think it should be recognized that there is nothing novel in workman’s compensation about presumptions. The ordinary rule in workman’s compensation is that if you can show the injury, it is presumed that it arose out of your employment and it is up to the employer to rebut that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.573" offset="14593604">And, in a way, the first of the evidentiary presumptions cuts back on that rule by saying that you have to show also that you were employed for 10 years in the coal mine in order for that presumption to come into force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.379" offset="14644804">In the ordinary workman’s compensation case, all you would have to show is that you had the injury and it would be presumed that it arose out of your employment unless that were rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.940" offset="14695064">There is nothing that novel about this scheme of compensating injured employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3663.799" offset="14758489">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.614" offset="14769774">I would only feel compelled to clear up a very dangerous and mistaken impression that counsel for the government has left you with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.444" offset="14833095">The Part C Program, to answer Mr. Justice Stewart’s question, is not just a compensation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.083" offset="14879697">Part C Program is a reparations program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.077" offset="14895684">This business about the three years statute of limitations is an illusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.873" offset="14918776">It is an illusion for substantial numbers of these former miners’ claims because the Act has redefined the disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.936" offset="14959109">Now that means, in effect, that a man could have had emphysema for 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.209" offset="14984187">He could have quit mining in the 40s.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.633" offset="14997875">He could have been diagnosed as having emphysema for 30 years, but he can come in and qualify for benefits under this Act because the three years run from discovery of the disease and, suddenly, his emphysema is diagnosed, under this Act, as coal worker’s Pneumoconiosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.472" offset="15073212">They have many, many claims against the 22 plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.624" offset="15089826">Some 80% so far are from people who have not worked in mining for years and years prior to the enactment of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.308" offset="15128592">This is not at all comparable to retrospective rating or adjusting your insurance rates from year to year even, if you happen to be one of the few operators in one of the few states that allows that kind of a compensation, and this is purely reparations and we believe that it is irrational that this legislation is an irrational way of delivering those reparations.</text>
