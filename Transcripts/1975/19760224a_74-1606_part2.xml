            <text syncTime="13.999" offset="159287">When we left off yesterday, I think there might have been some misunderstanding communication in answer to question that I had with Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.418" offset="200978">I had stated that under Federal Law with respect to Municipal, or with respect to Federal employees, Congress has declared the penalty to be automatic and that is discharge by Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.684" offset="266076">In a private sector, there is no penalty for striking, it is a protected activity and so while in the private sector, there is no penalty for striking, Congress has declared that for employees of a Federal government, there is an automatic penalty of discharge and it is a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.378" offset="348832">This is not the case in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.730" offset="362206">Wisconsin legislature has merely stated that strikes are prohibited and provided no penalty, except for those situations when the strikers continue on strike after a judicial order, ordering them back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.611" offset="441827">It is at that point only in Wisconsin that the legislature has created a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.422" offset="468995">In fact, under Wisconsin law, as far as striking teachers are concerned, there is no absolute right to an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.056" offset="511522">The Court, the Wisconsin Supreme Court interpreting Wisconsin law, has clearly indicated recently in cases cited in the brief --</text>

            <text syncTime="138.724" offset="658226">I am stating that that is the only statement made by the Wisconsin legislature on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.201" offset="680169">The Wisconsin Supreme Court said in this case, that in addition to those penalties, there could be disciplinary proceedings conducted by the employer, but that discharge is not an automatic penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.556" offset="737534">There can be a wide variety of discipline imposed for striking which is a completely different framework than that created by Congress in which the penalty is fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.198" offset="788107">Therefore, under Wisconsin law, there is discretion and judgment which must be used in the penalty phase of any proceeding involving a strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.552" offset="905553">No, the Wisconsin Supreme Court in my judgment as reading the whole package seems to be saying that even though the strike might be prohibited, there can be a mitigation of justification and the whole usual kind of oral mitigation as you get in any penalty phase of the proceedings, which takes it completely different as to whether it does not matter, whether they were unlawfully on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.450" offset="1037106">That does not mean they automatically discharge and that does not mean they automatically breached the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.527" offset="1057481">The concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Robert Hanson, viewed this case as a contract case and his opinion was that there would be no automatic recession.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.007" offset="1167405">The Wisconsin Supreme Court decided that the School Board was not a -- was not an unbiased body to make any decision at all and that is the issue, that is here.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.000" offset="1267297">I think that I am and that the reason there was a need for an impartial decision maker is because the issue is not just whether there was a strike in progress or whether these people had been on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.694" offset="1322154">Under Wisconsin law, these people, the school board must decide what a penalty should be and whether -- and it must under Wisconsin law determine a reasonable penalty, therefore, and that it almost is a classic due process syllogism.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.009" offset="1387356">The teachers have property interest and it is a dual property interest in this case because they have two contracts in effect.</text>
