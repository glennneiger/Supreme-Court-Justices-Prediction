            <text syncTime="242.908" offset="1074903">So we were talking about one out of ten of the publications.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.960" offset="1099145">I was just making that as a fact that he was not just recklessly laying everything out that it had been found obscene down in Mobile and said okay, now do what you want.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.239" offset="1388268">That of course, Section 6 on page 47 says, the provisions of this Act are cumulative and shall be in addition to any other laws that are enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.156" offset="1427974">Curiously enough, this case was decided May 9, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.188" offset="1444066">On May 9, 1974, the Alabama Supreme Court in a decision in other case said that notice provision was unconstitutional because that represented a prior restraint much like the Bantam Books and a decision of this Court in the bygone era.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.829" offset="5806619">And I say here, one of the things as we were -- he was not allowed to litigate this under the Birmingham Standard and of course, the right of confrontation Justice Huffman refers to was also denied counsel in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.340" offset="5876627">And the law in Alabama is clear that in a judgment in a civil suit cannot be admitted in a criminal prosecution arising at the same transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2897.333" offset="11692634">May it please the Court and just a few observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.988" offset="11699217">Number one, counsel said that it is clear under Alabama Law that the burden of proof is on the censor in the civil declaratory judgment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.897" offset="11734848">That was in 1972 that that decision was rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.391" offset="11744879">So, in 1970 that question was not as open in shut as it was in 1972 in the Koppel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.041" offset="11771419">We also point out, if the Court please that taking a page A(5) of my Appendix which is the majority -- part of the majority opinion of Justice Faulkner, first sentence of the first paragraph says neither McKinney nor the state introduced the evidence in the trial on the question of obscenity vel non.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.607" offset="11865773">McKinney raised that issue in a motion to quash the complaint which the trial judge overruled and in continuing to page A(7), Justice Faulkner says we now decide the question of whether the Mobile Circuit Court Decree was binding on McKinney since he was not a party to the action and since obscenity vel non was not permitted as an issue by the Trial Court and even Justice Huffman says on page A(9), thus there was no finding by the jury, the matter alleged to be obscene was obscene and indeed no such determination could have been made under the Trial Court’s charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.982" offset="12043197">So, and the last thing I would like to point out to the Court is that with Justice Brennan’s question regarding Carnal knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.397" offset="12080918">If Carnal knowledge was found obscene, the day before the decision of this Court in Jenkins in Mobile, Alabama and notice were given in Birmingham, Alabama to Mr. McKinney if he were a theater exhibitor, he could still be held accountable for having violated the crime of having displayed or exhibited material which had previously or judicially been declared obscene.</text>
