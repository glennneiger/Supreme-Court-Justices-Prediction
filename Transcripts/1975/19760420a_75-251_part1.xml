            <text syncTime="358.288" offset="1536437">In other words, the men did not get the benefits and they could not retire at the same age as women and that this not only of course violated Title VII, but seem to violate the EEOC Guidelines which were promulgated about two weeks after the 1972 Amendments and I think someone important to establish a bit of the chronology here, these of course were laws of the State of Connecticut which presumably should have been reevaluated by the state after the passage of the 1972 Amendments.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul W. Orth</label>
            <text syncTime="460.694" offset="1946037">Not in the appendix, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.404" offset="1960874">Basically there is no factual dispute anymore and that I think is the reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.244" offset="1984280">The State of Connecticut in effect spent two wasted years in terms of legislative action in which it did nothing to correct the discrimination that was apparent on the face of its laws and in October of 1974, excuse, September of 1974, the Distinct Court enjoined the state officials who were sued from continuing to administer the law in a fashion discriminatory against men.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.502" offset="2145299">The problem of course and the reason why we are here is in the process, the Court relying on the Eleventh Amendment in Edelman and Jordan denied a recalculation of retroactive retirement benefits which I am for shorthand referring to as back pay and also denied attorney’s fees and in that of course, we submit there is error in the Second Circuit said that the District Court was wrong as to attorney’s fees only and I will be addressing most of my argument to the back pay question.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.024" offset="2339441">I have I believe already mentioned that the '72 Amendments were adapted after extensive legislative hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.476" offset="2377161">There was a considerable background of discrimination in governmental employment, perhaps worst than in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.765" offset="2414360">There seems to be no question in language plus the intent of Congress that Congress intended to make a state employer subject to the same obligations as private employers and give state employees access to all the remedies under Title VII that an employee of private industry would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.171" offset="2511953">Now, the effective nullification by the decision of the Court below of the monetary remedial provisions of Title VII in the state context to me cannot be squared with two recent decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.623" offset="2589798">Foremost is the Albemarle versus Moody case about a year ago and then less than a month ago the case of Franks versus Bowman.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.035" offset="2631490">These cases demonstrate in various forms, two forms primarily, first back pay and then seniority, the importance to the enforcement of Title VII of the private remedy of back pay of seniority and that these remedies are part of a complex equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.470" offset="2769207">There is no cut off point in the remedial section of Title VII between monetary damages or cause of action from monetary damages on the one hand and an injunction which was obtained here on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.702" offset="2874115">As a matter of fact, the Albemarle case indicated that it would be inappropriate to open up any chasm between the injunctive and the monetary aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.381" offset="2936809">Now, having said that in the private context and Congress having found that discrimination in governmental employment was perhaps more institutionalized, worse than in private employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.293" offset="3020505">It seems that if the range of the equitable remedies available against states are cut down, that private suits to enforce state employees rights are likely to disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.136" offset="3099813">It is certainly apparent and it was Congress’ intent that private suits would be a prime means of enforcing the law and that the resources of the Attorney General were insufficient to take care of all these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.562" offset="3169508">Furthermore, it was apparent that Congress was relying as has had to be the case in the civil rights area for a Century, on the federal courts and it gave the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction and yet the Court below suggested that Congress could and both of this areas have done things differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.632" offset="3265847">In other words, that reliance could have been had on the Attorney General alone or that state courts might be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.890" offset="3306912">In stressing, as both Albemarle and the Franks cases have the equitable remedy, a remedy that is not like damages, not subject to jury trial, that is part of a complex to try to solve on a case by case basis as the lower court, the trial court seems fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.458" offset="3421119">The Congress has in effect solved a problem of federalism and I would suggest to the Court that in doing so, a couple of things have been accomplished, they are quite vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.488" offset="3501263">First of all, it is perhaps most appropriate that in this very difficult area of federalism, federal concern that Congress made up of the representatives of the various states is the most appropriate forum to determine what remedy rights and remedies there should be and of course here, Congress has spoken very clearly and in speaking very clearly and in giving the District Courts these full equitable powers not only to issue the injunction, but to order other affirmative relief etc.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.167" offset="3695927">as the recent decisions have pointed out, the Congress I submit has allowed the lower court to take into account one factor that might be inappropriate concern in the difficult federal equation in modern times and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.630" offset="3781818">That if in a particular case, the impact on the Federal Treasury is too severe, it is perhaps something that could be taken into account by the Court to allow payment over a period of time, not award full back pay, do something other than might be done in the private sector and just what would be done --</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.948" offset="4755140">I am not debating that with you at all, but I am simply suggesting that the fact it may be a demonstrable violation of Title VII does not make it necessary a violation of the Equal Protection Clause unimplemented by Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.823" offset="4810624">Look, here is like Kahn against Shevin.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.585" offset="4825671">I will accept that Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.406" offset="4840926">Nevertheless here, Congress acting with an abundance of evidence in effect has implemented Equal Protection Rights which needed protecting and what is happening here and what can happen here and what I suggest did happen here is the State of Connecticut and you cannot point to one individual official and charge bad faith on one official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.339" offset="4960672">But for over two years, the State of Connecticut did nothing about correcting this discrimination until a Lower District Court acted and then the State of Connecticut did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.280" offset="5020440">Now, it would seem to me that if the state felt it had a strong legal position, it would have done what the purpose of Title VII, the intent of Congress and what I believe the recent cases of the Court state, it would be promptly have in view of the complaint filed by the plaintiff’s, the petitioners here, it would have promptly re-evaluated this aspect of its employment practices and done something about it or at least in view of the situation created by the Edelman decision as read by some Courts, we have the danger that a state faced with this sort of complaint will simply do nothing about it until a Federal Court is forced to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.017" offset="5247392">Had the State of Connecticut acted with any promptness here we would not be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.654" offset="5265886">Our prime suit was to get this practice stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.109" offset="5283754">The back pay came in almost incidentally because the matter went on for so long after the institution of the complaint and I would submit unnecessarily so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.379" offset="5368809">Now, the Edelman decision which I just referred to is one I would submit is not applicable because it did not concern itself with Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.960" offset="5455117">It did not have the situation which is so important in this case that Congress specifically included states in the legislative pattern and in doing that, I think there was a recognition that this sort of problem is a problem that Congress can most appropriately decide and then Congress took the next step and said well of course we can only decide on a broad basis, we will have to leave it as it has always been the case in discrimination situation for the lower court, the trial court in the particular situation to fashion the appropriate relief which is of course an injunction and other relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.089" offset="5671620">Well now that relief just does not appear by magic on the date of an injunctive decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.078" offset="5699623">A lot of hard work, a lot of needed incentive, this is totally aside from the deterrence upon the employer has to go into this sort of suit that is before you today and other suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.824" offset="5758556">I might mention here of course that my clients at least had the benefit of some sponsorship in a class situation, but there are going to be lots of cases of individual employment discrimination where a person who believes he or she is the victim of discrimination by the state employer is contemplating enforcing that claim, vindicating this interest that Congress has given the highest national priority to and yet realizes that here he or she has a difficulty, the Eleventh Amendment problem, the Edelman-Jordan problem of possibly not getting back pay, possibly not getting attorney’s fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.172" offset="5963983">Now, if enough state employees make enough noise and band together, maybe they will interest the Attorney General, but if they do not, a lot a valid claims are going to go wanting and the state employer is going to be able to postpone as I submit was the case here, postpone the day of reckoning and this subverts the purpose of the 1972 Amendments and it seems to me, it undercuts everything this Court had said recently in Albemarle and the case like Franks and Bowman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.232" offset="6144228">Furthermore, in Edelman there was a distinction drawn which I hope will not be applicable to this situation between prospective and retrospective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.644" offset="6225834">I just touched upon this by suggesting that if there is some cut off point, it should not be at the time of the decree, but some point further back in time when the employer, the employer state has noticed that something is amiss and it should at that point reevaluate its laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.165" offset="6351953">Essentially here and I have tried to reserve a few minutes for tomorrow, essentially, if it please the Court, we are asking the Court to finally face up to a question that has remained unresolved for some time and that is whether the Fourteenth Amendment does pro tanto limit or abrogate the earlier Eleventh Amendment in this vital area of Civil Rights where the rights being enforced are incompatible with whatever the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment seem to be whether they are merely to protect the state from ordinary commercial debts or to somehow preserve the state’s sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.295" offset="6572531">The post civil war history was that great inroads were made on that state sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.369" offset="6616835">This was the intent of all the framers and proponents of the reconstruction amendments and the reconstruction legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.713" offset="6654138">And there was a vast transformation worked which gave much more power to Congress and Congress of course then passed some of it on most appropriately to the Federal Judiciary and this situation, now if the lower court decision is to stand is going to be in effect reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.246" offset="6752254">Now, I think I would reserve the rest of my time Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
