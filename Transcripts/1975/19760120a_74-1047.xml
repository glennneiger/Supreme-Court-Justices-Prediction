            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="75.515" offset="405337">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.045" offset="415472">We are here on writ certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.829" offset="430623">The history of this litigation is rather complex, but I think the facts that need to be stated for purposes of this review are stated rather briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.249" offset="460298">Respondents are six black residents of Chicago who brought this action in 1966 against a Department, an Agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.488" offset="501258">On behalf of a class of black tenants in and applicants for public housing projects in Chicago, their claim which was subsequently upheld by the courts was that hard-aided public housing through financial assistance to the Chicago Housing Authority and that when it made that financial aid it knew that members of the Chicago City Council were blocking the efforts of Chicago Housing Authority to place this housing in white residential neighborhoods thus reinforcing patterns of residential segregation and most of the tenants and applicants here were black.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.982" offset="655276">It should be said in this case by the way, I think it is of some interest that when we -- as this case is developed, to phrase a black residential neighborhood or a limited housing neighborhood means one with more than 30% blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.477" offset="709193">So it can be 30% black and 70% white and still for purposes of this case be described as a black neighborhood or it can be within one mile of any such census tract that still be described as a black neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.808" offset="762587">Respondents brought a companion suit against the Chicago Housing Authority and the Court found that that authority had in fact engaged in these discriminatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.758" offset="798323">It issued an injunction among the terms of which were an order to halt the practices, to build the next 700 dwelling units in the substantial a year over 70% white residential areas of Chicago and to locate at least three fourths of those units would be in those neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.707" offset="874182">Now, in the parallel action against HUD, the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit reversed the District Courts dismissal of the complaint and held that HUD’s knowing act re-essences in CHAs, Chicago Housing Authorities admittedly discriminatory housing program brought HUD in the violation of the Fifth Amendment and of Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.435" offset="969059">I make no contention here of course that HUD did not violate those provisions by knowingly funding Chicago Housing Authority, but I think simple justice to the HUD officials involved requires me at least to note that during the time of the violation according to District Court, HUD made efforts, consistent efforts to correct what was happening and had succeeded in some respects and the Court of Appeals itself said that was fully sympathetic with HUD’s dilemma of being forced to choose between the funding of construction of public housing in black neighborhoods or denying housing all together to thousands of needy Negro families.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.588" offset="1133630">The Court of Appeals on that appeal emphasized that its holding should not be construed as granting a broad license to interfere with the programs and actions of what it described as an already beleaguered Federal Agency and it suggest that the District Court might find that little equitable relief was needed beyond a best-efforts clause necessary to remedy the wrongs that had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.967" offset="1227149">At that point in the District Court, the actions against HUD and CHA were consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.047" offset="1247524">The District Court did enter a best-efforts clause and they were still outstanding of course against HUD and they were still outstanding of course the relief against the Chicago Housing Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.697" offset="1290052">The District Court specifically rejected plaintiffs’ proposal for a hearings to develop a plan of metropolitan relief for the areas surrounding the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.871" offset="1334773">Upon appeal, a wholly new panel of the Seventh Circuit with one Judge dissenting, reversed and remanded for consideration of a comprehensive metropolitan area plan and that is the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.150" offset="1435919">There was a prayer which was granted in the District Court after the remand from the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="339.178" offset="1460057">Well, I believe there was a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.893" offset="1470923">Yes there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.261" offset="1476357">I believe there was a request to join them in the prospect in the District Court before the appeal so that a much (Inaudible) plan could be drawn up.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.534" offset="1533408">But the Court of Appeals ordered that a comprehensive metropolitan area plan be now considered is what is judicial here, meanwhile District Court has permitted respondents to file a supplemental complaint to add as party’s defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.730" offset="1606238">The 11 Local Housing Authorities outside the City of Chicago as well as the Illinois Housing Development Authority, the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission and the Director of the Illinois Department of Local Government Affairs and respondents’ current assertion in this Court is that housing in six Illinois Counties, Cook, a part of which is the City of Chicago, but much of which is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.532" offset="1697457">DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will, those counties which contain 12 Local Housing Authorities and over 300 cities, villages and townships are the area which should be swept into this case and put under judicial supervision and used as a remedy, to remedy an act of segregation that occurred entirely within the City of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.225" offset="1788259">Now, none of these counties or housing authorities or municipalities has been in this case previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.960" offset="1811142">None of them has been found to have committed any acts of discrimination, much less any acts of discrimination related in any way to what happened in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.473" offset="1849177">The objection of the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to the judgment of the Court of Appeals is precisely this.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.379" offset="1884808">The secretary of HUD will be required to impose obligations upon communities that are without fault in order to achieve a remedy for respondents that runs contrary to statutory obligations and a remedy that is not premised entirely upon wrong doing in Chicago.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="494.523" offset="2081353">Do you defend the District Court’s refusal to permit the joining of these outlying districts for the purpose of offering proof?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="505.102" stopTime="822.566">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="505.102" offset="2123671">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.677" offset="2125970">If the -- I think of the plaintiffs, I think this case is just like the Milliken.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.456" offset="2141121">If the plaintiffs allege and prove an inter-district violation, we would have a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.585" offset="2161601">But that is not the posture this case is in now and I think as this Court said in Milliken, a controlling principle which is consistently been stated in the holdings of this Court is that the scope of the remedy is determined by the nature and the extent of the violation and as the concurring opinion put it there, the Courts there were in error for the simple reason that they thought what the remedy they thought necessary was simply not commensurate with the constitutional violation found and that is what I think is difficulty here.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.558" offset="2285526">I want to discuss Milliken, but I first want to develop a point which is not fully developed in our brief, although it is present and which in and of itself seems to me fully dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.944" offset="2331083">As I said, respondents here proved a violation which was entirely within the City of Chicago and relief was ordered there quite properly and on this last appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeals ordered consideration of metropolitan relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.104" offset="2399733">Now, it gave a couple of reasons why it thought metropolitan relief was essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.401" offset="2420945">One was, that intra city relief had become less valuable while the case was pending because the number of neighborhoods with fewer than 30% black or outside of one mile within a census tract of less than 30% black residence had declined so that there was difficulty getting sites to put enough public housing in areas with more than 70% white population.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.489" offset="2533271">Well, I think it is important to ask why that is true and it is true not because of any action by any Governmental Unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.512" offset="2565350">It is true because of demographic shifts, shifts in residential patterns in the Chicago area.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.178" offset="2591994">Thousands of individuals and families made personal choices which they are legally free to make and as result we are told the Federal Courts must pursue those demographic shifts into outlying cities and townships and municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.373" offset="2656778">The Court is not pursuing Governmental action, or anything connected with Governmental action.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.387" offset="2680811">They are pursuing populations and demographic shifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.315" offset="2700559">Now, the other thing, the Court of Appeals said and it is quite clear in its opinion, is that it was reacting not to the constitutional violation in Chicago, but it was reacting to the phenomenon of white flight and it was reacting to sociological and demographic predictions about the distant future, 1984 was mentioned, the year 2000 was mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.009" offset="2799302">The remedy in short is actually addressed to a predicted de facto segregation and not to the limited proven de jure segregation in public housing in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.587" offset="2857608">I happened to think that the sociological and demographic predictions made by the Court of Appeals are not accurate and if sociology were relevant to this Court, to this case, I would think that the remedy chosen to deal with sociological trends is the worst possible remedy one could choose, but that is not the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.515" offset="2937333">Chasing demographic shifts and attacking purely de facto living patterns I think is not a proper remedial function of Courts and I think this Court recognized that fact in Swann against Charlotte-Mecklenburg and that seems to me sufficient to require reversal of the Court of Appeals here.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.401" offset="3020925">But aside from the principle of Swann, there is the holding of Milliken against Bradley.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.528" offset="3049451">This violation took place as I have said repeatedly within the City of Chicago and it is therefore inappropriate to frame relief in an area that encompasses 300 other Governmental Units, more than 300 other towns and villages with a complete strangers to the action and to the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.612" offset="3129803">Now, respondent's attempted answer to this is that this is not inter-district relief in the Milliken sense because it is not inter-district relief as to HUD, since HUD may operate over metropolitan areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.938" offset="3191034">That is fallacious, that answer is fallacious for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.263" offset="3204409">The first is, that this remedy, even if it is nominally directed or actually directed only against HUD in a legal sense, will actually destroy the autonomy and some of the political processes of the cities and housing authorities, who have no connection with the violation in Chicago and secondly, I think it is irrelevant, it is a fallacious answer because the remedy would compel HUD and this cannot be gotten around, this remedy would compel HUD to ignore obligations placed upon it by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.644" offset="3329901">Now, respondent’s argument as to the first point is that the 1974 Act permits HUD to bypass local communities and to deal with private developers.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.072" offset="3387580">And that --</text>

            <text syncTime="839.154" offset="3459887">They deal with private developers in any particular community, but under certain limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.685" offset="3482039">But my first point is that even if those limitations were not present in the statute about what HUD may do, it is wrong to say that these communities are not being involved in this lawsuit because the result would still be that communities that have done nothing wrong whatever and that neither need nor want any public housing would have public housing placed upon them by Court order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.412" offset="4160909">But my point is, that quite aside from the limitations placed upon HUD, and I think this is an important point, about dealing with local communities, if it were true, which it is not, if it were true that HUD could deal with private developers and ignore the local community, those local communities would have public housing they do not need, they do not want, they have committed no constitutional violation, and they are going to provide the services with a police protection, the fire protection, the additional schooling for families with children, to benefit citizens of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.494" offset="4309284">But, and I want to say this, my point is not merely, that that is not a proper equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.804" offset="4334571">My point is, that a rather extraordinary legal principle is being formulated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.169" offset="4359962">Well, we remember what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.187" offset="4368008">Chicago Housing Authority was held responsible because of the acts of the Chicago City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.231" offset="4392249">HUD was then held responsible because of the acts of the Chicago Housing Authority and now wholly uninvolved Town Governments are to be held responsible because HUD can reach them, that is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.493" offset="4449301">HUD is to be made in to a conduit through which the impact of local violations flows outward to all other Governments in the area, the respondents or the District Court think it useful to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.121" offset="4503844">Now, I say that is an extraordinary legal principle because it is Federal Assistance and Federal Authority increases not only in this field, but in all kinds of fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.130" offset="4539789">That principle will expand the equitable powers of District Courts to unheard of dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.590" offset="4565702">In this very case, I think, it is clear that this Court has been pushed from performing a traditional, judicial function of framing an equitable remedy into a position what is going to become necessarily a metropolitan wide land use and social planning agency on a continuing basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.250" offset="4648354">I think all of that would be bad enough, but it is also true in respondent’s brief, I think obscures this fact that metropolitan relief would require HUD to violate limitations built into which authority by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.582" offset="4713660">Now, it is all very well, I think respondent's counsel say that Congress contemplated metropolitan planning and that HUD officials endorsed metropolitan planning and that is entirely true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.372" offset="4760785">HUD does that and HUD will continue to think in planning metropolitan terms regardless of the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.114" offset="4783772">But it is also true that in metropolitan planning Congress has placed limitations and processes that must be observed and that a Court order would have to sweep away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.446" offset="4841137">And the relief proposed here, I think would reverse the Congressional thrust in the 1974 Amendments to 1974 Housing Act to return more decision making to local communities and let me indicate briefly a couple of examples of how coercion would be necessary or how violation of HUD’s statutory mandate would be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.042" offset="4927446">One example, a community which receives funding from HUD for community development activities under the Block Grant Program which is Title I of the 1974 Act, is required to prepare a housing assistance plan of its own housing needs in that community as part of its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.722" offset="5006231">Now, the statute requires or it is required that that housing assistance plan must be prepared by citizen participation including two public hearings for the citizens and it must be later reviewed and commented upon by the relevant area wide planning agencies to the State or the locality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.851" offset="5078747">HUD cannot unilaterally decide to work with a private developer in order to put up a public housing in that community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.993" offset="5115319">Instead, HUD is require under Section 213 of the Act to forward any proposal by private developer for public housing to the community and the community is required to determine whether or not that proposal is consistent with its housing assistance plan which it has been required to make and which had been made through citizen participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.284" offset="5204448">If a community says their proposal for public housing is not consistent, then Secretary cannot go forward unless she determines, despite that, that the proposal is consistent with the community’s own housing assistance plan, and if HUD does that and goes forward, and the community disagrees then the community may seek judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.104" offset="5287727">That is all built into the 1974 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.544" offset="5301519">Any community and the number of these communities do that has the Block Grant Program and a Housing Assistance Program, all of this would have to be swept away if you are talking about HUD dealing with the private developer without interfering with the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.567" offset="5361601">If a town is not a participant in that plan, then Section 213 CF, Title II applies, secretary consults with the town, of course the town’s wished has have influence, but the secretary shall not approve a proposal there, even from a private developer, unless she determines that there is need for Federally Assisted Public Housing, taking into consideration the applicable State plans and finding that there is or will be available in the area public facilities and services adequate to service, their proposed development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.048" offset="5495452">Now, I think that Court ordered metropolitan relief in this case no matter how gently it has gone about, no matter how it trained is bound to require HUD to ignore the safeguards of local autonomy and local political processes, the very safeguards that the Congress deliberately built into the 1974 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.701" offset="5730137">Finally, there is not a shred of evidence in this case that anything done within Chicago produced any segregatory effect in any other city and certainly not segregatory effect between Chicago and any other city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.656" offset="5805892">Now, there is Exhibit 11 which has been offered in this case and which is a map that is at the back of respondents’ brief and I must say, that that Exhibit 11 does not prove anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.223" offset="5852181">It does not prove segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.098" offset="5855733">It does not even raise a prima-facie case of segregation in any outlying city and it certainly does not prove any causation between what happened in public housing in Chicago and the situation in any outlying city.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.441" offset="6849118">I wish to make two basic points this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.662" offset="6861970">The first is, that a remedial order confined to HUD and extending throughout the HUD defined Chicago Housing Market Area is a practical option open to the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.685" offset="6914006">It would be an appropriate order in this case and it would not be an Inter-district Order under Milliken and incidentally it would not be an order that answers to the description that the Solicitor General gave you of the order that was entered by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.688" offset="6974088">I have a feeling that we are addressing two different cases here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.417" offset="6988925">The Solicitor General’s view of what is mandated by the Court of Appeals as I will show in a moment is not my view of what that Court has mandated or indeed of what would be proper under equitable principles the Solicitor General and I, I am sure share.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.194" offset="7104073">HUD has never exercised the power of imminent domain in the operation of these programs and the exercise of that power presents no problem, no obstacle in framing equitable relief here where a developer, public or private, has acquired land, it then applies to HUD for funds to promote a subsidized housing project on that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.094" offset="7191635">If it has not acquired the land, it never comes to HUD for the money in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.007" offset="7231341">The decree which the Solicitor General suggests mandates a judicial supervision of the exercise of zoning powers by local communities is not the decree we envision and it is not in our opinion the decree compelled by the Court of Appeals Order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.193" offset="7296125">I think the suggestion and it is one of many similar suggestions in the government’s brief and in the argument here this morning that a parade of horrors will be the result of implementation of a Metropolitan Remedial Plan at the District Court level is simply inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.297" offset="7364461">As our brief indicates, and we have cited cases and HUD regulations to this effect, subsidized housing is required to comply with local zoning and other land use control regulations.An</text>

            <text syncTime="1869.392" offset="7580860">If the District Court in its judgment on remand did confine such an order to HUD alone, it would have no direct impact upon Local Housing Authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.470" offset="7621193">They would not be decreedly (ph) involved, the order would not run against them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.686" offset="7638016">They would only be indirectly involved in the following way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.288" offset="7652435">If and when a Local Housing Authority voluntarily chose to apply for HUD subsidy funds in order to develop some housing, a choice, I repeat for emphasis would be voluntarily made on its part, there would be no impact if it chose not to do so, it would then be subject to the conditions that HUD imposed on the use of federal funds offered to applying Housing Authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.036" offset="7755462">In our view as indicated in the appendix to our brief, one conceivable remedial decree might be a direction to HUD to impose two additional conditions on the use of Federal Funds in the Chicago Housing Market Area by those who apply for such funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.768" offset="7818365">The first such condition, a condition essentially all ready contained in HUD regulations would be that housing be predominantly provided in the future in white rather than black neighborhoods because the history of the constitutional and statutory violation in this case is confining it to the black neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.126" offset="7891821">The second condition would be that a portion of the housing thus provided be made available to members of the plaintiff class as a remedial measure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3307.811" offset="13334590">A remand would send this case back under respondents' counsel theory to consider a metropolitan wide relief which we think can be shown now and we think we have shown now as a matter of law to be improper.</text>

            <text syncTime="3372.621" offset="13593830">The truth is, as I stressed in my opening statement, there would be an enormous practical impact on innocent communities who have to bear the burden of this housing.</text>
