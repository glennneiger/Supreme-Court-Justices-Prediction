            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="9.861" offset="113070">In this case there is not an opinion for the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.996" offset="125608">I have filed an opinion in which the Chief Justice Mr. Justice Steward and Mr. Justice Powell joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.265" offset="150686">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.871" offset="169076">The case arose out of the fact that respondent MacCollom was convicted in Federal court of uttering forged currency and he was sentenced to ten years in prison under 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.891" offset="217141">He didn't appeal at judgment of conviction, therefore didn't obtain the free transcript of the trial to which all indigent attendants are entitled when they do appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.464" offset="255489">He then filed a motion pursuant to Section 2255 of title 28 in which he sought to set aside his conviction on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel and insufficient evidence to support the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.565" offset="319855">He moved for a free transcript in connection with this motion stating that he could not effectively frame his arguments without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.934" offset="349321">He didn't elaborate on why these particular claims required a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.558" offset="367816">The District Court appointed counsel held a hearing, but refused to supply respondent with a few transcript and ultimately dismissed or denied his motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.249" offset="414627">Respondent then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and that court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.504" offset="435630">We granted certiorari and we now reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.635" offset="452139">Congress has expressly addressed the question of furnishing transcripts at public expense in 28 U.S.C Section 753(f) and it provides in substance that on direct appeal an indigent defendant gets a transcript automatically, but when a collateral proceeding after the opportunity for direct appeal is passed, the defendant gets a transcript if the trail judge certifies that the suit or appeals is not frivolous and the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.104" offset="585990">Here the District Court resolved those issues against respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.190" offset="602395">While it is undoubtedly true that these restrictions place respondent in a less advantageous position than a person of means, we reject his claim that it violates his equal protection rights under the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.901" offset="661223">To do so respondent has received an adequate opportunity to present his claim fairly and this is all that was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.357" offset="695078">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.593" offset="712005">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which he is joined by Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.163" offset="734261">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which he is joined by Mr. Justice Brenna, Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
