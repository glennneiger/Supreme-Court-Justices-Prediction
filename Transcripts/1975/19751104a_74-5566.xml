            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103367">We will hear arguments first this morning in 74-5566, Barrett against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.950" offset="163135">Mr. Schaffer you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas A. Schaffer</label>
            <text syncTime="17.063" offset="171599">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.704" offset="182152">My name is Thomas A. Schaffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.995" offset="187272">I am from Cincinnati, Ohio and I am the attorney for petitioner, Mr. Pearl Barrett in his action.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.646" offset="213917">The question that is presented before the Court this morning is a simple one and a single one and it involves whether or not Title XVIII of the United States Code, Section 922 (h) applies to the petitioner, Mr. Barrett who purchased a firearm in a purely intrastate transaction and was not himself personally involved in any manner with the intrastate transportation of that weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.418" offset="321019">The facts are basically undisputed and they are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.149" offset="335961">On the April 1, 1972, Mr. Barrett purchased a Smith &amp; Wesson 32-caliber pistol from one Larry D. Bates, the owner and operator of the Western Auto Store in Louisville, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.738" offset="394267">Petitioner later that day was stopped for a traffic offense in a Leslie County, Kentucky, the surrounding county.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.334" offset="424673">The police at the time they apprehended Mr. Barrett searched his vehicle and discovered the weapon lying on the floor on a passenger side.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.848" offset="462707">Some time prior to this occurrence, Mr. Barrett had been convicted of a crime of housebreaking in the Commonwealth of Kentucky so he was a convicted felon as described by Section 922 (h) and as that Section prohibits, he was allegedly forbidden to possess that weapon being under the disability of a prior felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.649" offset="545881">He was subsequently charged under Section 922 (h) and he was tried in Unites States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky at Jackson, was convicted on May 24, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.276" offset="600425">He then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit sitting in Cincinnati, Ohio and that Court affirmed the conviction on October 18, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.340" offset="656640">The government at page 27 of their brief in referring to the differences between the statute that we have here today which is 922 (h) part of Title IV of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and Title VII which was passed subsequent to Title IV state in their brief “That there is no reason to believe that Congress intended to produce this topsy-turvy result when it enacted these related provisions as different titles of the same act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="170.085" offset="783700">Petitioner contends today that indeed Congress did intend to produce different results with Title IV and Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.683" offset="818077">Title IV or Section 922 (h), that section with which we are concerned today covers in part the receiving of any firearm which has been shipped or transported in intrastate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.989" offset="875233">While Title VII which was passed subsequent to Title IV states that it is prohibited to receive, possess, or transport in Commerce or affecting commerce any firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.134" offset="927896">We would ask the Court to note the difference in position of the word “firearm” in those phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.785" offset="950466">We feel that this is an important distinction between the acts and as we go farther into the argument and bring out the legislative history, I would hope that the Court would recognize that Congress in placing that word behind the modifying words is the difference in the statutes and it is this difference that we feel controls the question that is before the Court this morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.783" offset="1258397">I would say that Congress has certain limitations as case history is developed, but in this instance, if a gun can be determined to have affected commerce as the cases have reported in the Title VII situations, I feel that that Congress does have that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.393" offset="1336869">But we do not have that question here and we are not raising a question as to the power of Congress to govern such activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.158" offset="1359961">We are merely stating that in this act or this statute under which petitioner has been charged, the government through Congress did not prohibit intrastate sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.640" offset="1401862">It merely spoke of interstate sales and we feel that because we have a purely intrastate transaction that Congress did not intend that to be covered under Title IV.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="383.699" offset="1638113">What words would you -- I think it would have to be in that last paragraph of Section (h) to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce with the word which has ever before, would that do it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_a_schaffer" startTime="405.091" stopTime="834.139">
            <label>Mr. Thomas A. Schaffer</label>
            <text syncTime="405.091" offset="1723690">I would think that that would make it a bit more clear, but I feel the Congress has adequately covered the situation with Title VII when they placed the word firearm after the modifying words of receiving, possession, or transporting in commerce or affecting commerce “any firearm”.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.351" offset="1796729">I feel that that phraseology does cover any firearm which at anytime in the past has been transported in interstate commerce and I feel the Congress must have determined that there was a deficiency in Title IV, otherwise, they would have not passed Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.951" offset="1867155">The government would have us believe that there would be a redundancy in the statutes, but I do not feel that is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.633" offset="1893800">I feel that Congress recognized that there was a loophole in Title IV and sometime after the passage of Title VII, they passed VII to amend that loophole.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.928" offset="1939044">As a matter of fact, Senator Long who was one of the sponsors of Title VII proposed an amendment on the floor trying to close the problem that they had had with Title IV and it was his contention that he wanted to tie up Title IV in such a way that no felon at any time might possess a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.553" offset="2025561">In response to a question from Senator Dodd from the floor, that question being “Senator Long is this amendment a substitute for Title IV?” Senator Long answered that indeed it was not a substitute for Title IV, rather it was an addition thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.634" offset="2101839">It appears to me that the existing legislation was obviously not strong enough at that time, otherwise Senator Long would not have proposed this amendment to cover any felon possessing any weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.502" offset="2149277">There must have been something that Congress saw and indeed we contend that there is something, a loophole here, but there must have been something that Congress saw that would have encourage them to pass Title VII to cover up the problems that they have been having with Title IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.322" offset="2208627">Indeed in House Report 1577 on Section 922 (h), prior to its passage, the House Report stated that the principle purpose of Title IV of the Gun Control Act was “To strengthen federal controls over interstate and foreign commerce in firearms and the history of that bill provided that what the government was attempting to establish was a more effective licensing system with respect to those people who deal in firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.548" offset="2337463">The Act was intended to limit lawful transactions to those between federal licensees, those people whom the government had given permission to sell firearms or, and this is a quote from the congressional record at page 14773, the Act that is Section 922 would limit those lawful transactions to those between federal licensees or to those persons who reside in the same state.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.396" offset="2448849">So here it is from the people who were passing the bill, words from their own mouth saying, we are not attempting to legislate intrastate sales between people who live in the same state, rather we are trying to establish government regulation over the firearms dealers, those persons to whom we will grant licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.461" offset="2533173">Title IV was passed as a responsive measure to the national concern over the sale and the transportation of firearms across state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.806" offset="2582492">The people of this country had spoken to Congress, had told them of the need to curtail this activity where one person could live in the State of Michigan, go into the state of Ohio, purchase a weapon, and then go back into the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.488" offset="2649261">The purpose for this is obviously because the State of Michigan is going to have tougher gun laws than the state of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.217" offset="2672144">It is easier for a person to go from one state which has tough laws into another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.495" offset="2697326">In addition, Congress was attempting to cut off the mail order supply of guns which I am sure the Court is aware has become a very grievous problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.918" offset="2730972">But again, we are talking with dealing in guns and persons buying guns out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.790" offset="2754482">Gun trafficking is what Section 922 attempted to curtail, not gun possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.351" offset="2796696">House Bill 17735 or Section 922 (h) as we have here was passed and was put into effect by Congress to eliminate this interstate or across state line trafficking in guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.136" offset="2871824">It appears to me that the key in this situation where we do not have an interstate transaction, also quoted from House Report 1577 at page 4415, “The Congressman stated that so long as the last step in the transaction is intrastate, the shipment would not be prohibited by Federal Law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="717.010" offset="2971403">We feel this is the crux of the case before the Court this morning. Congress did not intend, House of Representatives did not intend that Section 922 (h) would cover intrastate sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.049" offset="3015498">Indeed the Senate concurred in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.104" offset="3027723">Senator Tidings who was one of the major sponsors of the bill felt that the people who were to be affected by 922 (h) were “the juveniles, felons, and fugitives” who today can with total immunity and impunity obtain guns by mail or by crossing into state lines, crossing over state lines into neighboring states which have lax or no gun laws at all, purchase a weapon and then return to their own state.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.683" offset="3150080">Here we are talking about what I have been speaking of early what the House was concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.851" offset="3170769">That is the felon who may cross a state line, purchase a weapon and return to his own state.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.998" offset="3191354">That is a different situation than what is before the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.570" offset="3213610">Any over-the-counter sale, according to Senator Tidings, was to be prohibited except as Senator Tidings said in the buyer’s home state.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.920" offset="3258959">It is important I feel to define the word buyer and what Senator Tidings had in my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.612" offset="3281738">A reading of the legislative history does not indicate that there is any restriction or qualification as to the definition of buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.942" offset="3315070">Now, in other parts of the Act, they have defined the terms, they have spoken of felons and fugitives and juveniles, but as to the word buyer, there has been no distinction or qualification as used in this meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.255" offset="3372330">So we contend that if Senator Tidings felt that a citizen could buy a gun in his home state, they qualify under the definition of buyer, that citizen must also have included those persons under disability that being felons, fugitives, and juveniles.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.492" offset="4817320">In the Sullivan set of facts, we have a package of drugs which passes across state lines and is labeled brand “X,” if you will, if then a pharmacist may take that package and label it brand “Y,” the consumer is purchasing something which he has been misinformed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.185" offset="4904046">I would agree that Congress certainly has the power to protect the consumer at that point, but I also feel that in gun situation, we do not have quite that same set of facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1337.809" offset="5454603">There have been, as I am sure the Court is aware, a number of cases which have come from the circuits regarding the interpretation of Title IV and I have cited these in my brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.211" offset="6292193">This Court has spoken as I am sure the bench is aware in the case of United States versus Bass, the opinion written by Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.227" offset="6340258">That is to the best of my knowledge, the only case law that has come down and I will admit that that was not form of dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.472" offset="6377248">It was not the holding of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.230" offset="6388219">That case concerns as I am sure the bench is aware with Title VII, it was concerned with Section 1202 and in that opinion, Mr. Justice Marshall stated that he felt that Section 1202 or Title VII was significantly broader in reach than Title IV and he felt that by reading Section 1202 in such a way as to give it a broader interpretation, he felt that that preserved the significant difference between the receipt offenses of Title IV and Title VII and that is precisely what we contend today that there is a difference between a receipt offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.118" offset="6539834">One, it concerns intrastate receipt that is Title VII whereas Title IV concerns itself only with interstate receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.403" offset="6584974">Mr. Justice Blackmun in the case Huddleston versus the United States which is cited by respondent stated that he felt that from the outset it was apparent to him anyway that the focus of the federal law that being Section 922 was the Federally Licensed Firearms Dealer, the trafficker, the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.335" offset="6676611">That is the person or those are the people to whom Section 922 was to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.575" offset="6701584">Mr. Justice Blackmun went on to say that he felt the intent of the Act was to force the dealers in certain circumstances not to sell, to prohibit them from selling to certain individuals, so again, the focus is here on the dealer and not the buyer that is Section 922.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.443" offset="6797088">Petitioner, were he charged under Title VII, I contend this quite strongly would not have the argument that we have made today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.700" offset="6838152">I feel that Title VII does cover intrastate sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.925" offset="6854975">Title IV as I hope we pointed out to the Court this morning, Title IV was enacted to control the business of selling guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.403" offset="6888934">Title IV went into great detail about licensing provisions, regulations as to license, licensees or sellers of guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.467" offset="6929163">They went into strict rules as to whom the licensee might sell these guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.070" offset="6951628">It dealt specifically with intrastate transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.903" offset="6966884">It talked about mail order guns.</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.004" offset="7167295">We contend then the petitioner's conviction should be reversed on this basis. He purchased the gun in his home state of Kentucky.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.686" offset="7394038">Section 922 (h) is set out at page 11(a) of our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.365" offset="7420787">It provides in pertinent parts that it should be unlawful for any person and then there are four categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.028" offset="7451403">The first category is who is under indictment for or who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for term exceeding one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.137" offset="7487870">That latter category of person whom I shall refer to as a convicted felon, who is a fugitive from justice, who is unlawful user or addicted to marijuana or any depressant or stimulant drug or a narcotic drug, who has been adjudicated as a matter of de facto or who as been committed to any mental institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.602" offset="7561744">It shall be unlawful for someone falling within any of these categories to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.492" offset="7613258">The meaning of that provision we submit is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.527" offset="7633424">Once it is established that a firearm is a firearm that has been shipped or transported in interstate commerce then federal jurisdiction is established.</text>

            <text syncTime="2054.777" offset="8322430">I think it is very indicative that Congress rather than employ these standard phrases which is a part over which it constitutes or which is moving as or a firearm in commerce chose instead to provide that it shall be unlawful for any convicted felon or other category of potentially irresponsible person to receive a firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.937" offset="8439040">The structure of the Gun Control Act confirms our reading of the plain language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2108.298" offset="8536529">Now, to this end, licensees, all interstate shipments of firearms must be channeled through licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.328" offset="8572578">Once a firearm has reached a state, come into a state, the licensee is prohibited in an intrastate transaction from selling or otherwise transferring of firearm to a convicted felon or an indictee, a fugitive, or any other category of potentially irresponsible person, that is an intrastate transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.258" offset="8652304">Also, in an intrastate transaction a purchaser must attest truthfully that he is not a convicted felon and that he is not also an indictee, a fugitive, or other category potentially irresponsible person.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.368" offset="13708774">Ammunition is covered in Title IV which became the Gun Control Act 922 (h), but is not included within 1202 (a), so therefore, even under petitioner’s construction any adjudicated narcotics addict, to a fugitive or an indictee can with impunity get somebody to get a gun for him, get ammunition for him, even a convicted felon can with impunity get someone to get ammunition for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.361" offset="13820787">We think Congress simply did not intend to create this gap, especially when used such plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.250" offset="13852343">I might also say that whatever Congress intended, in 1938, with regard to that language, given the structure of the Gun Control Act in 1968, given all the prophylactic measures which I have mentioned that are geared toward keeping firearms out of the hands of convicted felons or other categories of potentially irresponsible persons and also given that Congress must have been aware in 1968 of its authority under the Commerce Clause to enact legislation that govern interstate transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.280" offset="13996435">It is not at all unlikely that Congress used this language and gave it, its common sense meaning that is that it covers the receipt of any firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.254" offset="14052337">One more thing, petitioner's construction 922 (h) would also relegate Section 922 (h) to a near redundancy with that provision I mentioned before, Section 922 (g) which already prohibits a convicted felon or other category of potentially irresponsible person from shipping, transporting, or causing to be shipped or transported in an interstate transaction of firearm, so that under petitioner’s construction 922 (h) would have an independent force and effect only in those very unique circumstances where the interstate shipment has not been solicited in any way by the convicted felon.</text>
