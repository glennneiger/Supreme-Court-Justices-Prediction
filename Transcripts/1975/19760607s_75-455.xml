            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="11.518" offset="119649">This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.534" offset="143786">The petitioner, Ralph Nader, had reserved a seat on Allegheny Airlines to fly to Hartford.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.462" offset="171475">He arrived to check in five minutes before departure time, but found that all seats on the flight were occupied.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.061" offset="205853">In the familiar terminology of air travel, petitioner was bumped.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.445" offset="227377">This resulted from the then practice of Allegheny and other domestic airlines of overbooking at least on many flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.457" offset="263426">Petitioner instituted suit claiming damages on account of alleged fraudulent misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.368" offset="291116">Petitioner had not been advised in the filed tariffs or otherwise of the overbooking practice and the resulting possibility of being bumped.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.842" offset="333017">It was acknowledged that this possibility was relatively remote statistically.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.527" offset="355691">The 1972 average for all domestic airlines was slightly more than one chance in 2000 of a particular passenger being bumped.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.985" offset="397591">The airlines are subject to extensive regulation by the Civil Aeronautics Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.803" offset="420788">Although the board was fully familiar with the overbooking practice, it had never been firmly authorized or expressly approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.963" offset="457464">The Court of Appeals nevertheless decided that petitioners tort action should be stayed to afford the board an opportunity to consider whether failure to disclose overbooking is a deceptive practice under Section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.177" offset="534369">We conclude for reasons set forth in our opinion filed today with the clerk, that there is no incompatibility between the maintaining of a common law tort action and the exercise of the regulatory authority of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.435" offset="603332">Indeed, we think this is clear from Section 1106 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.227" offset="626529">We therefore hold, reversing the Court of Appeals that a stay of petitioner's suit is inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.196" offset="658398">We remand the case for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.923" offset="677311">Mr. Justice White has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
