            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="12.723" offset="154253">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.277" offset="168463">This case is here on the Government’s petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which reversed respondents’ convictions for aggravated bank robbery and possession of the proceeds thereof, in violation of various subsections of 18 U.S.C 2113 and remanded the case for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.408" offset="248920">The facts maybe stated simply, respondents along with co-defendant Davis robbed the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.564" offset="281521">In the course of doing so, they assaulted several people in the bank, and in departing the scene of the robbery both respondents shot at and one at least hit a police officer who tried to intercept them.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.377" offset="332826">After getting away with their loot, respondents and Davis split up the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.045" offset="355500">For this event, respondents were indicted in an eight count indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.725" offset="378174">Seven of these counts charged robbery and assault and unlawful entry offenses under subsections (a) and (d) of Section 2113.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.836" offset="430628">The eight count, thanks to which we are here today, charged respondents with possession of the proceeds of the robbery in violation of subsection (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="93.098" offset="475663">The case was submitted to the Jury under instructions that allow the Jury to convict on all eight counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.835" offset="498651">The Jury was not told that the possession count was inconsistent with all the others, or that it could not return a guilty verdict on that count, unless it refused to convict on the robbery and assault counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.857" offset="550791">The defense made no objection to the failure to give this what I will call here after in the argument an either-or instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.462" offset="585168">The Jury convicted respondents on all counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.231" offset="600215">And imposing sentence the District Court stated that, this is set forth at page six of our brief, the Court realizes the 25 years is the maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.982" offset="639294">And the cases say that there is a merger of all of these offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.701" offset="654132">If there is any question as to the legality of that sentence, that is the Court’s intention, and the judgment indicated maximum sentences on each of the counts all that are concurrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.697" offset="702093">The maximum sentence for the (c) count would be ten years, had the defendants been convicted only on that count, however in effect they received the 25 year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.654" offset="745978">On appeal the Court of Appeals relying upon this Court’s decisions in Heflin and Milanovich reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.967" offset="771160">Held that the failure to give the either-or instruction was plain error and the proper remedy for this error was a remand for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.134" offset="803866">It explains this as follows, and this is at page 18 of our petition, there is no way of knowing what verdict to properly instruct the Jury would have returned in this case, and for a reviewing court to speculate on that subject would be to usurp the functions of both the Jury and the sentencing Judge, citing Milanovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.057" offset="879516">Since the Jury’s verdict was inherently inconsistent, the proper remedy is to remand for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.202" offset="912117">Before beginning the argument portion, I would like to make one correction in our brief at page 17, the brief of the United States --</text>

            <text syncTime="234.129" offset="1039804">Page 17, footnote 4, the second paragraph CEG(ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="239.049" offset="1059552">That Ethridge case is mis-cited, it did not involve equal concurrent sentences, and that citation should be deleted and I suppose, the EG(ph) signals should also be deleted because I can not replace it with any other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.000" offset="1111275">It is not pertinent to the main body of my argument but I did not want to --—I believe it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.041" offset="1151503">We have presented basically three arguments to the court in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.063" offset="1167595">First that the Milanovich decision is distinguishable on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.698" offset="1186089">Second, that the either-or instruction in the new trial remedy dictated by Milanovich were incorrect and that the case should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.407" offset="1228930">And thirdly, failing those arguments that any retrial that might take place in this case, should be limited to a selection by the Jury between the possession and the theft offenses, that it should not detail a retrial of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.143" offset="1295908">We have not argued although, it was argued in the Court of Appeals and it is a point that may perhaps be kept in mind, the plain error issue, Milanovich did not deal with the question of whether it was plain error because there was an objection in Milanovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.433" offset="1353064">Here there was no objection and presumably, if the either-or instruction was correct then we hope the court will hold that no such instruction ought to be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.900" offset="1386919">But if it should be given, had defense council pointed out to the court, the error could have been rectified at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.969" offset="1415235">Mr. Frey, as I understand it, you do agree do you not, that the person cannot be convicted of both bank robbery and of receiving or possessing the proceeds of the robbery of the same robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.685" offset="1486079">What we do agree with, we do not dispute Heflin, and what we do agree with is that there could be no accumulation or pyramiding of punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.803" offset="1530488">When it comes to the question of whether they can be convicted, I think that is not in a sense an important question, so long as they are not cumulatively punished.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.881" offset="1702791">On the facts of this particular case, I think there was simply no independent basis for convicting them of possession that would be completely irrational, that is right.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.243" offset="1752319">Yes, we would distinguish Milanovich from this case, because in Milanovich there were separate evidence of a separate receipt transaction.However --</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="422.937" stopTime="426.579">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="422.937" offset="1795056">17 days apart, it had evidence of each one of them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="426.579" stopTime="615.462">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="426.579" offset="1809580">But the Courts of Appeals in applying Milanovich have rather consistently taken, extracted from Milanovich the principle that the two offenses being inconsistent in law, although of course they are not inconsistent in fact, this either-or instruction must be given to the Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.746" offset="1886275">Normally, I believe it is important to submit both counts to the Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.800" offset="1902471">Now on the facts of this case where there was absolutely no independent evidence of possession, I think it would have been quite proper for the District Court simply not to instruct the Jury on possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.466" offset="1953149">Normally, and I might mention that the court has before it two petitions, which I guess, it is holding for the time being in cases that raise related facets of this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.830" offset="2002677">One is a case called United States against Sellers out of the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.028" offset="2015425">Now Sellers was halfway between the facts of the present case and the facts of Milanovich and that, or little closer to Milanovich I would say, in Sellers he was found with the loot sometime later.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.737" offset="2078223">So that there was independent evidence of possession, that would have been logically possible for the Jury to convict the possession only and not of robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.609" offset="2117720">That case might more squarely present the problem about which we are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.333" offset="2144679">There also is a case called Phillips, also out of the Fourth Circuit into which we have petitioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.535" offset="2165472">And there three of the Judges in the Fourth Circuit held that it was a defense to a possession charged to prove that you were the robber.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.288" offset="2200476">That also is to us a wooden and improper application of the principles that underlie Heflin.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.680" offset="2234017">I have mentioned those cases just to keep in mind that there is a broad spectrum of factual variance that can arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.496" offset="2273306">Now certainly in this case we have argued that these -- on the facts where all the evidence points to robbery where there is no independent evidence of possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.051" offset="2307474">At least in that case, there is no basis for ordering a new trial and at most it would simply be logical to vacate the possession, conviction and the concurrent sentence on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.288" offset="2360450">Now, I will say that respondents have argued that this case is not distinguishable from Milanovich, and their argument is based on the fact that one of the respondents, the evidence suggests that it was respondent Gaddis who was the driver of the getaway car and not an actual entrant into the bank during the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.986" offset="2447281">The argument then is that he is similarly situated to Mrs. Milanovich because he was not a principle that is he did not take the money out of the bank drawers.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.107" offset="2499735">That argument would have a little more merit where it not for the fact that he was a principal in one of the assaults involved in this case that is that it is he who shot Officer Cody according to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.033" offset="2539441">And so that, I think creates some difficulty in analogizing his situation to that of Mrs. Milanovich.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.159" offset="2611957">If that was up for the Jury and there was wholly different and independent evidence indicating that some 17 days later she agreed, dug up some, made a hole in the ground and dug up the proceeds of a bank robbery, and those were two separate --</text>

            <text syncTime="986.518" offset="4049423">The prosecution’s theory being that his possession of these bills, his recent possession of these bills permitted the Jury to infer that he was involved in the robbery itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.316" offset="4096548">The evidence showed that he was not one of the robbers at the bank but it also showed that he had been in the vicinity of the bank shortly before the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.744" offset="4130298">The Jury accepted the prosecutions’ theory and convicted the defendant of robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.608" offset="4161750">Now had there been an either-or instruction, unfortunately there was no possession charge in this case, the Jury would presumably have to acquit him of the possession charge of which he was clearly guilty pursuant to the Milanovich either-or instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.881" offset="4214830">The case was appealed to the Court of Appeals, I think Justice Blackmun may remember this case because he sat on the panel in the Eight Circuit at that time, and the Court of appeals said the evidence is not sufficient to establish robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.733" offset="4258298">It merely shows possession, the inference from possession to robbery is not strong enough where there is no evidence besides the guilty possession and therefore it reversed the conviction for robbery and in order the entry of a judgment of acquittal on the robbery charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.878" offset="4322873">Now this case, United States against Jones 418 F2 818, which is cited in our brief, had Jones been charged with possession as well as with robbery, had the Jury been given the either-or instruction, they very likely would have convicted him of robbery, acquitted him of the possession charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.320" offset="6600646">But it is clearly harmless error in the circumstances, it hardly warrants a new trial even if you were to hold that the prosecutor was in error in framing his indictment in that fashion and that the court was in error in submitting it to the Jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2101.710" offset="8510197">She took some of the marked money to the bank, the FBI discovered it there, went to her house and the remainder of the money or a portion of the money was found in her deep freezer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.098" offset="8555755">If the Court will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.243" offset="8560248">But none of the money, neither masked guns nor independent identification was ever given as to Gaddis and Birt at the trial of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.469" offset="8597237">To the Court’s submission, I will present two arguments in support of respondents’ position before this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.698" offset="8618135">First, this Court’s decision in Milanovich v. United States, which is applicable to the case involved in our view, is an appropriate statement of the law where defendant is charged and convicted, both of taking and receiving the same property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.202" offset="8676127">Second, any suggestion that an Appellate Court rendered the error that was committed in the Trial Court, by ordering the Trial Court to either dismiss the taking conviction or the possession conviction as improper, in our view; whether under the guise of some rule of priority, what has become known as the concurrent sentence doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.663" offset="8765988">Petitioner has properly stated the rule enunciated by this court in Milanovich, and again that rule simply says that where the Government chooses to indict both for robbery and for possession, then it is the duty or it is incumbent upon the Trial Judge to give an either-or instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.044" offset="8839444">Further, given Heflin v. United States, the rationale of this Milanovich decision is appropriate to this case, where these particular defendants were charged and convicted on a federal bank robbery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.796" offset="8898481">However, in his argument here today, the petitioner attempts to distinguish the case at bar on the facts, and thereby take it out from under the purview of Milanovich.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.197" offset="8944143">In our view, the factual pattern in these two cases is much the same, especially when viewed toward the activities of the driver of the getaway car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.714" offset="8994194">To point up what happens in a case and in our opinion why the government would choose to indict, both for robbery and for possession, I cite this court’s attention to a recent Eighth Circuit case, Dixon versus United States, 507 Federal 2d. 683.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.560" offset="9065560">In that case, there were three robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.685" offset="9078099">One drove the getaway car, he was indicted, and that was Dixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.013" offset="9099415">A mistrial was declared as to the robbery, but he was found guilty as to the possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.697" offset="9126060">That particular panel concluded that the no-charge was given, but it was harmless error given to verdict, and the comment was that the driver of the getaway car acted only as an aider and abettor to the robber.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.136" offset="9183843">And therefore it could be conceptualized as a separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.703" offset="9210174">This discussion of the distinction between the two, engenders, we think a consideration of whether or not this was a single transaction or two separate transactions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3245.901" offset="13086955">The courts had considered; of course, the legislative history of the statute says that it cannot run consecutive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.074" offset="13111614">So several courts concluded after the passage of the statute, that subsections (a), (b) and (d) for purposes of sentencing were all merged into the sentence, the most severe sentence of 25 years was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.944" offset="13163128">That is the terminology but of course the same court has said that subsection (c), a possession count will not merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.712" offset="13218194">And of course to completely answer the Justice’s question about retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.013" offset="13247346">As to these two particular defendants, there is some doubt if in fact this court concluded that a new trial was warranted, given the two trials that I have just alluded to, whether or not these two particular defendants would be given a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.700" offset="13298128">My point here today is that we have an issue of law, and I am here to discuss some of that, I want to make that clear if I might.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.030" offset="13327386">In concluding, Milanovich v. United States is a sound decision and is appropriate in my opinion for consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.492" offset="13365315">We respectfully submit, that this court one should not overrule that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.900" offset="13386945">And second of all should not in some way formulate a procedural cure for the error that was committed at the trial court, and that rather this case should be remanded for a new trial under the purview of Milanovich and Heflin.</text>

            <text syncTime="3384.384" offset="13640855">My point is that in effect counsel concedes away his case here to agree with your suggestion, because if it is true that the Jury ought first to consider robbery, and if it finds the defendant guilty of robbery, or admits its consideration of the possession or receipt offense, then the remedy surely is simply to vacate the possession.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.916" offset="13782961">Suppose that it was instructed that, if you find these people guilty of robbery, bank robbery, return no verdict on the possessions?</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.303" offset="13836564">Well that would certainly be better than returning an acquittal on the possession count.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.875" offset="13854850">That would at least theoretically leave the possession count open, but the question is why is a matter of sound judicial administration should the Jury be told that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.167" offset="13987970">And it seems to me as a matter of sound administration of Justice, you allow the Jury to return verdicts on both, and then it is the Judge who enters no judgment of conviction on the possession count but only on the robbery count.</text>

            <text syncTime="3573.354" offset="14396734">No, we do not challenge the ultimate conclusion that ultimately one who is convicted of robbery ought not to have a conviction on his record for possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.174" offset="14436022">But we are saying that as a matter of the Administration of Justice, you ought to let the Jury find the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.727" offset="14458174">In most cases you will have quite separate evidence of possession independent of the evidence of robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.333" offset="14480639">And if you do not have the Jury return a verdict with respect to that, you run the risk of having to have a later trial or of having double jeopardy objections if there is something wrong with the robbery conviction that would not taint the possession conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.440" offset="14521077">If, it is only one who is convicted of robbery who is immune from possession.</text>
