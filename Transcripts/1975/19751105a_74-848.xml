            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="66.517" offset="369383">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.393" offset="376906">We are here on writ of certiorari to the Court of The Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.007" offset="391326">That Court held that the petitioners, one of them was the Commander of Fort Dixon, New Jersey is required by the First Amendment to the constitution, to permit political campaign speeches by respondents and the distribution of literature in areas of Fort Dixon, that are open to the civilian public.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.231" offset="468230">A preliminary injunction was entered in this case requiring that of the Commander.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.693" offset="490069">This Court refused to stay by a vote of five to four, I believe and now a permanent injunction has been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.450" offset="517132">Respondent Spock and Hobson have been denied permission to hold a political rally on the Base under Fort Dix Regulation 210-26 which I will describe in a moment and the other four respondents were barred from the Base for the unauthorized distribution of literature under Fort Dix Regulation 210-27.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.162" offset="595917">The content of the particular literatures is not before us, is not in the record, is not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.666" offset="613994">Our respondents were barred because they refused to seek prior written approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.036" offset="631443">I think it will facilitate discussion if I take up the two issues separately and I would like to begin with the issue of political speech and campaign rallies on a Military Base.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.775" offset="674389">The Regulation at this issue is printed in page six of our brief, it is Fort Dix Regulation 210-26, paragraph 2 (a) and it states simply that demonstrations, picketing, sit-ins, protest marches, political speeches and similar activities are prohibited and will not be conducted on the Fort Dixon Military Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.290" offset="756413">The only part of that Regulation which is at issue here is the part that applies to and prohibits political speech -- political speeches, not the political speech in the informal sense but a formal political speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.188" offset="816077">Respondents I think in their brief and their argument and indeed I think the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit discussed that Regulation as if it were subject to the same analysis as the ordinance of a City Council applying to civilians within that city and I have no trouble in agreeing if that were the case, if this were on a special context, indeed the Ordinance, such an Ordinance would be unconstitutional on First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.763" offset="926314">But we are dealing here with a Military Base devoted to the training of soldiers, and It is never been held I think, or It is never been suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.516" offset="961318">I do not believe that the First Amendment converts a Military Base into a Hyde park for the convenience of those who wish to make political campaign speeches.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.314" offset="1004576">The fact that Fort Dix has and it does have some streets and parking lots, I do not think it makes a wide open forum for a partisan political rallies and I should note here that the difference from the civilian context is marked by the fact and I think it is undoubted that the Commander of Fort Dix has the lawful power to exclude all civilians from the Base.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.971" offset="1099140">I take that that is true from Cafeteria Workers against McElroy, I take it that is true from 18 U.S.C. 1382 and indeed I think that to be true because of I think It is conceded in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.773" offset="1138428">Well, it is true in Flower too, was it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="263.384" offset="1156818">I think Flower is a different case in a variety of reasons I am going to come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.518" offset="1189419">One I think; one reason, one point of difference it seems to me is that street was indistinguishable from any other civilian street indeed continued straight through from the city in the way that is not true at Fort Dix, but I think there are other reasons that the Flower does not govern in this case.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="294.989" offset="1283251">But if I recall correctly Flowers put emphasis on the fact that this was a public street, in fact going through that Base rather than the part of the Base.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.407" offset="1320972">I think that street was indistinguishable from the any other public street with shops and civilians are and so forth.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="309.633" offset="1341870">It barely meant that the Base there was divided into two parts by a public highway that went through some major portion.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="318.259" stopTime="326.867">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="318.259" offset="1376351">That is true and I think the Court said that their the Military had abandoned control of that street, I think definitely in Fort Dix that is not true.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="326.867" stopTime="333.190">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="326.867" offset="1410728">But civilians can certainly come on the Fort Dix without being stopped at a guard gate or anything like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.659" offset="1437896">Now the Commander I think retains the lawful power to change that at any time.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="337.954" stopTime="343.425">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="337.954" offset="1455136">Well, but did not he retained that power and in Fort Sam, Houston in Flower too?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="343.425" stopTime="415.097">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="343.425" offset="1476975">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if I thought that Flower had announced that they -- if they -- principle so broad as to say that if the Commander let civilians on the Base then he must let them on Base for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.523" offset="1549386">That is that any access means all access.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.212" offset="1560149">Then I would without hesitation ask this Court to modify or reverse or overrule Flower.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.468" offset="1577181">I do not think it should be read that broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.428" offset="1588988">One reason I think is that this Court thought that street had been abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.875" offset="1602781">I do not think there is any abandonment here for reasons I will go into and secondly 10 days after Flower in the Lloyd Corporation against Tanner case, this Court discussed the fact that a shopping center which allowed civilians or shoppers or people enter freely nevertheless did not extend the full invitation for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.592" offset="1701628">Now, I would take it that if a shopping center is capable of limiting the scope of the invitation, so is to exclude the exercise of First Amendment Leafleting, then a fortiori a Military Base has at least the same powers.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="415.097" stopTime="430.319">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="415.097" offset="1763695">Well, can you not argue just the opposite though that since the shopping center is in many respects private, it may be able to limit an invitation in a way that the government which is not private in any respect can?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="430.319" stopTime="550.961">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="430.319" offset="1824612">If Your Honor, you are referring to the state action difference, I think there may be that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.888" offset="1850839">On the other hand in Logan Valley Plaza, state action was seen and in that section of Lloyd Corporation against Tanner which discusses the ability of a shopping center to extend an invitation which is limited in the scope, they are not dealing with the state action problem. So that I think that aspect of that opinion is fully applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.835" offset="1938611">But in any event, I take it as a premise that It is un-denied that the Commander of this Base could exclude all civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.727" offset="1966196">I take it also as a premise that some deference is due to the judgment of the Military Commander, indeed that deference is expressed in 18 U.S.C. 1382 is to what activities harm the function of the Military.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.483" offset="2049265">The fact that there are open spaces here and streets, I think in no way conforms this case to cases involving the civilian context as Hague against CIO speaks of the streets in time and memorial being used as places for discussion and exchange of political ideas and it is that tradition that use that makes them a public forum and some sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.599" offset="2153651">In Lehman against Shaker Heights, this Court quoted the words of Lord Dunedin who said and I think it is perfectly applicable here, the truth is that open spaces and public places differ very much in their character.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.181" offset="2200044">And before you can say whether a certain thing can be done on a certain place, you have to know the history of the particular place.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.895" offset="2222928">The history of Military Bases in this country has been uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.782" offset="2238392">Campaign speeches have not been given on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.324" offset="2248632">That has been something that has never been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.364" offset="2260753">So far as I know Dr. Spock is the first candidate for a national public office or indeed for any public office who has attempted to give a political speech on a Base.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.295" offset="2432430">But that of course is not what is before us in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="726.812" offset="3010572">Now, that proposition I think if it were true it would force every Commander to choose between sealing his Base tight or allowing it to become Hyde park, a forum for political discussion and indeed if that proposition were true, I take at this Court would face much the same choice because this Court has limited access, political banners and campaign speeches may not be made in this building or on this premises, although access is allowed to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.990" offset="3111300">So I take it that if that proposition were generally true, this Court would put in the same choice of excluding the public or allowing political speech at least when it did not interfere with a particular session of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.280" offset="3156439">Any of those choices be quite wrong and it be quite wrong I think for reasons that parallel the reasons of forcing such a choice upon the Military would be quite wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.126" offset="3191757">And as I have mentioned also the Court of Appeals' proposition that access for any purposes, access were all purposes, seems to me also to be contradicted by the later opinion in Lloyd Corporation against Tanner.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.874" offset="3250794">It is a simple non sequitur and I think there must be some other policy reason one would have to search for.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.376" offset="3268766">Now, the only other argument worth mentioning made by the Court of Appeals is that a wide range of newspapers and magazines are permitted on the Base and the troops are allowed to listen to radio and television without restrictions or after the hours and the Court notes that sometimes minor party candidates do not get as much as media coverage and they do not have much money to buy media coverage as more popular or better known candidates do, and therefore, must make do with face to face campaigning.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.796" offset="3398438">Now, the Court concludes from that, that the minor party candidate is harmed because he needs to get on the Base, the face to face campaigning all over the rest of the nation to engage in, whereas major party candidates are reported in the New York Times or any of the magazines or on television.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.084" offset="3491643">And the Court concludes this remarkable analysis by referring to the Fort Dix policy therefore has “a feigned neutrality that serves no discernable Military purpose” and I would like to raise several objections to that although there are more than several that could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.535" offset="3565412">In the first place, I would like to raise the objection or like to point out that the statement that there is no discernable Military policy is simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.713" offset="3602193">In fact there is a crucial Military policy and that policy is the traditional safeguard in this nation of the separation of the Military establishment from our political processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.124" offset="3663842">It is not a question of will these people passing out leaflets or making speeches interfere with the training exercise, of course that can be prevented and it is not a question of will political opinions reach the soldiers, they reach in all kinds of ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.942" offset="5383117">But I wanted to say one of the thing about the statement that this is a feigned neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.152" offset="5415927">It is a real neutrality and if there is a disadvantage in getting media, proportional media coverage by these candidates financially disadvantaged candidates have no greater First Amendment rights than other candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.418" offset="5476949">The constitution does not require the Commander at Fort Dix to make his troops available as compensation for a candidate’s inability to buy ads or to attract the New York Times or the attention of NBC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.626" offset="5533791">If indeed that were the constitution which the Third Circuit appears to think it is, I would suppose that it would be true that the Commander could close his Base to all civilians except minor party candidates because he would be required to use his Base as a reservoir to compensate disadvantaged candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.379" offset="5616861">Now, there are more objections to it but I trust or I have shown at least that the policy is real and that the neutrality is not feigned but real.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.500" offset="6153311">However, to say that a tradition has been violated, I do not think means that it is not important, not crucial and not worth trying to preserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.833" offset="6178598">Indeed Congress, in a number of statues I think, cited at page 26 of our -- well, it is not 26, but cited in our brief has attempted to -- page 36 of our brief, we list some statutes in which Congress has tried to shore up this tradition and it maybe precisely because of knowledge that in the past some violations and breaches in that tradition have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.385" offset="6268877">I was -- my attention was called just yesterday to a letter by the President Lincoln to General Hooker when he appoint him in his command in which he said I am appointing you, there is some things about you I like and some things about you I do not like, he said, but you do keep -- he was a very straight forward President and he said, but you do keep your Military duties and politics separate and that I like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.494" offset="6369292">So I think that this has been a tradition and a safeguard that we have tried to insist upon, that has been violated from time to time, but I think that is only all the more reason to try to insist upon it now and continue to insist upon it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.239" offset="6660296">First of all, I do not note anyway in which the Solicitor General actually distinguishes this Base or these areas that First Amendment Rights were granted in this case from either the areas at Fort Sam Houston involved in the Flower or from the usual kinds of civilian streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.788" offset="6742425">They say that it is distinguishable and I still do not see the specific way that they distinguish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.605" offset="6765726">Regarding the question of Mr. Chief Justice Burger Burger, there are also highways, state roads and county roads that go completely across the Base and the one involving several the respondents here in the Wrightstown road exit which is pictured in appendix, volume 2 at page E2 is certainly indistinguishable from the city.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.258" offset="13512319">I think the case Hinges in addition to this neutrality question on whether civilians generally have the right to exercise First Amendment rights on these portions to the Base and that again I would subject to the Court’s usual analysis and an observation that views might be expressed that could undermine, it is hardly sufficient as a Military -- as a Government interest to override interest in freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.337" offset="13620674">And I think that if the Court allows that kind of observation to be held sufficient to impose a prior restraint, that is a serious problem and they have done exactly within the quote, they said they did not want to do it, they deprecated the value of freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.424" offset="13704998">I just like to briefly address then the second issue concerning the prior restraint on leaflets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.472" offset="13729239">It seems to me that if the Court agrees that civilians do have the right to exercise First Amendment Rights on these areas because they are essentially public street, sidewalks and parks and because there is no Military interest to do otherwise, then the Carl Area Right of being free of a prior restraint as to content, it seems to me would follow and the petitioners in their brief actually concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.984" offset="13819205">So if the Court accepts that analysis it seems that there is no problem as to the second point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3545.492" offset="14285230">Mr. Chief Justice Burger may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.087" offset="14291603">There is just a few matters I would like to clear up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.914" offset="14302993">There has been repeated reference to the Army Times which appears in the second part of the exhibit, plaintiff's exhibit on E3 and the censorship by the Base or something of that sort, I think it should be made perfectly clear that the Army Times is a civilian publication; it is not published by the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.090" offset="14367672">The Army has no control over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.217" offset="14376136">That ad could appear in the New York Times and come on the Base as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.020" offset="14407378">As to the other points I wish to touch upon, this reference to the fact that the candidates cannot get at the soldiers because they are confined to the Base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.373" offset="14440815">The truth is only the trainees are confined to the Base for the first four weeks of their training which means that there are three weekends total denied to respondents in their efforts to reach these gentleman off the Base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.074" offset="14503613">Mr. Justice White mentioned the fact that coming on to the Base was an attempt to appeal to soldiers as soldiers and I think that is crucial, I would refer the Court to the first volume of the appendix in several places, but particularly at page 178 where Mr. Hardy testifies, the reason he wants to get back on to leaflet, it says there are troops in both Thailand and the Gulf of Tonkin which could be easily reintroduced into some act of role there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.778" offset="14614372">So anti-war activity among GIs is still in my opinion and in the opinion of resistance, an important aspect of our work and something we need to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.222" offset="14648227">There is no doubt that this leaf letting in this speech was aimed at these people not because they were on enclave of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.211" offset="14676126">They could not reach, but because they were soldiers whom they wish to influence in their attitudes towards the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.497" offset="14705279">Now, I suppose I should say something about Flower since it has been discussed repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.553" offset="14725550">The picture, E2 which we have been asked to look at is entirely different from the picture I recall seeing of a New Braunfels Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.183" offset="14764002">You can see an obvious line where the town stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.769" offset="14778421">There is an ordinary civilian community with cleaners and laundries and pizza houses and so forth there and suddenly all of that community activity stops and you are clearly on a Military Base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.420" offset="14820949">So it is not indistinguishable from the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.312" offset="14828576">It is -- there is a clear line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.080" offset="14843623">Here Mr. Kairys says quite correctly that there was no abandonment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.889" offset="14878836">Military jurisdiction over even traffic violations is complete and any case goes to U.S. Magistrate not necessary to U.S. Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3740.317" offset="15064619">I cannot believe that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.321" offset="15068590">It becomes a trivial point in that all the Military need to spend the additional money to put a sentry at the post and say show me your pass or get a pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.342" offset="15108714">What that has to do with political campaign rallies on the Base, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.675" offset="15130030">I do not see the nexus between spending the money to close the Base in that sense and the First Amendment question and the separation of Military and --</text>

            <text syncTime="3765.752" offset="15166288">Indeed some Bases do have a sentry box there and they have a fence around them, but I take it from the arguments made that the same arguments would be advanced if there was a ten foot wall and two sentries at the gate?</text>

            <text syncTime="3781.451" offset="15229086">I take it so, because if the point is that the Base Commander much used his troops to compensate Doctor Spock or other minor party candidates whose inability to get a good a news rating then I think it would not matter whether there is a wall or whether the Base is open and I would point once more to Lloyd Corporation against Tanner and indeed the Grayned against the City of Rockford which said that even a public sidewalk could be denied for use for some purposes because of the interest in running schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.229" offset="15352175">I think the interest here in the separation of the Military and the political is clearly of that caliber and furthermore it is not a public sidewalk, it is Military Base which by tradition in this country has been closed to this kind of activity.</text>
