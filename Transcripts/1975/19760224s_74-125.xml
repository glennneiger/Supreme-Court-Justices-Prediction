            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="11.483" offset="119551">This case comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.977" offset="145569">It concerns lands that were held by the State of Arizona in trust for common school purposes, pursuant to the provisions of the New Mexico-Arizona Enabling Act of 1910 and what prompted the lawsuit was the United States' condemnation of some of the state trust lands in connection with the flood control of the dam and reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.492" offset="243580">At the time of the condemnation, the lands were under lease from the State to private parties, and the issue is as to allocation of the condemnation proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.498" offset="291646">The District Court awarded the Arizona a certain portion of the proceeds for its interest in fee, and then awarded the lessee another portion for the improvements on the land and the remainder for its leasehold interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.159" offset="350264">On appeal, the Ninth Circuit approved the allocation for the improvements, but it held that under the Enabling Act, the State, as trustee, had no power whatsoever to grant a compensable leasehold interest, and therefore, that the lessee at the condemnation took nothing beyond the value of the improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.095" offset="429990">In other words, all the rest went to the State, as trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.289" offset="446813">We find ourselves in disagreement with the Court of Appeals and the judgment accordingly is reversed and the case is remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.007" offset="481608">Usually, the Fifth Amendment protects the outstanding leasehold interest and makes the holder of that interest entitled to just compensation when it is taken upon condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.133" offset="526121">We note, however, that it maybe that under state law the lessee could not posses a compensable leasehold interest upon federal condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.920" offset="565304">There are other questions in the case as to value and as to the basic validity of the interest, and all of these questions remain open on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.451" offset="599473">I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting in which Mr. Brennan has joined, and Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
