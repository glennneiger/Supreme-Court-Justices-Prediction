            <label>Mr. Joel Lewittes</label>
            <text syncTime="57.834" offset="334592">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.468" offset="349220">The issue presented today is whether the Due Process Clause requires that an inmate who was transferred within a state from one maximum security facility to another maximum security facility with no imposition of disciplinary penalties before the notice of the reasons for the transfer and an opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.506" offset="441380">The underlying facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.064" offset="451516">The respondent Haymes was incarcerated at Attica Correctional Facility in August of 1971, Attica being a Maximum Security Facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.654" offset="497909">His conviction was for manslaughter in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.821" offset="514628">Attica is one of six maximum security facilities in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.531" offset="537407">On June 9, 1972, the Respondent Haymes was transferred from Attica to Clinton which is another Maximum Security Facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.670" offset="577949">Two days earlier, prison officials at Attica had confiscated and seized from Haymes a petition he was circulating on behalf of other inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.471" offset="625178">This document denominated by the respondent to be a petition was addressed to the District Court of the Western District of New York and entered a claim that the discharge of Haymes on that very day as a law assistant in the Law Library at the Attica Facility had already deprived 82 signatories of that petition of legal assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.214" offset="724130">In addition to that, the petition also complained of eight various attitudes of the Correctional Officers in-charge of the Law Library.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.953" offset="759134">A few weeks later at the Clinton Facility, Haymes filed a Pro Se Complaint, returnable in the Western District of New York against various Attica Officials and he raised two claims in that complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.837" offset="814618">Number one, he claimed that the confiscation of the petition was entitled to damages for that in the amount of $1,500.00 compensatory damages and his second claim was various acts of retaliation, including the transfer, had been taken against him and he sought $1,500.00 punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.033" offset="895389">With regard to the general claim of retaliation, only one aspect was pursued by counsel in the District Court and that was the issue of transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.858" offset="930706">In the District Court, the Court held that with regard to the transfer issue it was dismissible and they did dismiss it, holding that even though it was alleged that the transfer was punishment, there was no allegation of harsher or substantially different treatments since he was transferred from one maximum security facility to another maximum security facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.605" offset="1009700">However, in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the Chief Judge Kaufman pointed out that simply all an inmate has to do was to claim or allege that the transfer was a punishment and that would entitle him to his day in Court, where he could prove the transfer was punitively motivated and that the consequences were onerous to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.644" offset="1101860">The Court did not in any way analyze the facts to determine whether or not there was indeed an underlined liberty or property interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.370" offset="1140835">The Court simply defined punishment as harsh treatment meted out to reform, to deter, or reprimand and suggested various consequences that flow from the transfer itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.164" offset="1187960">Number one, there was a claim, a hypothetical claim I should say, that was set forth in the opinion of the Second Circuit that he will be removed from his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.184" offset="1232055">The Clinton Facility is several hundred miles away from the Attica Facility from which he was transferred?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="joel_lewittes" startTime="289.427" stopTime="322.286">
            <label>Mr. Joel Lewittes</label>
            <text syncTime="289.427" offset="1260998">Yes, it certainly could have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.535" offset="1265492">He could have been obviously been placed in the Clinton Facility initially, at which point he would have been 350 miles so away from his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.580" offset="1313661">The Court, that is the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, also suggested that he suffered grievous loss in the sense that he would be removed from his friends in the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.063" offset="1363607">The other suggestion was that there could possibly be a loss of property during the time of the transfer.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.286" offset="1392447">Do you think that Second Circuit would have said he suffered a grievous loss if he had been moved from one cell block to another in the same prison, presumably he would have been moved away from some of his buddies there?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel Lewittes</label>
            <text syncTime="332.035" offset="1431421">It would seem that under the rational of the Second Circuit, the answer to that would be yes.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="341.776" offset="1470396">Is that because of the issue raised by the confiscation of the petition?</text>
            <text syncTime="346.949" offset="1491085">Is that why you say they treated it the same way?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel Lewittes</label>
            <text syncTime="348.675" offset="1497981">I say they have treated it the same way because the Court without analyzing whether or not there was a property interest or a liberty interest said that so long as the inmate subjectively feels that there was punishment involved, he is entitled to his day in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.197" offset="1572065">It is clear in the hypothetical suggested by Mr. Justice Rehnquist that a movement from one cell to another cell may be subjectively on the mind of an inmate punishment, and therefore, would be entitled to his day in Court and he may even claim grievous loss and that his cell is not close to friends of his cell by reason of the movement to another cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.000" offset="1659314">So that was the reason for my affirmative answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.696" offset="1698079">Would that be appropriate treatment in response to his exercising a right to his lawyer or something like that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1259.489" offset="5141227">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.425" offset="5157005">I think the questioning of the Court to my colleague from New York clarified the issue, particularly the questions by Mr. Justice Stevens, as to what the Court of Appeals was concerned about and that was the conduct of Haymes as alleged in the complaint which led to the transfer rather than the transfer itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.497" offset="5249269">What has not been discussed yet is the procedural posture of the case before the Court of Appeals and before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.213" offset="5280198">The state in their reply brief, filed last Friday, now concedes that the District Court granted a motion to dismiss, that therefore, the allegations of the complaint must be construed liberally, must be assumed to be true, and that they have no evidence in the record at this point to contradict the allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.381" offset="5360865">The Court of Appeals limited its inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.608" offset="5369746">It did not reach the merits in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.469" offset="5381136">They limited their inquiry to whether the complaint stated a colorable claim and they appropriately remanded for an evidentiary hearing, basically on three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.109" offset="5423767">Haymes should have the opportunity to prove what his conduct was?</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.259" offset="5444352">If it was protected conduct then he should have the opportunity to prove that there was casual connection between his conduct and the summary punishment that is the transfer and finally if both of those could be proved, whether he suffered injury and then the present status this Court needs not decide the merits of any of those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.492" offset="5525227">Those are appropriately for the District Court in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.927" offset="5542990">In the light of the state's new view of the present posture of the case is immaterial, I believe, at this point whether we consider this was a Pro Se Complaint as we argue in point 2 of our brief and apply the Haymes kind of test or whether it is the traditional rule on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12 as this Court recently said in Scheuer v. Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.450" offset="5633060">In any event the allegations of the complaint are assumed to be true, it must be read in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.</text>
