            <text syncTime="91.979" offset="471282">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.902" offset="490926">That Court en banc reversed the panel decision and held that the agency-shop clause in the Collective Bargaining Agreement in question here contravene Texas’ law prohibiting such forms of union security.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.633" offset="565845">That clause is as common required the payment of dues by employees who have completed 30 days of employment as a condition of continued employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.339" offset="624673">The collective agreement here is between the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers’ Union and it is local and the Mobil Oil Corporation and the agreement covers unlicensed seamen who work on the corporation’s tankers which ply the high seas between Texas and the Eastern ports and also on occasion between foreign ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.166" offset="747971">The clause in question is set out at page 281 of the printed appendix and the entire agreement is at pages 280 through 329.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.830" offset="794677">We believe that two questions are presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.393" offset="808888">The first is whether is what is the test for determining whose law applies when you have a situation in which an agreement is negotiated and administered in the different states and work is performed in still another jurisdiction and there are contrasting union security policies in all three.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.628" offset="905855">We suggest that the answer to that question is that the law of the jurisdiction where the bulk of the work is performed is the law that should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.792" offset="954442">There is a second question and that is whether the test we have just stated applies in a case such as this where one of the jurisdictions is the high seas or whether its application is limited to cases in which the work is land-based within the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.505" offset="1193306">The District Court found and it is a conservative estimate that the covered seamen do 80 to 90% of their work on the employer’s tankers that I have just described while those tankers are on the high seas and outside the boundary of any state.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="343.387" offset="1476891">The Lower Court would not make such a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.381" offset="1496849">We do not believe that the point of hire or the point of residence are the points which indicate who is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.445" offset="1541153">However, if you had a unit where you had people working in one state and other people working in another state, then we would think that there would be a difference and the leading NLRB case which we rely on makes just that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.159" offset="1619938">There are bargaining units from time to time which are in more than one state.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.617" offset="1657763">The District Court held that since the Mobil Oil Corporation’s headquarters for -- administrative headquarters out of which it ran its American flag tanker fleet was in Texas that the greatest part of the administration of the agreement took place in Texas when you compare that state to any another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.280" offset="1776464">Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals majority, however, gave any weight to any of the activities which occurred on shipboard in reaching that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.422" offset="1836963">As I have already stated, it is our view that really the only operative fact that is relevant here is the fact that the overwhelming bulk of the work takes place on ships which are on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.067" offset="1911569">We suggest that the job situs is the appropriate test for four separate reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.815" offset="1958589">First of all, the job situs test, we believe is the test which most accurately reflects the language of Section 14(b) which is the operative provision of the Federal Labor Law in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.281" offset="2048451">Before getting to that, if I may digress, in 1947 there was a complete review of the entire question of union security by the Congress in connection with the passage of the Taft-Hartley Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.796" offset="2110517">And the resolution of that review was that as a matter of Federal Law, uniform throughout employment in this country, the close-shop which requires union membership at the time of hire was to be barred that no employee who is not a union member at the time of hire could be required to join the union for the first 30 days or pay dues, that thereafter there was nothing in Federal Law which prohibited as a condition of continued employment the requirement that employees pay dues, but that the states were free to enact their own policy on the question of whether after the 30th day of employment, employees could be required to pay dues or become union members as a condition of continued employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.003" offset="2339350">We think that that background is relevant because it indicates a Congressional determination to be neutral between right to work and union security states.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.606" offset="2393789">Both policies are valid under the National Labor Law and since both policies are valid, it seems to us clear that there has to be a circumscribe scope for the policy of a right to work state or of a union security state and the limitation has to be one concerning what employment relationships are centered in that state because if one state could unless export its policy to cover employment relationships and another that would be contrary to the basic policy of neutrality and the question, therefore, is what is the meaning of the employment relationship?</text>
            <text syncTime="615.663" offset="2565989">Where is the center of the employment relationship?</text>
            <text syncTime="618.433" offset="2577064">As I have indicated before, I started that digression, we believe it is the place where the employees are working and we believe that that is the test first of all which does the best service to the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.292" offset="2652506">Among other places, Section 14(b) is set out in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.042" offset="2671523">It is a short provision at page 14 of our opening brief, the brown brief for petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.328" offset="2712588">It is phrased as a permission to the states and it is phrased also in terms of covering numerous states.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.122" offset="2767758">To put it in focus, we think that a fair paraphrase of the language is that each state may prohibit the execution or application of an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment in that state or territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.712" offset="2862217">And we think that on the normal and accepted concept of where is somebody employed for purposes of determining what his permissible conditions of employment are 30 days and thereafter during his tenure of employment, it is a place where he is working.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.229" offset="2940271">That just seems to us to be the common sense of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.348" offset="2960751">It is true as the company points out that the statute prohibits -- permits the state to prohibit both the execution and application.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.527" offset="3001397">It is in the disjunctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.034" offset="3011429">Either one or both may be prohibited by a state, but we do not think that that cuts against our argument that the prohibition has to relate to employees who are working in that state because with the common sense of that, we believe is that a state may prohibit execution of an agreement covering employees in the state in question in order to assure that the agreement can be declared unlawful before anybody is discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.931" offset="3126994">If the state were only to prohibit application, the argument could have been made we take it, that the mere execution of the agreement if no one is discharged is not illegal and we so not --</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.653" offset="7893923">So, without research in that area and looking out has turned out nothing, I would have to say Your Honor is correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.711" offset="7958184">We take the position that under the phrase “application” there comes things such as enforcement of the agency-shop clause itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.385" offset="8000816">Justice Douglas held that in the Schermerhorn the second, the second Schermerhorn case which this Court unanimously decided in 1963 when he said that if there could be any doubt that the language of the Section means that the Act shall not be construed, authorized any “application” of a union security contract such as discharging an employee which under the circumstances is prohibited by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.556" offset="8149505">The legislative history of the Section would dispel it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.226" offset="8164238">So therefore, Your Honor, I think that when we speak of application, we cannot just look at work as my colleague has suggested, but we must look at things such as the enforcement of a union security clause and this Court has squarely noticed of that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.706" offset="8238113">Now, it is our contention that we start with the proposition laid down by this Court in the Cooley case that a state can enact a law regulating Maritime Commerce, if the State Law covers the matter and not requiring a single uniform rule nationally and if the State Law is not conflict with the National Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.399" offset="8360888">Now, in this situation, on the question of uniformity Congress says there shall be this uniformity in the area of right to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.475" offset="8413237">Again, in the Schermerhorn the second opinion which I have referred to, Justice Douglas wrote for the unanimous Court that there is a conflict between State and Federal law, but it is a conflict sanctioned by Congress with directions to give the State the right of way to state laws barring the execution and enforcement of Union Security Agreements and he used the word enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.946" offset="8551060">He did not say execution and application as the statute does, he departed just a little bit and said the execution and enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.828" offset="8650638">And on this uniformity point, he further said that Congress in other words chose to abandon any search for uniformity in dealing with the problems of state laws barring the execution and application, he is back, Mr. Justice he is back on state laws and application of agreements authorized by 14(b) and decided to suffer a medley of attitudes and philosophies on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.014" offset="8779370">So in that regard, I think it will be well to see what we have here on the subject of uniformity from the Solicitor General who filed a brief at the invitation of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.224" offset="8856170">In his brief and that is the Solicitor General’s brief on page 14, he said that he agreed that the United States agrees that a state right to work law can be applied to the Maritime Industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.936" offset="8927014">That is what he came up with Your Honors, after looking it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.301" offset="8940493">Now, he filed three briefs with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.157" offset="8947912">The first, he filed a memorandum urging you to grant this writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.861" offset="8970795">Then he filed a brief with you and then he filed a reply to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.951" offset="8991171">So I am talking about his primary brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.404" offset="9004963">He says in there that the United States agrees that a state right to work law can be applied to the Maritime Industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.782" offset="9038400">Then he further says on that same page that Section 14(b) of Taft-Hartley contains no exclusion for maritime workers as does the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.037" offset="9087510">Then he further said that Congress expressly permits diversity of regulation as to union security and then his grand finale which I think is most pertinent here, he says Maritime Commerce would not necessarily be disrupted or hindered by the application to different ships or different employers of different union security rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="2857.446" offset="11533094">Now, of course the thing wrong with that bottom-line approach is as this Court knows in the HK Porter Company case, this Court held that the Court cannot tell parties what to put in their labor contract and cannot tell them to modify their clauses, but can only tell them to bargain.</text>

            <text syncTime="3106.833" offset="12530658">Your Honors, this is with Mobil Oil Corporation and Marine Transportation Department Gulf East Coast operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.255" offset="12560333">The importance of that is that this was a separate employing unit and the multi-state reciprocal act which is cited in our brief and recognizes that in maritime employment, unemployment compensation coverage can be handled with the state where the headquarter is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.102" offset="12631700">It refers to employing unit and of course, I think we have rather Texas flavor to the case perhaps without saying that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.152" offset="12675899">He also told you that 5% is closure to the mark as to the amount of work done in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.519" offset="12705365">Your Honors, this has been a creeping percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.503" offset="12717381">In the union’s initial answer they said, less than 5% of the work was done in Texas, but when it came time to submit findings of fact after two-day trial, they submitted a proposed finding in which they got it up to 10% and then when they submitted am amended -- a proposed amended conclusion of law, they got it up to 20%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.919" offset="12807033">And we have evidence here Your Honors that puts it up higher than that because these ships come to Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Houston, and Bay Town.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.236" offset="12844232">They are adding topping off to their cargo, then they go up East and discharge and they come back in Ballast and the proof shows there is a grievance here where a man -- that ship loaded in three different ports and he (Inaudible) in Beaumont and he wanted penalty pay for an overtime matter because it had been in all those ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.938" offset="12931063">So, what I am saying to this Court is that more than 20% of the work in fact is done within the territorial waters of Texas in the normal trade and further, some of the works is done on the shore in Texas.</text>
