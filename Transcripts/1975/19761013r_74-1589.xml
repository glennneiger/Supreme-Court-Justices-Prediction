            <text syncTime="89.763" offset="433676">Mr. Kammholz, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theophil C. Kammholz</label>
            <text syncTime="94.471" offset="452484">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.967" offset="470456">The issue here on reargument as it was the issue last January, is whether the exclusion of pregnancy related disabilities from an employer’s Disability Income Protection Plan is violative of the effects proscription of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.912" offset="562198">General Electric in its comprehensive insurance program has an Income Protection Plan in affect since prior to 1950 which provides benefits to employees who on account of sickness or accident nonoccupational incurred are absent from work.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.409" offset="668256">The benefits continue for a maximum of 26 weeks and commence on the eighth day in the event of sickness first day in the even of accident, the maximum the 60% of earnings with a saving of $150 per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.671" offset="741294">This plan incidentally dovetails with a long term disability plan for the catastrophic kind of accident or illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.034" offset="782776">The plan excludes pregnancy related disabilities and the reasons, the historical reasons therefore and which apply today can be summarized in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.202" offset="843380">Sickness and accident involves the unforeseen, the unexpected.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.863" offset="874100">Pregnancy basically is a planned event, neither sickness nor accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.812" offset="905865">At General Electric, the return rate of employees absent because of sickness or illness is in the 90% plus percentile except for pregnancy where the return rate is about 40%.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.666" offset="969291">So, in essence to provide this kind of disability payment for pregnancy disability would be providing a kind of severance pay to women only.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.289" offset="1011713">Additionally and the statistics are basically the same at General Electric as across the land under insurance plans, the cost of SNA coverage for females on the industrial theme where the exclusion of pregnancy related disability runs about a 170% of male cause or to put in another way, for everyone $100 expended for male SNA coverage a $170 is expended for female coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.756" offset="1165627">If as the undisputed actuarial testimony of the trial indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.626" offset="1189137">If this pregnancy exclusion were extended to six weeks coverage, the percentage total will run about 210% or $210 expended for every female on the average is contrasted with the male and if there were unlimited sealing on pregnancy disability coverage, the total would run between 300% and 330%.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.965" offset="1302509">Again at trail the undisputed testimony indicated, that to strike down, the kind of elimination that we’re talking about here would add annually to the plans currently and affecting the country $1 billion and 353 million in cost.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theophil C. Kammholz</label>
            <text syncTime="335.380" offset="1416089">No sealing as contrasted with any other sickness or illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.885" offset="1430091">Under GE for example, 26 weeks of coverage.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="342.702" stopTime="345.349">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="342.702" offset="1445451">Well, that’s not unlimited, that’s limited to 26 weeks.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="theophil_c_kammholz" startTime="345.349" stopTime="461.843">
            <label>Mr. Theophil C. Kammholz</label>
            <text syncTime="345.349" offset="1456004">Perhaps the characterization is inaccurate, but it would be in the same category as other benefits under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.049" offset="1494770">Currently the coverage of SNA applies to perhaps 40% of the American industrial workforce according to the record and we are talking only about those plans because there is no requirement that General Electric or any other employer impose a plan with or without pregnancy disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.627" offset="1601140">Now, of the 40% plan coverage the record again demonstrates that only 40% of those plans, 40% of the 40% provide some kind of maternity, pregnancy disability coverage and all goes to without exception the sealing on it is six weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.453" offset="1700406">Now, if the EOC is right in this situation, that six week sealing falls by the wayside, there can be no distinction as to total amount available and this is one of the difficult cost implications that give rise to deep concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.573" offset="1784938">In the insurance industry practice with respect to individual insurance policies, SNA policies is a very simple one, it excludes pregnancy related disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.975" offset="1834466">On the simple theory, that if such an individual plan were available to females, the insurance would be procured after marriage or when a pregnancy was planned and this would obliterate the underlying concept of what insurance in this area is all about, protect against the unforeseen, the unplanned, the unexpected.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.420" offset="1944285">The insurance industry then excludes all pregnancy related disabilities, even those that are complication of normal pregnancy, is that what you are saying?</text>

            <label>Mr. Theophil C. Kammholz</label>
            <text syncTime="507.788" offset="2105722">Generally speaking, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.352" offset="2111991">It is a practical matter and I don’t want to do come with record here with a cosmetic surgery for example, where there is no coverage under the GE policy with respect to the hospital, surgical aspect of it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="524.486" stopTime="528.122">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="524.486" offset="2172491">There is no coverage under GE policy for cosmetic surgery.</text>

          <turn speaker="theophil_c_kammholz" startTime="528.122" stopTime="851.962">
            <label>Mr. Theophil C. Kammholz</label>
            <text syncTime="528.122" offset="2187119">For cosmetic surgery as far as hospital, medical expense is concerned, there’s coverage for the in and out of the hospital but with respect to cosmetic surgery this runs a day to two, the heavy cost is what the physicians charge, the surgeons charge in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.014" offset="2286698">The decision for exclusion of this kind of coverage is as I noted, further buckers by the unique nature of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.906" offset="2326195">Essentially it’s a voluntary thing as the record gain points out without dispute and this is an expert for union testified, it would be a strange commentary indeed if the survival of the human race depended upon sickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.129" offset="2411145">Contraception in the society which New York Times recently characterized, is one having reached almost a 100% level of contracepted control of birth, is such that it’s the plan pregnancy that almost invariably applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.806" offset="2513859">To equate then, the pregnancy related situation with sickness and accident generally would be a non-secretors and now we come to Geduldig v. Aiello, this courts decision in 1974 in the California insurance case where under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.230" offset="2611557">The court held that pregnancy is unique and that there was invoked not a situation of dissimilar treatment, a person similarly situated but rather the dealing with a unique situation a sui generous situation pregnancy with respect to which there can be no discrimination these are the males.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.822" offset="2721898">I should like to comeback to Geduldig in a moment, I would like to touch now on why we are here, whether the Congress in 1964 in the enactment of the Civil Rights Act contemplated, the obliteration of this kind of exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.409" offset="2800265">Your Honor is recall, I am sure that the sex proscription surface for the first time in the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.726" offset="2837464">The day before the house adopted Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.430" offset="2856272">Ironically the sex amendment came about as the result of the proposal by representative Howard Smith of Virginia who was an opponent of the Civil Rights Act and finally all of the male representatives who voted for the sex amendment ultimately voted against Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.004" offset="2966613">The legislative history is very sparse indeed as a Fifth Circuit pointed out in Willingham and if I may, I think I can put him focus more precisely the point I am trying to make here by giving this quote, last year Willingham in a sex plus case a hair-length case the court said, “We find the legislative history regarding sex discrimination in conclusive at best” and may I say this appears at page 13 of our supplemental brief dated September 15, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.686" offset="3133379">We find the legislative history regarding sex discrimination inconclusive with best and drop at one conclusion and that by way of negative inference, without more extensive consideration congress and all probability did not intend for its proscription of sexual discrimination to have significant and sweeping implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.990" offset="3222509">We should not therefore extend the coverage of the act to situations of questionable application without some stronger congressional mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.421" offset="3272246">Upon the adoption of Title VII, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission beginning in 1965 and continuing for six-and-one-half years articulated the precise view that we are espousing here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.976" offset="3346538">The view that because pregnancy is different, the prescriptions of Title VII on the sex subject, we are not intended to reach pregnancy exclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.923" offset="3386244">Now, I submit to that contemporaneous interpretation by EEOC should be given great wait and the change which occurred in 1972 with 180 degree reversal in the agency abuse should be ignored to put it another way, we suggest that they were right in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="888.215" offset="3627407">The union has asked for such a change during the course of bargaining over the years and the union of course has asked for many other things their demands have been innovative, to say the least.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.159" offset="3683204">Now I think clearly this is a matter for collective bargaining, the parties elect to distribute a larger portion of the benefit dollar to this area, they could so do, but this would be on the basis of consideration as to what is appropriate in terms of dividing the benefit dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.866" offset="3802113">If I may return briefly now to Geduldig v. Aiello, Footnote 20 in that decision which articulates the sui generous nature of pregnancy and pregnancy related disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.534" offset="3868778">This is been a subject of great deal of consideration and writing not only by the courts but in the Law Schools and very recently also Arthur Larson a former Under Secretary of Commerce and now against be Duke Professor of Law at Duke University has published book not available at the time but the original argument in which he expresses -- I think expresses very subsequently, the consideration that are involved here, as he puts it a Supreme Court adoption of the EEOC rule, would on the strength of a statute aimed and not at social or private insurance reform but at employment discrimination change all this, rearrange insurance priorities in categories and markedly order the allocation of the limited resources available for wage loss, hospital and medical benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.154" offset="4147243">A way from both the creators and the beneficiaries of those plans, very often the view is suggested that in smoke-filled rooms decisions are made which discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.335" offset="4207952">The fact of the matter is in collective bargaining and in decision making on the part of management in an organized operations; what is the appropriate allocation of the benefit dollar indeed the, how does one divide the pie if you will in terms of the fringe benefits, wage increases, cost of living adjustment, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.537" offset="4312755">These decisions are arrived at in this sector as a result of careful consideration, no effort at discrimination but a desire to do what is best for the largest number and Professor Larson points out the ultimate decision here, the non-extension of pregnancy benefits to women really relates to the family unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.923" offset="4450264">There is a father for every child, the head of the household perhaps and it is the allocation of that money to apply for the greatest benefits for all involved, it is the underlying decision and because the family unit is in the majority obviously any decision that can be characterized discriminatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1555.270" offset="6295658">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.021" offset="6318646">I want to address myself first to the question which has been raised as to the relationship of collective bargaining to the issue of inclusion or exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.105" offset="6379041">This Court, as a matter of law, has recognized in cases involving a collective bargaining agreements, which discriminate because of race as far way before the enactment of Title VII that in Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville that union sometime do under in discriminatory contracts and if they violate their constitutional duty when they do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.580" offset="6504951">More recently under Title VII, Title VII is directed at the fact that both of them regards to race and sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.268" offset="6535671">Many unions have not and dealing with employers acted in a nondiscriminatory matter and the existence of a collective bargaining agreement is no excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.388" offset="6588125">Furthermore as the record here shows, since the time that fringe benefits became by law a bargaining subject with the Inman (ph) v. NLRB decision of the Seventh Circuit in 1948 with affirmed on another point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.023" offset="6674642">Next bargaining session, the first one with the IUE between GE and the IUE was in 1950, the record here shows with that dispute at 1950, the union point it out, the General Motors paid six weeks which is usually enough to take care of it in fact with changing medical practices, many other women get back in less time, we have two first witness in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.476" offset="6784461">From Tyler, Texas was certified back in four weeks, GE would not take her back, Mary Williams went back in four weeks, another witness here six weeks and my estimation on cost is not the companies that now pay six weeks if they begin letting employees comeback when they are physically certified back, they are going to have a reduction in cost not the increase in cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.543" offset="6868785">But the IUE went to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.001" offset="6882577">1950, 1955, 1960, 1963, 1966 repeatedly and asked if they bargain and included the six weeks benefit which is traditional, which is present in 40% of the industry in fact daily the companies actuary, I think is that a 60% of the industry pay six weeks benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.506" offset="7036595">They would not because, we think that the individual who has a complication, she really has a disease, no question illness, she needs the more and that it is discriminatory to limit this one area, the six weeks no question about it but I was just saying in terms of the union’s effort here over the years to get something for these women, and they union has wanted to spend, the union of course in the last rounds of negotiations is asked that it be treated the exactly the same you have record here that there be no limit whatsoever that it, not only go on for 26 weeks, but it go on under the permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.210" offset="7179433">We have the IUE is a plaintiff has suit against General Motors involving the six weeks time which I mention is in has file and had finding to that is discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.654" offset="7217258">But I just wanted to say if the union has tried to get this and there is an assumption that it seems to be employed in some peoples minds that the union asks for something like this, the company is going to willing to give it and that this demands was on the bargaining table during the long strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.448" offset="7344422">GE has a principle about not paying sickness and acts and benefits, now it pays for everything and I am afraid the record, the answer to the question may not have made it clear it pays for the time that a man is disable by cosmetic surgery.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.475" offset="7736468">Testimony of both their doctor -- now two weeks today is the majority of women are back at home doing their homework, taking care of the children which is harder work from job in the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.449" offset="7776383">That the medical position has changed and I have cited the point but the reason there actuary when he figures this billion, he figures that every women under a 13 week plan is going to be out 13 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.074" offset="7830927">Every women under 26 week plan is going to be out 23 weeks, every women under a 52 weeks is going to be out 30 weeks and he says why not because they are disable, they have a never made a pretenses because of disable because women malinger, they are there -- and you will find in the finding here, that court found they do not malinger but their actuary explain insurance position of why this is it not covered by insurance, is that women have a natural desire to take it easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.422" offset="7960285">They may have heard to someone had a miscarriage and therefore they are going to want to sit at home and they have a natural desire after the child is born to stay home with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.635" offset="7997170">Now if you knew these women, that have to have that paycheck, they do not want to sit home, they want a babysitter their who establishes the routine the day they come back and they want that check to pay it because it got it get back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.568" offset="8052863">There are 37 million women working in the United States today and it is the figures, Department of Labor as of April, the last figures came out in July of 1976 for the quarter ending April 1975, 21 million women either were single, divorced, widowed or had husband who made less than $7000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2050.764" offset="8277620">One of the plaintiff you testify without dispute, she lived in a country area, she had to walk two miles with a two-year-old daughter, her husband had left her to get food because she got on welfare, she waited the birth of a child to unlighted, un-eated health and GE is a stereotype.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.902" offset="8354211">Well they did not think anything what happened, the record showed she was a married women, in their view she has a husband who is going to take care of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.746" offset="8389633">The testimony here on the amount of time that women are going to be off and why GE does not pay this is that women are going to malinger and abuse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.152" offset="8427250">Their whole figure is on the cost, now if you take the six weeks which sister Mr. Belly says that the record that shows that he said that 60% of the women are covered for six weeks and another one under actuary figured how much it cost to cover the women in this country for six weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.821" offset="8545846">He said, he deducted the amount of a present cost based on it and he deducted cost $225 million to cover 60% of the women for six weeks which is what is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.346" offset="8611988">It will only cost $150 million for every company in United States to make up that other 40%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.753" offset="8641558">If 60% cost $225 million another 40% is only a $115 million and that is in six week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.149" offset="8683145">The figures GE based on and GEs positions at the bargaining table is that the women want to stay home and they are going to malinger and that has never tried to count out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.936" offset="8722329">He refused the figure, we asked for figures on how many his record are women returning, it refused the find them, it did not provide it, never provided any figure on its return rate, the number of weeks or days that women were out, it did and I think there was a slight statement, I am sure Mr. Kammholz did not mean to state, that there was a return rate of 40%, the return rate is 60% at GE on their figures on, there is no dispute in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.879" offset="8842074">GE and its objection seem derogatory why it did not want to provide me the figures I wanted on the expense pregnancy so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.899" offset="8874153">You know 40% turnover rate for males and females, 40% turnover each year, now with that turnover rate, the fact that 40% of the women can come back is no different then the man may have come back from a injury or something, or sickness but he is not going to be late before there are anymore chance that he will weeks, months later than these but GE and many companies have this position and they get a position that women are going to maligner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.071" offset="9002884">Now it may be this is because and they have no evidence on it, they (Inaudible) their actuary why when explains in the whole insurance business, they do not covered them in individual policies based on the affected women are going to want to stay home before and after they are going to maligner, this is an abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.306" offset="9079789">Is they are not subject to the same controls but occurred in case of a man and man would not stay out when he is sick or injured because he wants a merit increase, he wants a promotion, he is going to get back as fast as he should, but this does not work with women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.763" offset="9137676">This is straight sex stereotyping right down the line, the straight stereotyping is that we were not concerned about Sheryl Stein because the record shows she was married, it is a stereotype that is contrary to the fact United States has being existent life today and it goes much further than merely pregnancy because this attitude shakes the practices of the companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.421" offset="9248331">The payment of sickness enacts that benefits the American industry does not serve as benefit welfare system entirely, GE did not put it in with that in mind, put it in because this whole sickness actually says we get productivity, people are not going to worry about what is going to happen to them in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.115" offset="9335057">This is part of compensation, it says and it uses this as a control lever on when a person goes out and when they comeback, 60% of their wages a man, a women who have their budget geared and these are not high pay, they are the figures of the time here, we got the figures here on the hourly rate it was 6000 a year for a women, 7000 or 8000 for a man on the average.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.653" offset="9445189">Now, a lot of them get less than even females marry to GE males, you have trouble raising your family and making a budget on these kind of figures today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.359" offset="9479985">They work just a last minute until the drop the men that even have a sang, because they got it, they do not want a 60%, they want a 100% and they get back as soon as they can and supervisor does not want to put them out if they can find anything else for them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.506" offset="9548634">The Chairman of our GE Board broke an arm and I was asking about, do they put people on light work Oh, yes I was tool and die maker they did not say send me home on sickness and they had me answering a phone, they find late light work from, they have not found light work for women, they send them home without any pay, there is not to disincentive to the management to send a person home if they have to pay sickness and accidents benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.626" offset="9641108">They want to send women home as soon as they begin to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.078" offset="9662946">The court below I must say, it is said the Title VII intended that employment relations be sexblind as well as colorblind and while there has been remarks about how sex got into the Title VII, here in 1972 when Congress, for the first time, provided enforcement powers it said that sex discrimination is of the same concern as race discrimination and the courts have agreed that there is no difference between the two.</text>

            <text syncTime="2588.085" offset="10426976">Now, the courts below, here the finding of the EEOC was that there is an impact, the EEOC finding set out in the back of the petition for certiorari; there is an impact on this class because of the nine in coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.875" offset="10498133">The Court of Appeals here emphasized all women as a class; lose compensation because they would have to buy their own as a class.</text>

            <text syncTime="2681.442" offset="10800318">What we have presented today is the following fact situation against which Title VII must be measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.110" offset="10835008">We have a disability plan by General Electric which seeks to cover virtually all disabilities for men and women except one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.693" offset="10877327">A great deal has been said about the voluntariness of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.544" offset="10888820">Let us examine for a moment however the coverage of voluntary as well as involuntary disabilities for men virtually every disability including voluntary disabilities as they affect men are covered by this plan that includes everything from cosmetic surgery as noted to suicide to felonies or the results of felonies to voluntary sports activities to falling of ladders.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.038" offset="11006789">Yes it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.803" offset="11009820">There is no distinction in other words as to voluntariness or involuntariness in this plan with the exception and therefore I think to say that the plan is misdirected toward voluntariness of pregnancy is purely misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.419" offset="11068229">The purpose of Title VII however is to provide equal opportunity in the job market by excluding in various forms of discrimination including sex and we believe that given the legislative history and interpretations of the court, clearly two different theories would sustain a prima facie case of sex discrimination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.547" offset="11160807">First, the exclusion in this particular case is not neutral on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.736" offset="11177526">It does single out a condition which is so inextricably sex-linked to women that it is tantamount to a policy of excluding women from this otherwise total coverage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2978.381" offset="11988158">However, the court has held that deference should be paid to the guidelines and we think that that is sensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.668" offset="12021281">Either under a theory which would state that there is an inextricable relationship between race and the exclusionary factor or sex in the exclusionary factor, for instance, sickle cell anemia or under the impact theory of Griggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.523" offset="12076660">In either case, prima facie case has been made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.892" offset="12086169">Now, I notice the counselor concedes before you today that if sickle cell anemia were before the court that could not be excluded, I would submit that there is no logical or rational distinction under Title VII not under Aiello, not under the Fourteenth Amendment but under Title VII between an exclusion of sickle cell anemia, which we admit could not lawfully take place and the exclusion of sex related practices or disabilities such as pregnancy, I fail to see the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.881" offset="12198078">Therefore, we are faced with only two defenses or rather arguments in defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.202" offset="12219393">One is Aiello which we have just – I have attempted the deal with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.684" offset="12233291">The other is the business necessity or cost factor and if I may I would like to point out that in this particular case, cost cannot be a controlling factor in this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.020" offset="12282714">First of all, in the courts below General Electric refused to present a business necessity defense either in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.566" offset="12324824">It presented cost factors not for purposes of showing that the cost would be too high and indeed the admission that 40% of those industries that do provide these benefits have not gone broke, have not shut down their plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.891" offset="12382189">It seems to me to give the light to the theory that it ever could be too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.689" offset="12405385">So the business necessity defense is not even presented to the court. However, it comes in the back door right now it seems to me by arguing in this fashion by raising the horrors of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.044" offset="12454809">Yet clearly we do not need to find at this program in order to be sustained, must provide a cost that would literally shut down the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.471" offset="12496500">That is not an issue; it’s a red herring here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.469" offset="12508517">As for the notion that the six weeks coverage would have to be extended clearly what we are talking about and what counsel for –- appellate is talking about is a coverage that arises from sickness or involuntary disability arising after in normal pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.326" offset="12595870">No one is suggesting, and not is the counsel for General Electric suggesting that there would be up to 26 weeks of benefits for a normal pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.589" offset="12628993">Yet under the General Electric plan even an involuntary illness, an unpredictable illness that is pregnancy related would not be covered at all much less would have been covered on a basis that is similar to that which men have under the disability program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.211" offset="12687403">They are excluding both the voluntary, if you will, aspects of pregnancy and the normal aspects and the involuntary or abnormal aspects of pregnancy alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.919" offset="12722303">Yet it presents no cost figures whatsoever on how often abnormalities will arise and how much they would cost, instead it refers to industry wide figures that we would submit or in opposite to the problems faced by GE or indeed by the 40% of companies that have done this successfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.353" offset="12800043">There are ways, in fact, dealing with the cost issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.616" offset="12813105">The courts have held that cost itself is not a defense to discrimination where a case is made out and we agree with that and we also agree that the cost factors could be raised only in the event that a business necessity defense could be raised and again that is not either been tendered before this court this morning or in either of the courts below despite ample opportunity to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.447" offset="12904429">What we are faced with is a situation where General Electric has provided, has such provide an umbrella of coverage and yet it has plucked out one single activity from that umbrella and placed it in the rain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.236" offset="12959495">What we are talking about here is an activity which is not or rather a disability which is not been shown to be more expansive, for instance, than one that males face and indeed the record will indicate that in the insurance area as opposed to disability coverage, men in GE costs to the company much more than women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.112" offset="13039011">The insurance program cost them more if we were to find that respiratory diseases or heart disease or other specific diseases were actuarially defined and the company wanted to take those into account to keep the integrity of cost factors at a minimum, that would be another issue but that is not what they propose to do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.640" offset="13117170">We believe that once the company undertakes as General Electric has to create a broad umbrella of coverage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.328" offset="13787890">It seems to me that if – yes, I think so, If the company can show that the absence of such a reduction is to close down the plant or otherwise disable the company, I would say that that’s a possibility that’s reasonable and what’s I’m saying further is that is, in fact, in law the only basis upon which the company can go either to court or to the union in the collective bargaining system and say we must make a change in order to accommodate pregnancy disability programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.349" offset="13896037">In the absence of showing that high standard of need, it seems to me that the chances are not great but on the other hand they need not be great because the company will not be faced with the disabling cost factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.038" offset="13962701">Several very quick comments and I should like to address the observations of counsel regarding what happens with collective bargaining people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.343" offset="14000004">Members of the Court in the real world out there, you do not take it away and the reference is inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.680" offset="14037307">Secondly, as we note in the supplemental brief dated September 15, 1976, the position of Deputy Solicitor General Lawrence Wallace, when he appeared before you in oral argument in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer seems rather clearly to embrace the view of Aiello, which we have articulated here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.321" offset="14139916">He says the – well, I’m not going to bore you with reading what we quote but on pages 8 to 9 of this supplemental brief we note what the solicitor’s office says there and I suggest it’s quite different from what we heard here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.104" offset="14206998">Finally, a very brief reference, Mr. Justice Blackmun to sickle cell anemia, this is an area that we have not covered in any of our briefs and I should like to note again that pregnancy is the only physical condition which is unique to one sex and as I understand the sickle cell situation it’s in an opposite because most blacks are immune to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.089" offset="14338969">Finally it’s sickness as I understand it and not a unique condition like pregnancy.</text>
