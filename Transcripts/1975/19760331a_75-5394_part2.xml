          <turn speaker="james_l_babin" startTime="10.006" stopTime="426.100">
            <label>Mr. James L. Babin</label>
            <text syncTime="10.006" offset="144910">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.566" offset="171137">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.600" offset="183257">To briefly just restate our position, right before we finished yesterday afternoon, after the Furman decision the Louisiana legislature at a special session, which requires two thirds vote to bring up the normal type of legislation, which this was, brought the Louisiana murder statute from the plain murder which would have previous to that time, first degree and second-degree murder, placing in the first degree murder statute, those crimes which are somewhat initiated by the defendant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.733" offset="327767">In other words, those that happen with specific intent, when he is in the perpetration of aggravated rape, aggravated burglary, armed robbery, such as that or people who are hired to kill, people who kill policemen while they are engaged in their duties and the more serious crimes and the crimes that defendants actually initiate and start themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.165" offset="429540">As I stated before, the second-degree murder statute, while it does carry with it some instances, specifically takes care of those killings where you may have a man who is in a bar, he is drunk, he is in a fight, he does have the intent to kill and he may kill someone, but it is not the type that you will find in the first degree murder statute, which this case involves.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.968" offset="536746">In Louisiana, the legislature also amended the responsive verdict statutes and the responsive verdict to first degree murder no longer contains the guilty without captive punishment responsive verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.201" offset="593693">It is either guilty or guilty of the other crimes, such as second-degree murder or man slaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.133" offset="621383">Now, when the judge gives the jury, who are sworn members of that Court, the instructions as to what they are to do, he will instruct them that you must find every element which is in first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.975" offset="680733">In other words, you must find specific intent to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.463" offset="694735">You must find every element in this case of armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.822" offset="716155">Then and if you do find such elements and it is proven to you by the prosecutor beyond a reasonable doubt, you are to return a verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.092" offset="757220">If the verdict of guilty is returned in such a case, no longer does the jury nor the judge have any control of what the sentence will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.959" offset="804658">It is a mandatory death sentence at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.554" offset="823048">The juries in the Louisiana and in the United States, if the argument of the respondent were to be believed or not dependable, that they will not attempt to follow their duties that they are sworn to do, that they have taken an oath to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.530" offset="906954">This goes further even if you were to follow his argument than the murder statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.349" offset="930255">It does not necessarily involve the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.812" offset="944048">If the jurors are suspect, if the jury is not going to follow his instructions, he has said that he would follow the law of the state and he has taken an oath to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.546" offset="991068">There is nothing further you can do to make him do that and if jurors are suspect, then the jury system can no longer exist and I certainly think -- I do not think that this Court in the Furman decision intended such a thing or a change in the system, such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.072" offset="1069122">The juries that I have had any experience with or the juries that I have tried cases before or I have seen cases tried before, appear to me to be the average person and the person who feels a seriousness, especially in a murder case of the job that he has before him and one that he would give his best ability that he is able to give to that particular job and to the facts that are presented to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.559" offset="1199107">The system that is set in Louisiana, takes away from the judge or the jury any arbitrariness in the verdict or the sentence that it will give.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.019" offset="1264936">The jury is instructed by that judge that whatever is proven to him, beyond a reasonable doubt, if it is a crime of first degree murder as in this case and the elements are proven to them, then it is their sworn duty to return a verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.922" offset="1344557">Therefore, we do not have -- we have guidelines first of all for a jury to reach a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.460" offset="1370679">Then, once it has reached its verdict, that it no longer has any control over that case or that defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.095" offset="1405266">The respondent as I understood also says that since the District Attorney of the various districts or the prosecutors have control over the cases, then you have another human element involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.192" offset="1457615">It is true that district attorneys and prosecutors in Louisiana and in all other states, I believe, have the right to try cases (Inaudible) as they see right, see fit or to charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.289" offset="1509964">But in a death penalty case in Louisiana, the district attorney cannot charge by Bill of Information.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.193" offset="1537654">He can only charge by Bill of Indictment returned by a jury of 12 grand jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.140" offset="1561373">Therefore, he has to way to be arbitrary in the initiation of a death penalty charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.485" offset="1586764">It must be brought by jury of 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.183" offset="1601602">Once the charge of first degree murder has been brought, as it was in this case by jury of 12 in Calcasieu Parish and once the defendant is tried and if he is found guilty, that district attorney loses control of the defendant, the sentencing and the charge itself, he no longer has any control, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.165" offset="1701494">So, the only control that a district attorney or prosecutor has is prior to the finding of the final guilt of an individual, but once in Louisiana this man is found of any crime, no matter what it maybe, but particularly in a death case, he has no control whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.202" offset="1789683">It is true in Louisiana that the governor has the right to commutate sentences.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.998" offset="4528779">We submit, as we had pointed out in our brief that there are number of obstacles to this holding, not the least of which is the Constitution of the United States and its Amendments, particularly the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.070" offset="4629089">We would urge that at this time the Court take the opportunity to hold in a case in which an issue is presented to them that the death penalty is not unconstitutional per se and is not in violation of the cruel and unusual clauses in the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.519" offset="4706934">We would also urge that this Court take this opportunity, if it deems it advisable, to lay down guidelines to aid the states and other and the legislatures of Congress in devising acceptable standards for the imposition of this punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.115" offset="4777256">We think that this will certainly aid the case load in the Court and prevent the states and the parties from coming back constantly for clarification and guidance in this difficult area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.796" offset="4891986">The California Supreme Court, contrary to the line of the decisions in that Court, some of very recent origin, held that the death penalty was rejected by society, that it was not serving a proper penal purpose and that it was in violation of the cruel or unusual provisions of the state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.142" offset="4985399">The response of the people was fairly quick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.236" offset="4997834">Within a few months a petition was circulated for an initiative and this petition obtained the signatures of almost a million qualified electors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.967" offset="5044750">This initiative would enable the constitution to have a provision that would hold that the death penalty was not to be deemed cruel or unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.259" offset="5085919">In November 1972, the electorate passed this initiative by approximately 67% of those voting over 5,300,000 people voting to have this initiative ratified and the Amendment made to the State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.807" offset="5160106">Now, we are certain that these petitioners are not going to be satisfied with the declaration, that the death penalty is unconstitutional just for their crimes of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.167" offset="5205455">We are sure that they are going to demand that it is entirely unconstitutional for any crime, regardless of an enormity of the crime and regardless of the legislative determination that there would be some penal purpose served by its availability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.926" offset="7552505">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.181" offset="7565566">The United States appears amicus curiae in these cases because the Congress has enacted in various precedents of signing the law statutes that permit capital punishment for various serious crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.803" offset="7612064">The constitutional argument made by petitioner’s counsel in challenging capital punishment generally, I think it is rather diffused and in fact, I think part of its power or part of its persuasiveness arises from its diffuseness and I will try to sort out these various propositions that are being urged and attempt to show their inadequacies, either singly or collectively to outlaw capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.565" offset="7699104">To begin with, we know as fact, that the men who framed the Eighth Amendment did not intend as an original matter to outlaw capital punishment because it has been mentioned, they prescribed the procedures that must be used in inflicting it in the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.299" offset="7770052">We know that the men who framed and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment did not to intend to outlaw capital punishment because they also discussed to frame the procedures which must be followed in inflicting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.921" offset="7816550">So, we know that as an original matter, as a matter of original intention, it is quite certain that the Eighth Amendment was not intended to bar the death penalty and the that Constitution contemplates its infliction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.711" offset="7855734">Now, the petitioners respond to this in their brief, by pointing out that the Fifth Amendment also refers to the infliction of -- report twice in jeopardy of life or limb, which they say obviously the Eighth Amendment would bar disfigurement today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.756" offset="7919891">And, of course it would, but I do not think that avoids the argument from Constitutional text, because punishments for disfigurements are today regarded as cruel and unusual precisely because the American people came to that conclusion and legislatures stopped enacting such punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.847" offset="7992198">So that today, I think the Court, if some legislature and an aberration tried to resurrect such a punishment, would find it cruel and unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.732" offset="8019783">But the point is it was not judicial movement that made that change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.009" offset="8036919">It was an evolution of the standards of decency in American society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.395" offset="8058444">Now, the Eighth Amendment, like some other provisions of the Constitution does have a principle of evolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.859" offset="8084253">The intention of the framers, it seems to me, it is entitled to an enormous respect, but one cannot exclude the possibility that cruel or unusual punishment means something different today than it meant them, but the principle is one of controlled evolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.498" offset="8150813">The Amendment is not an uncontrolled delegation of power to the judiciary to adjudge punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.940" offset="8184563">There are criteria, by which the judiciary adjudges punishments and I will try to demonstrate that the principle of evolution is applicable here, which controls the case here, not only does it outlaw the death penalty, but in fact, affirmatively supports it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.283" offset="8249974">Having done that, I will urge three other propositions that are raised in Eighth Amendment context by counsel, but I do not think belong there and hence has no proper place in this case, but I would nevertheless discuss them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.630" offset="8303368">I will suggest first that capital punishment is rationally related to legitimate legislative goals for the deterrence of crime and the special moral outage among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.737" offset="8347777">Secondly, that capital punishment has not been shown to be inflicted on the basis of race and that in any event, that question is irrelevant to the issue of the type of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.539" offset="8402947">And thirdly, I would argue that capital punishment is not outlawed, because the criminal justice system, which is mandated and permitted by the Constitution has elements of discretion in it, which are intended to be a safeguard of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.320" offset="8462088">The principle of evolution that controls the meaning of the cruel and unusual punishments clause, is that punishments may not be used, which fall far outside the main stream of our jurisprudence and which are rejected by the current moral consensus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.796" offset="8536067">That is consistent with a history of the clause and the cases that this Court has decided under the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.124" offset="8561354">Apparently, the cruel and unusual punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment, like the rest of the Bill of Rights was adopted because the anti-federalists, who objected to ratification of the Constitution, posed a series of terrible imaginings about the coming attorney that the federal government would impose upon the citizens of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.339" offset="8634183">And, one part of the rhetoric employed was the suggestion that the federal government would use torture, the screw in the rack in enforcing its laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.847" offset="8684234">The Eight Amendment promised that that would not happen and since the federal government, of course, had no such intention and did no such thing, the Eight Amendment became dormant from its adoption, which strongly indicates an understanding at the time that the clause was not to alter existing practices, but was to prevent intolerable innovations or reversions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.819" offset="8784126">Punishments native to our jurisprudence and still unused were simply not touched by the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.969" offset="8804710">The cases reflect that, we have discussed them at some length in our brief, but it was not until 1909 in Weems against United States that this Court struck down a punishment and that punishment was cruel and unusual in every sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.412" offset="8858523">It was very cruel Spanish punishment of incredible severity, imposed there for false entries in official accounts and this Court said in that case, such penalties for such offenses amaze those who have formed their conception of the relation of the state to even as offending citizens, from the practice of American Commonwealths and believe that it as a precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and apportioned to offense and I think that is the test of the cruel and unusual punishments clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.619" offset="10511342">I do not think it is no longer possible to think differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.552" offset="10531091">There were factual estimates, empirical judgments made in various concurring opinions in Furman against Georgia, which were fairly made, but which subsequent events has shown to be incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.111" offset="10585321">And, those proportions in Furman are now I think no longer available as premises for constitutional judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.419" offset="10614474">I would like to mention them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.732" offset="10623773">First it was said because the statutes in Furman provided for discretion, whether or not to impose capital punishment in a particular case, the legislative will is not frustrated if capital punishment is never imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.912" offset="10684482">We know now I think that, that was not the meaning to be drawn from the existence of discretion in the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.559" offset="10711022">By re-enacting death penalty statutes, many of them mandatory under certain circumstances, Congress in 35 States have shown that the legislative will is frustrating, if the death penalty is never imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.649" offset="10759401">Discretion was built into the prior statutes to distinguish between types of killings and types of killers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.602" offset="10791270">Congress and the legislators, legislatures of the states have shown that if Furman presses them to the choice, they prefer a mandatory death penalty to none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.593" offset="10839231">Secondly, it was said in Furman that capital punishment is cruel because it goes beyond what is necessary, not only in degree, but in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.010" offset="10876848">We now know that legislature after legislature thinks that capital punishment is necessary in degree and in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.168" offset="10917494">Though I think that this Court cannot really look behind that legislative determination, in a moment I will try to show that the legislatures have every reason to think it was necessary that they made an eminently rational judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.006" offset="10972874">Third it was said, in Furman again, that the penalty is unusual because it is infrequently imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.446" offset="10998578">As I have just in response to the Chief Justice, that seems to me not the constitutional meaning of unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.549" offset="11026999">That unusual refers to the type of penalty rare in our jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.838" offset="11044240">Like cadena temporal in Weems or like the denationalization in Trop against Dulles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.772" offset="11071930">Indeed, I do not think that the death penalty is unusual in any relevance sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.043" offset="11084991">It is imposed in a number of cases each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.781" offset="11099933">It is true that legislatures and juries and judges restricted to the most outrageous crimes, but I do not see how it can become unconstitutional, because it is used carefully, and sparingly rather than across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.858" offset="11164299">Would it be, the petitioners' argument seems to me to suggest that very broad categories of crime for which the death penalty was mandatory, would make it somehow more constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.902" offset="11208498">I think that is a very odd conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.052" offset="11221037">Now, we submit, therefore, that the death penalty is clearly not a cruel and unusual punishment under the meaning of the Eight Amendment and I submit that it is not -- the Eighth Amendment is not a warrant for requiring the states or the Congress to come here and justify affirmatively, the punishment which they wish to use, once it has been seen that the punishment is traditional, the American --</text>

            <text syncTime="3575.083" offset="14405154">Because, I think Furman refers to standardless jury discretion, that is all it really applies to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.317" offset="14442144">I think the statute that have been enacted in response to Furman, now out standards into the process, and therefore, it is not necessary to overrule Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.763" offset="14487910">But, I think it -- counsel made it plain that he objects to every element of discretion of the system, not just jury discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.429" offset="14526572">He directs them collectively and if I understood him correctly yesterday, he objects to that, he would have object to them singly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.883" offset="14548410">The power of an executive to exercise clemency alone would render, if they were the only elements of discretion, would render the death penalty unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.486" offset="14586758">There is apparently no way, according to this argument, that anybody can devise a system of justice in which anybody used any judgment about a thing, which could then inflict the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.575" offset="14643182">The system that -- the only system that would meet counsel’s objections would be one that was so rigid and automatic and insensitive that it would be morally reprehensible and then apparently it would meet the moral standards of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.059" offset="14701070">The incidence of the discretion that McGautha recognized, that are built into our system, were built in progressively to make the system safer and progress in criminal justice has occurred precisely by multiplying the instances and the stages at which discretion can be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.864" offset="14776302">As the system now stands, it is utterly impossible for one person or for several persons acting freakishly or capriciously, out of malice or prejudice or stupidity to inflict the death penalty, at every stage it is possible for a small group and sometimes for one person to prevent imposition of the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.231" offset="14865746">Counsel’s real complaint is not that anybody is freakishly convicted and executed, but rather that some murderers are freakishly spared and given life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.247" offset="14913811">In other words, the fault in the system, which makes it unconstitutional though it was inflicted is that it errs, if it errs at all on the side of mercy and on the side of safety and that what we are told makes it unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.808" offset="14968041">The more counsel explains that argument, the less I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.501" offset="14982879">Yesterday he said that it was true that all these careful procedures that were worked out by the states and by the Federal government help some defendants, but he said that means by ineluctable logic that the procedure is disadvantaged of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.290" offset="15045990">I have seldom heard logic, more electable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.339" offset="15062186">It is impossible to see how these procedures disadvantage anybody because the persons who were not spared, are not made worse off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.575" offset="15099176">They were certainly not disadvantaged by the existence of a chance to escape the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.909" offset="15124462">The argument I think is specious, but there are other defects in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.727" offset="15143793">These arguments that are made against the death penalty could be made against any other form of punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3832.877" offset="15436364">I would suggest to that, Mr. Justice Stewart, there is only one respect in which it is not different and that is in contemplation of the constitution, because the constitution provides for it with imprisonment to us no line between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.569" offset="15499163">A legislative line can be drawn between them, but I do not think a constitutional line can be drawn between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.992" offset="15520792">It is the -- capital punishment all is different in one other respect, which I would like to come to if I have time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.628" offset="15543362">It is different in that it deters more than any other punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.295" offset="15562066">There are some categories of criminals, who cannot be deterred any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.976" offset="15576694">For example, a man serving life imprisonment and he knows it is a real life term has no incentive not to kill and some have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.707" offset="15619639">A man who has committed an offense, which carries life imprisonment, but is not yet been apprehended has no incentive not to kill to escape with other crimes, except the prospect of a death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.878" offset="15668332">So, that as the ultimate sanction, capital punishment is unique, it is different in the sense that it deters more and thereby saves more innocent lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.033" offset="15724965">And, it is unique in that it upholds the basic values of our society symbolically and internalizes them for us, more than any other punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.412" offset="15758506">So, in its uniqueness, I think it is something that has to weighted in favor of punishment, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.235" offset="15785778">But, I return to my point, I do not think it is unique in the constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.205" offset="15809706">And, in fact the argument for its uniqueness that was made yesterday was that we recognized it was unique, because we surround it by so many precautions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.810" offset="15848054">So, they are procedural safeguards that other punishments do not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.766" offset="15863937">Well, it think that is true, although I do not see why the very existence of precautions makes it unconstitutional, that is what we were told.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.782" offset="15903956">Presumably the same thing would happen if we began to add the same precautions to life imprisonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3983.903" offset="16040420">Apparently, we are told that the only way that they could had a chance is come back with a sweeping mandatory death statute for all kinds of crimes, which would make it not unique, which puts me in a very strange position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.748" offset="16079812">But, I want to say something about the -- I think what I said so far, is sufficient to dispose of this argument that discretion is what makes the statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.461" offset="16118683">I want to say something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.610" offset="16127251">We have been assuming and petitioners' counsel has been assuming that discretion means arbitrariness and capriciousness, in using those incentives, they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.696" offset="16171659">There is really no reason to assume, certainly McGautha did not assume, but certainly our criminal jurisprudence does not assume it is, there is no reason to assume that the men and women, lawyers and judges who man our criminal justice system and the ordinary people who man the grand juries and the petit juries do not take their responsibilities in capital cases seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.751" offset="16255878">And if they do not share and reflect a general, social understanding of when a crime is serious or heinous, petitioners' counsel’s argument really requires him to convince this Court that the more serious the issue, the more capricious would be the jury and that the more standards that are given to a jury, the less they will heed any standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.796" offset="16348038">I think that is a reverse argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.214" offset="16361726">As I said our system of justice, rests upon the thought that people do take their obligations seriously in this system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.221" offset="16389729">McGautha specifically rested upon that point and the evidence suggested that the framers were right to require a jury as a way of eliminating caprice and arbitrariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.124" offset="16441347">We cited the Standford bar view note in our brief, which discusses jury behavior and capital cases and finds irrational, inconsistent pattern.</text>

            <text syncTime="4179.743" offset="16823780">In this goes to the racial bias, as well as any other, because if it is true, that capital punishment is inflicted disproportionately by sex or by race or by social economic group, because of bias not because of other reasons, then and that is not shown around here, then it must also be true that all other punishments are inflicted with equal bias, because it is the same prosecutors, the same jurors, the same people drawn from the same community, same judges, the same governor and I doubt that if we saw a skewing of the system according to some bias that any Court without law all punishments for all crimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4318.236" offset="17377785">The odd thing about this case is the petitioners' counsel argues that if the criminal justice system is too imperfect to permit the death penalty at precisely that moment in our history, when the system has more procedural safeguards than any other time in history of Anglo American law, indeed that is his complain about it, too many safeguards.</text>

            <text syncTime="4458.696" offset="17939626">Mr. Solicitor General, you have now an opportunity to address in your oral argument the issue of the deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.452" offset="17970660">I recognize of course that the statistical data can be construed in various ways and I would agree to this, perhaps not controlling or conclusive, yet, I would invite your attention to some figures and then ask you a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.896" offset="18040459">I have the before me the 1973 report of a Federal Bureau of Investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.435" offset="18074627">It states that in 1968, 15,720 people were murdered in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.980" offset="18112766">In 1973, the latest year reported in this report, 19,510 people were murdered that is an increase of 42%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.513" offset="18166892">In gross numbers that is an increase of 5,790 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.168" offset="18189461">I do not have the more recent figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.913" offset="18200537">I think I have read in a press that they show some slight downward trend.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.728" offset="18227705">It is perfectly obvious from these figures that we need some way to deter the slaughter of Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.145" offset="18261455">I use the word slaughter, because that word was used in connection with the disaster in Vietnam in which 55,000 Americans were killed, over a 6 to 7-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.838" offset="18324149">If the FBI figures are correct, there were more Americans killed in this country, more than there were in the battle fields of Vietnam.</text>

            <text syncTime="4576.400" offset="18410457">Mr. Justice Powell, it seems to me that it cannot rationally be questioned that the death penalty has a deterrent effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.120" offset="18445357">Mankind has always thought that throughout its history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.279" offset="18461971">We know as a matter of common sense and common observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.670" offset="18475554">We know that all other aspects of human behavior as you raise the cost and the risk, the amount of the activity goes down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.627" offset="18507319">I do not know why murder should be any different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.184" offset="18517559">I would have not thought that anybody would have doubted that or listened to a couple of academicians who doubted it and we introduced the Aerlex study and the Yonkers (ph) study, only to show that there is respectable academic evidence on the side of deterrence, but I would have thought that it is common sense and I would thought that in fact, the judgment of the legislatures of this country that they think it deters is enough -- it is irrational judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.896" offset="18616407">I think it is enough for this Court and I must say, at the time when international and domestic terrorism is going up, at a time when brutal murders are going up, it is an awesome responsibility to take from the states, what they think is a necessary deterrence and save a few hundred people and thereby, probably condemn to death, thousands of innocent people, that is truly awesome responsibility.</text>
