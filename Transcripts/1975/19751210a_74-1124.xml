            <text syncTime="34.987" offset="243295">This case involves the legality of a Revenue Ruling, issued by the Internal Revenue Service in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.993" offset="279344">This Revenue Ruling removed the long standing, decades old, free service requirement, which had always been required of charitable hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.922" offset="326991">There was no notice given to anyone when this Ruling issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.155" offset="343919">There was no opportunity given to anyone, to public at large or affected persons to comment upon it or to participate in its development.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.384" offset="384879">The Ruling on its face relied solely upon statements in treatise writer for the law of trust that health per se is charitable.</text>

            <text syncTime="81.833" offset="430645">May I ask, Ms. Rose?</text>
            <text syncTime="83.223" offset="436183">Is it not what you have told us about no hearing and no notice always true about the rulings of this kind?</text>
            <text syncTime="91.345" offset="468679">Has it not historically always been true?</text>

            <label>Ms. Marilyn G. Rose</label>
            <text syncTime="93.643" offset="477874">Well, when the Internal Revenue Service issues Revenue Rulings, they give no notice and opportunity for comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.727" offset="514237">One of the issues is should this have been a Revenue Ruling?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="105.620" stopTime="111.113">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="105.620" offset="525835">Yes, and whether or not the other rulings were rulings of this kind, that is what the question is.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="marilyn_g_rose" startTime="111.113" stopTime="158.494">
            <label>Ms. Marilyn G. Rose</label>
            <text syncTime="111.113" offset="547778">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.657" offset="553943">There were three substantive violations which plaintiffs charge from defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.549" offset="577558">First and foremost, plaintiffs charge that defendants exceeded their statutory authority and in affect amended the Internal Revenue Code when they permitted hospitals as charitable institutions to limit themselves to serving only the paying public.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.444" offset="653104">If the Court decides this issue against plaintiffs, then our second issue is that this indeed, though it was called a Revenue Ruling, which should not have been a Revenue Ruling, it was a substantive rule and defendants were required to proceed in accordance with Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="158.494" offset="737323">Ms. Rose, may I ask you a kind of a preliminary question as to how you plan to structure your argument?</text>
            <text syncTime="163.381" offset="756862">Are you going to discuss a standing at the Anti-Injunction Act and sovereign immunity at the latter part of your argument?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="marilyn_g_rose" startTime="170.903" stopTime="840.410">
            <label>Ms. Marilyn G. Rose</label>
            <text syncTime="170.903" offset="786955">Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.474" offset="809212">The, a third violation, and this again is if the Court rejects both our Internal Revenue Code and 553 Arguments, is that nevertheless there was a violation of Section 706 of the APA that this Ruling was arbitrary and capricious because the defendants would have to have considered factors which they did not consider in the face of the ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.134" offset="927912">And as Mr. Justice Rehnquist indicated, there are jurisdictional issues which the defendants have raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.409" offset="960931">We believe these jurisdictional issues can be best considered and understood in context of the substantive issues, and for that reason we will address the substantive issues first.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.411" offset="1016937">Section 501 (c) (3) and 170 of the Internal Revenue Code has never accorded hospitals tax-exempt status or deduction to the donors to hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.646" offset="1073884">Unlike educational and religious institutions which have their own independent basis, hospitals have had to qualify as charitable institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.808" offset="1114531">For decades, the IRS has required that these charitable hospitals provide either service exclusively to the poor or may provide service to all persons in the community, rich and poor alike, but they may not exclude the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.500" offset="1189345">This is the consistent position of every Tax Court and Federal Court that has considered the issue in the past thirty-three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.108" offset="1223723">There is no case the defendants have cited where a hospital has been accorded 501 (c) (3) status, without there being a finding that a hospital gave free service.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.287" offset="1268444">This indeed is a similar position that IRS takes for all other organizations, which are eligible for these statutory benefits, solely by virtue of being charitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.255" offset="1320376">Every ruling which is cited in the defendant’s brief, every ruling which is cited in the amicus -- American Hospital Association’s brief, and every ruling which we have found and this goes to date till 1975, requires that Institutions which are solely charitable as distinct from being charitable and educational or religious or societies for the prevention of cruelty to children, also must serve all persons in the community rich and poor alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.853" offset="1442733">This is also the position of all state charitable cases or virtually all state charitable cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.956" offset="1471154">The defendants relied simply on a 30-year old statement from Scott on Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.076" offset="1499680">In 1939 as of 1967, the Scott Treatise states that health is charitable per se, but all the cases that professor Scott cites, the tax cases and charitable trust cases, also have this rich and poor alike requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.832" offset="1578674">Indeed the general law of charitable trust going back to England and more ancient times has always considered that there are four heads of the charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.420" offset="1617022">Charity is either for the relief of the poor, educational, religious, or there is a fourth head, and this fourth head of things beneficial to the community, but things beneficial to the community must provide service to all persons of the community, again rich and poor alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.538" offset="1693509">This beneficial to the community does not permit that the exclusion of the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.489" offset="1717332">The defendants argue that the Treasury Regulation, which issued in 1959, permitted them to make this change; that is absolutely untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.880" offset="1770831">The Treasury Regulation, which issued in 1959, is an expansion statement on what is the law on charitable, but it was brought in to include new purposes such as combating discrimination, juvenile delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.417" offset="1845019">But there is nothing on the face of the Ruling of the 1959 Regulation nor is there anything in its published history to indicate that there was a change and charitable organizations may serve only the paying public.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.327" offset="1916594">In 1969, the American Hospital Association appealed to Congress to make a change and give hospitals independent status.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.470" offset="1953166">This change was rejected, it was in the House Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.408" offset="1968944">The Senate Finance Committee in October of 1969, considered the issue and the Senate Finance Committee deleted the House Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.493" offset="2009277">The statement for deleting this House Amendment took into account the fact that three weeks earlier, the Internal Revenue Service had issued to Revenue Ruling that is issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.047" offset="2059536">But the Senate Finance Committee stated flatly that they were removing this provision, that the Revenue Ruling in issue in this case did not conform to the Internal Revenue Code, and they want to consider the proposal in context that is implications on health legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.797" offset="2130485">I think it is clear that the Congress need not conform the statute to an administrative action, but administrators are bound to conform their actions to a legislative enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.107" offset="2183775">The Court below recognized the judicial, administrative and legislative history are discussed, but they went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.217" offset="2216167">They said that this need not always be the case, that defendants could take into account socio-economic changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.731" offset="2246260">They also made a statement, that the so-called requirement of emergency service in the Revenue Ruling, maybe of greater beneficial value to the poor than general hospital services, including in-patient here.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.773" offset="2314387">That -- those socio-economic findings are legally infirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.008" offset="2339360">There is nothing on the face of the Revenue Ruling to indicate whatsoever that any of these matters were taken into account by defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.866" offset="2378753">The Appellate counsel in this case in the Court of Appeals below, and in the Supreme Court, is making this proffering, this argument, but that is -- should be rejected as the Court of Appeal’s decision should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.534" offset="2437476">I think there are many cases of this Court that have stated flatly, that the post-talk rationalization of Appellate counsel cannot substitute for the reason that the Administrative Agency used.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.881" offset="2486900">And the Administrative Agency used solely Scott on Trust, and Scott in Trust has said the same thing, I had this one sentence upon which they rely since 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.713" offset="2530159">And in 1939 and through the 1940s, and through the 1950s, and through the 1960s, ye, in the summer of 1969 Internal Revenue Service was still going at the hospitals that refused to serve the poor and poor have to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.656" offset="2594002">It is also factually infirm because of the limitations of time, I will not go into all the details.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.371" offset="2628797">Our brief in Chief, and the brief of the American Public Health Association extensively discussed as why it is factually infirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.203" offset="2664114">In some, HEW, which is the health expert agency in this country finds there are over twenty-three million people in this country with incomes of below the poverty guidelines, and at that time the poverty guidelines was something like $4,400 a year for a family of four.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.359" offset="2732764">That these upwards of twenty-three million people have neither private not public health insurance, and when we say that we are including Medicaid; Medicaid is a very limited program in terms of eligibility for income and services, it does not take care of the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.837" offset="2790652">The health policy of the United States has continued to require the free service be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.983" offset="2819282">The Halliburton program of HEW requires a free service be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.687" offset="2838090">Title XVI of the new Health Planning Act, December 1974, Congress specifically said that until there is -- there will be a national, or if there will be national health insurance program there is still a need to serve everyone of the community to serve the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.747" offset="2910292">The defendants have made a large argument that this Ruling does not deprive from the service to the poor that there is an emergency room requirement in the Ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.165" offset="2951984">We disagree in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.609" offset="2961806">First, they argue as if the emergency room has now become like a private doctor’s office.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.913" offset="2995034">General physician services do not exist in emergency room.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.247" offset="3012274">The Ruling, secondly on its face talks not about general emergency room services, it talks about a dire emergency and that a hospital cannot turn away somebody in a dire emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.303" offset="3060549">And thirdly, there is no requirement that people not be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.960" offset="3075177">The most they can say for this Ruling is that people will not be required to put up money upfront to pay a pre-service admission if they come into an emergency room, they are in a dire emergency, maybe bleeding to death, there is no free service requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.117" offset="3151768">Turning now to our Section 553 of the APA argument, which this Court need not reach if they accept our primary argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.929" offset="3191056">The Internal Revenue Service does not deny that it is an Agency subject to 553 and it cannot make such a denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.947" offset="3219164">It says this Ruling was interpretive.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.868" offset="3238808">We say that the Internal Revenue Service is mislabeling this Ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.836" offset="3258661">This Ruling on its face has to be substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.969" offset="3271200">In our principal brief, we have come up with what I would call a functional test, that the lower federal courts have increasing in recent areas looked behind the label and have said, is the rule a policy of an agency, general long standing, is it a revision of a long standing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.855" offset="3346746">Is there a need for an agency to expedite -- to educate itself?</text>
            <text syncTime="815.773" offset="3366390">What is the impact upon an industry?</text>
            <text syncTime="818.781" offset="3378407">What is the impact upon the public?</text>
            <text syncTime="820.847" offset="3386766">In everyone of these cases, here is a major revision done without notice, without an opportunity for comment by an agency that knows virtually nothing about healthcare, ignoring what the healthcare agency of United States is doing, let alone what organizations like the American Public Health Association would do.</text>

            <text syncTime="846.090" offset="3487703">Well I do not think, I would Mr. Chief Justice, that I do not know if this Court knows more about it but -- and I also do not know if the Court of Appeals might know more about it, but these on -- what the Court of Appeals did is they made findings, they made findings without a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.066" offset="3555621">They have reached out and sustained this Ruling in the same way as if there was an attack on congressional statute for being unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.431" offset="3593029">The fact is this the Court of Appeals should have looked simply as to what reason that was used by the Agency, Scott on Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.185" offset="3624062">If they did not looked at that, they have reached out and made socio-economic analysis, they were going beyond their power and or their -- so, with all this Court I think what this argument has to determine is that this is the kind of thing, there should have been hearing on.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.108" offset="3711729">The alternatively if the Court finds -- feels a definitial test is the proper one, an interpretive rule is one that is limited to determination of congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.445" offset="3757078">A substantive rule is one which augments congressional purpose and goes beyond the statute, it goes outside the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.774" offset="3786439">In this test too, this is a substantive rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.867" offset="3798769">I will not go into our alternative Section 706 of the APA argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.952" offset="3823115">I think it is clear that the only way the defendants feel that the Ruling could be sustained is they had to make the socio-economic argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.872" offset="3854776">It is not on the rule -- it is not on the face of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.049" offset="3863553">The Agency did not consider it, and therefore, all relevant were not conceded and as citizens to preserve over to the park all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.454" offset="3897199">I would like to turn to the jurisdictional arguments that defendants have proffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.576" offset="3917679">Defendants have not come up with what is a variety of jurisdictional barriers to plaintiffs sustaining -- maintaining this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.433" offset="3961042">Their first argument is an attack upon the rules laid down by this court in Abbot Laboratories and all other cases like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.869" offset="4002838">It is an attack upon the presumptive reviewability of agency action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.454" offset="6109143">The government’s position in this case simply is that published Revenue Rulings, such as the Revenue Ruling at issue here, do not present any issue for a Federal Court to review and in that holding to the contrary the decision of the Court of Appeals is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.137" offset="6179883">And before discussing in detail, the various jurisdictional barriers that we think exist in this suit, I think it would be important for the Court to have before it what the essential nature of a Revenue Ruling is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.447" offset="6237143">Because in our view that essential nature demonstrates that the jurisdictional holding of the District of Columbia Circuit in this case would require the Federal Courts to render judgments in the most abstract contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.030" offset="6291478">Now, each year the Internal Revenue Service, pursuant to its statutory authority under Section 7805 of the code, issues some forty-thousand advanced letter rulings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.718" offset="6946211">In any event, these Revenue Rulings, these contribute to uniformity of interpretation and in our view contribute to the stability of the tax law by reducing controversies between the Internal Revenue Service and taxpayers because as I think the Court is well aware, taxpayers, many taxpayers do not like to litigate with the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.908" offset="7026981">They would prefer to have an advance notice of what its position might be on a particular set of facts, and this educational program increases stability and reduces litigation and the intended burdens on the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.604" offset="7081734">Now, the format of the Ruling, of a Revenue Ruling is essentially a statement of facts and it is often abbreviated with a brief conclusion as to what the federal tax consequences of those facts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.256" offset="7132307">And the important thing is that the Internal Revenue Service does abbreviate a Revenue -- the facts in publishing a Revenue Ruling, because when a taxpayer makes a submission to the Internal Revenue Service, he makes a submission with a voluminous statement of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.972" offset="7195210">But the Internal Revenue Service when it -- if it may select this particular letter ruling for publication, it will boil this down and essentially present the statement of facts which is designed to illustrate a particular legal principle that it feels as of general interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.360" offset="7456748">Now, this Ruling itself demonstrates the hypothetical quality of what the plaintiffs are seeking -- or hypothetical quality of the relief they are seeking, because as the Court can readily see in perusing this Revenue Ruling, it sets forth two polar situations, situation one and situation two dealing with two hospitals, hospital (a) and hospital (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.606" offset="7565731">Hospital (a) there are variety of facts in connection with -- hospital (a) has an open Board of Trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.742" offset="7598332">It gives open staff privileges.</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.264" offset="7632395">It maintains a full-time emergency room and no one requiring emergency care is denied treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.112" offset="7659772">To the contrary, hospital (b) is almost proprietary in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.706" offset="7678162">It is owned by a small group of doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.460" offset="7689133">They limit the staff of privileges to people they know and they comprise the medical committee generally to keep out qualified physicians, so etcetera-etcetera and it does not have -- it maintains an emergency room, but basically to treat the patients of its own doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.934" offset="7775024">Now, these two polar examples were designed to educate the public generally and hospital administrators as to clear-cut situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.648" offset="7821940">Hospital (a) is a situation, if you like hospital (a), you will be -- you will be fairly certain of exemption, but of course the Ruling does conclude that you cannot be certain of that itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.081" offset="7871677">You have got to yourself submit an application for exemption to the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.636" offset="7889858">If you like hospital (b), which is a polar example of hospital that does not seem to provide any community benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.378" offset="7912846">It seems to be run pretty much strictly for the private inurnment of its owner-doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.641" offset="7937923">In those situation -- in that situation you are not going to get a tax exempt status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.504" offset="7961329">Now, the important thing, which we emphasize, is that the Ruling does not even begin to attempt to deal with the hundreds of gradations in between hospital (a) and hospital (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.687" offset="8018067">Hospital (a) assuming for a moment that -- that it does not treat people -- that does not give free care to the indigents on a broad scale, although let us say it dropped its emergency room requirement -- emergency room completely for let us say the particular example that it may be engaged in treating cancer patients or a particular kind of decease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.425" offset="8117019">Under those circumstances an emergency room would be relatively -- would be superfluous because such a hospital would rarely have need for an emergency room or for example a consortium of hospitals in a particularly community could get together and one could say, we will have the emergency room, you have the nursing school, and the third --</text>
