            <label>Mr. David A. Lang</label>
            <text syncTime="15.208" offset="166228">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.573" offset="171662">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.546" offset="179498">My name is David Lang and I am the counsel for the petitioner in this case, Charles Hampton, Jr.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.537" offset="199560">This case is before this Court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.621" offset="219831">That Court affirmed a judgment a jury verdict finding, the defendant guilty of two counts of distributing heroin in violation of Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.364" offset="258806">The facts of this case are as follows: Petitioner Charles Hampton was initially charged in a two-count indictment with violation of Section 84191 of Title 21 of the United States Code, with knowingly and intentionally distributing approximately three grams of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.009" offset="337382">At the trial, the government introduced testimony of five witnesses in this case in chief and three witnesses in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.944" offset="365177">Only three of the government’s witnesses’ testimonies are presently before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.679" offset="384089">Hampton likewise also introduced the testimony of five witnesses including himself, and only his testimony appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.211" offset="414182">Basically, without, to think the facts are fairly well set out in the brief, but just to give some background on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.580" offset="443648">Basically, the government’s first witness was a Jules Hutton who was a special employee of the Drug Enforcement Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.309" offset="478548">He testified that he had been involved in some 80 or 90 drug cases in Wichita, Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas and St. Louis area.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.471" offset="511253">He had just gotten into St. Louis and his job was to make contact with the persons who were involved in drug trafficking and to set up sales with agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.855" offset="572798">He testified that in business that he was approached by the defendant Hampton who initiated the scheme for selling drugs, and basically there were two sales that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.877" offset="628909">One occurred on February 25, 1974; the other occurred on February 26, the following day.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.238" offset="662346">The first sale took place and at that sale a second sale was set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.731" offset="692334">On date of the following sale February 26, the sale was consummated and the two persons who purchased the drugs then identified themselves as being Federal Narcotics Agents and placed, both the defendant and Jules Hutton, the informant, under arrest at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.961" offset="757222">That was basically the story that was given by Hutton.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.045" offset="769552">Now, the contradiction came in with respect Hampton’s testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.216" offset="790241">His testimony was basically that all of the drug transactions were initiated not be himself but by Hutton, the government’s informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.425" offset="827022">He has further testified that at no time did any of the substances which he sale -- rather all the substances which he sold had been supplied to him by Hutton.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.128" offset="865892">That he had no independent source of supply of these drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.799" offset="880520">The question basically was a question of credibility between the two witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.421" offset="903090">At the trial, we moved for a special jury entrapment, a special jury instruction on the defense of entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.984" offset="929317">This was based upon the so-called government conduct theory of entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.036" offset="949484">And the focus of that theory is that one does not focus of course upon the predisposition of the defendant but rather upon the extent of the governmental participation in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.540" offset="995564">The District Court refused to give the requested instruction on the ground that this Court’s opinion in United States versus Russell precluded any entrapment defense based upon any principle other than predisposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.467" offset="1047182">The Court of Appeals affirmed that decision on the ground that it felt it was also precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.109" offset="1065781">There was one dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.137" offset="1073931">Therefore the basic issue is whether the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment forbids the conviction of an accused for selling contraband if the contraband was supplied to him by an agent acting in behalf of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.368" offset="1146865">Previous opinions of this Court starting with Sorrells and culminating with the Russell decision in 1973, we believe not to reach the specific issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.392" offset="1190959">We believe this issue neither was nor reached in Russell and Russell is distinguishable and this is a totally different situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.545" offset="1251564">That is correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.960" offset="1257206">There had been a number of cases in which this precise issue has been raised both in State Court cases and Federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.439" offset="1283119">Prior to this Court’s decision in Russell, every Court that it passed on the issue of contraband being supplied to the defendant and that was subject of the offense had ruled that that constituted entrapment as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.802" offset="1336618">Now a careful analysis of those cases I believe, the courts used various languages.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.197" offset="1358143">Some cases use the term entrapment; some cases -- the Court did not specify what exactly, what doctrine they were purporting to utilize on those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.521" offset="1395446">I think this cases can best be analyzed if they are viewed a due process cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.781" offset="1420524">And --</text>

            <text syncTime="329.022" offset="1421464">I understand that no specific entrapment instruction was requested of Judge Meredith?</text>

            <text syncTime="336.293" offset="1450512">This was Judge Nangle.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.667" offset="1460021">We did not request the traditional predisposition entrapment instruction; that is correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.491" offset="1483322">We only requested this so-called government conduct, theory of entrapment or whatever one wants to term it.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.587" offset="1511743">The reason for that in this particular instance was that the offense was knowingly and intentionally distributing heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.264" offset="1546434">So the issue of scienter was already before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.736" offset="1560331">If they believe that this defendant never knew he was distributing heroin, they had ample ground to find form on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.771" offset="1588439">We did not feel that we should confuse the jury with another predisposition issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.521" offset="1603485">In other words, the issue of scienter goes to both predisposition and knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="389.475" offset="1663253">But as I say it was strategic move at that point not to confuse the jury by bringing in this predisposition when if they believe the defendant’s testimony, they would necessarily have acquitted him on the grounds that he did not know that he was distributing heroin, because all along he thought the substance he was distributing was a counterfeit substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.189" offset="1734097">That was the story that had been given to him by the informant.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.545" offset="1871502">Would that not be the next step providing the marked money to buy, which does much of obtent (ph) in the transaction in the government’s role as providing the contraband to sell?</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Lang</label>
            <text syncTime="458.952" offset="1941196">No, Your Honor and I will answer that by approaching it this way, I like to approach it by stating it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.036" offset="1973484">When the government supplies contraband to a defendant, it is necessarily assuming that this man has some criminal propensity that he is going to commit and offense involving the contraband in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.609" offset="2023848">There is an implicit presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.856" offset="2032834">That is the only presumption that can justify supply and contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.307" offset="2046626">If the man does not want to sell contraband in the government has no right to test him or to aid him under the traditional doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.276" offset="2082466">So there is a finding; there is a necessary relied on presumption when the contraband is supplied that he was going to sell it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.768" offset="2108484">He was going to get his own source of the contraband and sell it.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.547" offset="2123531">When they supply the money, is there not just as realistic notion that he is familiar with the ways of the drug traffic and that he is going to use the money?</text>

            <text syncTime="525.077" offset="2205660">I am saying that there is a distinct difference between contraband first of all because an item has been labeled contraband by Congress, there should be a presumption that that item is not generally revealed that is why it is contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.459" offset="2259159">Indeed, Congress is trying to keep it off the street, which if taken hypothetical for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.692" offset="2280161">Let us say, someone wants to make a time bomb and let us assume that a necessary element in a time bomb is a clock or some type of time-keeping device.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.721" offset="2316210">If the government provide it, a clock I will have no problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.238" offset="2330316">It is necessary but we can assume that the defendant can go out and purchase a clock anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.094" offset="2349751">It does not have to be supplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.627" offset="2355916">I am saying we cannot necessary, as a matter of logic, make that inference when the contraband is supplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.977" offset="2377232">It does not necessarily follow that contraband is available just because one has a predisposition to want to engage in a contraband crime that he would be able to get contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.349" offset="2422790">There was no evidence in this case that the defendant had any source of heroin other than the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.329" offset="2446718">That was never brought at trial what his source of the supply was.</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Lang</label>
            <text syncTime="591.428" offset="2471064">Well, I am saying Your Honor, certainly at some point when a crime is committed, there is always predisposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.887" offset="2492902">We are talking about a consummated criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.665" offset="2503978">When the act was consummated, certainly, his predisposition was one element what one calls as a criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.598" offset="2527802">Another element was the inducement by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.149" offset="2537937">There is another element that caused a consummated act was supply of the contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.070" offset="2553611">All of these things caused factually the consummated criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.396" offset="2570956">Now, I am saying that the bigger question, if we look the fact of the sale of the contraband is saying he was predisposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.531" offset="2599482">Yes, assuming he was predisposed and does not necessarily follow that he could have gotten contraband from any of his source.</text>

            <text syncTime="663.955" offset="2761232">First of all, it was clear in that case that the defendant had a source of propanone both before and after it was supplied by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.707" offset="2792161">Secondly, that was a crime involving manufacture of “speed”, and manufacturing involved some type of affirmative action on part of the person engaging in crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.688" offset="2828106">You just do not take this substance assuming indispensable, that does create a crime in and of itself, he had to do something actively to be guilty of manufacturing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="1335.929" offset="5449128">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.998" offset="5461353">This here in this case as Mr. Lang stated is whether to say per se denial of due process to convict the defendant for the sale of narcotics that he procured from the informant or government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.079" offset="5517673">There is a conflict among the Courts of Appeals on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.467" offset="5531257">United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held that for an informant or government agent supplies a defendant with narcotics for which the -- for the sale of which the defendant is subsequently arrested and indicted, the defendant is immune from prosecution for that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.823" offset="5608684">Now without regard to any of the surrounding circumstances including the fact that the defendant may have been predisposed to deal in the cons of narcotics for which he was arrested for selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.089" offset="5653719">The Court of Appeals below, the Eighth Circuit, rejected this per se test and held that the petitioner in this case was properly convicted, notwithstanding the fact that he might have procured his heroin here from a government informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.954" offset="5713173">Because of the importance of this issue to the administration under narcotics laws, the United States acquiesced in the granting of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.630" offset="5751835">AT the outset, I would like to briefly recapitulate the relevant facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.993" offset="5773359">I think there are four of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.860" offset="5780778">First, the petitioner did make two sales of heroin to government undercover agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.072" offset="5809617">Second, it has now been established that the petitioner knew at the time he was making the sales that the substance he was selling was heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.612" offset="5847861">Third, it is unquestioned that the petitioner was introduced to the government undercover agents by an informant who described them as potential narcotics buyers, and fourth, it was also established by petitioner’s counsel in the Court of Appeals, the petitioner was at all relevant times predisposed to deal on heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.370" offset="5942842">Some of the remaining facts are still controverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.007" offset="5957366">In particular, the petitioner testified a trial that it was the informant who originated the scheme of selling heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.918" offset="5989026">Whereas the informant testified to the contrary that the scheme originated with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.575" offset="6011701">The petitioner also testified that he obtained his heroin from the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.335" offset="6034688">The informant denied this and testified that he had no knowledge concerning the petitioner’s source of heroin.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1489.019" offset="6061438">But none of these things are really important or material to the basic question in this case, is it Mr. Jones?</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.246" offset="6086306">Is it not the question only whether or not the instructions, set out on Page 9 of petitioner’s brief, then was required?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="1503.922" stopTime="1589.326">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="1503.922" offset="6121102">That is correct and I would like to read that instruction just for the benefit of the Court so we will know exactly what we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.575" offset="6155688">The petitioner requested instruction at trial as follows: “If you find that the defendant sales of narcotics or sales in narcotics supplied to him by an informer and he employ of or acting on behalf of the government, and you must have acquit the defendant, because the law, as a matter of policy, forbids his conviction in such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.119" offset="6241787">Furthermore, under this particular defense, we need not consider the predisposition of the defendant to commit the offense charge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.117" offset="6281807">Under this instruction if the jury had concluded that the petitioner had in fact obtained the heroin that he sold from the government informant and it would have been required to acquit petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.812" offset="6328618">And this would have been true no matter what other kinds of findings the jury might have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.591" offset="6347740">For example, if the jury had concluded that petitioner was an established heroin dealer with many sources of supply of heroin who had originated the scheme of selling heroin and in fact demanded heroin from the informant as a sign of good faith or as a means of involving the informant in a criminal transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.910" offset="6424958">Nevertheless, the jury would have been required to acquit the petitioner if it found that in fact the informant did comply with the demand, did furnish the contraband in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.561" offset="6495593">The informant denied that he furnished the heroin, so that the matter is in dispute and the jury made no finding on that point.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1610.223" offset="6546271">But you originally spend a good deal a few minutes talking about the dispute and in fact, that has nothing to be with the basic issue in this case.</text>

          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="1617.191" stopTime="1747.050">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="1617.191" offset="6574169">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.996" offset="6577304">I only wanted to point out to the Court that what is involved here is a dispute matter and if the Court decided that the instruction should have been given, of course, the proper relief would be a new trial, because that question is in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.709" offset="6636236">I would like first to describe the relationship that the petitioners proposed due process defense bears to the standard defensive entrapment and then I will elaborate a greater length upon the reasons for rejecting that or any similar defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.899" offset="6712932">The availability of the traditional defense of entrapment turns upon a question of predisposition, i.e., it turns upon the question that whether the defendant, at the time of the alleged entrapment, was predisposed to commit the kind of offense for which he did in fact commit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.405" offset="6782940">Now the petitioner here has conceded that he was predisposed to commit the heroin offense with which he was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.684" offset="6812093">And he has not attempted to assert the traditional defense of entrapment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.576" offset="6835707">But the defense that he does assert bears a strong resemblance to an entrapment defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.844" offset="6860785">The proper scope and correct formulation of the defense of entrapment has been much mooted by the members of this Court over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.386" offset="6898924">In the United States against Russell, three members of the present Court expressed the view that the defensive entrapment should turn not upon the subjective factor of the defendant’s predisposition or rather upon the objective consideration of the particular law enforcement conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.265" offset="6970395">The entrapment test propounded by the minority in Russell was whether the government’s conduct -- and I quote here -- “whether the government’s conduct is of a kind that could induce or instigate the commission of a crime by one not ready and willing to commit it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.550" offset="7031521">Now we think it is fairly clear that that test would not avail petitioner in this case either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.182" offset="7054091">What he seeks is recognition of an absolute defense based upon the presence of a single alleged fact the provision of heroin by an informant.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="1773.847" offset="7200795">It is not in the Seventh either where the McGrath decision applied Russell and the context in a similar context to preclude an absolute defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.041" offset="7245516">But we feel that an informant’s offer to supply heroin to an individual simply not the kind of offer, not the kind of law enforcement activity but is likely to induce an otherwise innocent law abiding individual to enter the Narcotics Trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.310" offset="7322630">It is simply not the kind of objective law enforcement conduct that is likely to turn an innocent individual into the path of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.196" offset="7358156">This kind of offer, this kind of law enforcement conduct, may prove useful on apprehending criminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.901" offset="7385010">But it poses little or no risk by itself of trapping unwary innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.519" offset="7407475">We therefore think that under either view of the proper scope of the entrapment test, petitioner was not entrapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.614" offset="7439867">But indeed the petitioner seems to concede as much in this case because he has repeatedly characterized this is not an entrapment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.244" offset="7474349">But this concession, this acknowledgment that this is not a case of entrapment creates for petitioner what appears to be an insoluble paradox.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.931" offset="7517085">The due process test that he advocates is analogous to the test advocated by the minority in Russell and that each of those tests focuses on the conduct of the government agents, but whereas the minorities test in Russell entailed an evaluation of the governmental conduct in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.459" offset="7595244">The test proposed by petitioner focuses exclusively on a single aspect of that conduct, the furnishing of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.481" offset="7627322">His contention is that an informant’s supply of narcotics to a suspect for controlled resale to government agents is somehow shocking an offensive per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.214" offset="7678208">But, as I have just indicated, that kind of law enforcement conducts standing alone carries so little risk of inveigling an innocent law-abiding individual into crime, that it does not even constitute entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.502" offset="7735364">Almost by definition therefore, the governmental furnishing of narcotics is not shocking and offensive in any sense that pertains to the essential concerns underlying the entrapment doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.161" offset="7786042">It is not shocking and offensive that it is in any sense that pertains to the values underlying the traditional defense of entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.998" offset="7817389">The paradox is that those are exactly the values and concerns adduce by petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.661" offset="7844034">Those are the only concerns he raises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.575" offset="7859707">The only kind of complaint that he makes about the governmental conduct here is that it is the kind of conduct -- and quote here from this Court Sherman decision -- “The place on the weaknesses of an innocent party, beguiles him into committing crimes which he otherwise would not have committed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.334" offset="7930656">This is not a kind of case like Rochin against California where other kinds of due process values are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.275" offset="7958450">In that case, the value was the protection of the citizenry against governmental brutality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.774" offset="7980497">Nothing of that kind is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.124" offset="7989902">Petitioners only claim is that he was unfairly assisted in his own criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.889" offset="8008919">That is a claim that smacks solely and simply of entrapment addressed in this case in due process clothing simply to conceal petitioner’s own criminal predisposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.805" offset="8052595">Now these considerations suggest to us that an allegation of governmental furnishing of narcotics is merely one factor to be considered in connection with the standard defense of entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.634" offset="8099929">Such an allegation should not be treated as giving rise to a separate and preclusive due process defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.274" offset="8130440">Now we would of course concede that in some hypothetical circumstances, the governmental furnishing of narcotics could be part of a course of law enforcement conduct that, considered in its entirety, might entail the entrapment of an innocent individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.103" offset="8201807">But our point here is that an allegation of such governmental furnishing by itself in essence raises only a partial claim of entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.086" offset="8241722">And it is such a claim must be rejected if the other requisites of an entrapment defense are lacking, and those requisites are lacking here and we think that disposes the petitioner’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.796" offset="8296579">With this much said however, I would now turn to a closer analysis of petitioner’s specific contention that somehow the governmental provision of narcotics to a suspect for controlled resale is shocking to the universal sense of justice, shocking to the conscience of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.106" offset="8389784">Of necessity, the application of a due process test, such as this, depends on large measure upon the individual subjective judgments of the members of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.679" offset="8440044">But we believe that, to the extent that analysis and experience may be brought to bear in making these judgments, that the governmental conduct alleged here cannot be viewed as so outrageous -- and I quote here from the majority opinion in Russell -- “cannot be viewed as so outrageous that due process principles would absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.116" offset="8553833">Our submission on this point is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.637" offset="8567939">First, as an analytical matter we see no constitutionally significant difference between the providing of narcotics alleged by petitioner here and the furnishing of other indispensable means of committing crime, such as the phenol 2-propanone that was supplied to the defendants in United States against Russell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.434" offset="8655084">Second, as a matter of law enforcement experience, we are concerned that the adoption of a per se due process rule of the kind advocated by petitioner, could seriously hamper enforcement of the narcotics laws, and I will discuss these two pointes in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.419" offset="8731048">First, as an analytical matter, the only distinction between the heroin allegedly supplied the petitioner here and the phenol 2-propanone supplied in Russell is that heroin is contraband whereas phenol 2-propanone is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.713" offset="8792174">That is the only distinction we see and that is the only distinction that the petitioner has suggested.</text>

            <text syncTime="2192.533" offset="8875453">The whole point is that what is criminal is selling the contraband.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="2200.106" offset="8905755">Well, once again, the distinction between contraband and an alarm clock or the distinction from contraband and phenol 2-propenone is that one is illegal and the other legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.053" offset="8949536">But regrettably, regrettably there is no distinction between the two as to the relative obtainability of the two substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.552" offset="8991541">That seems to us is the crux of petitioner’s submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.452" offset="9007214">He claims that one substance is obtainable and the other is not, but that is simply not the as phenol 2-propenone was difficult to obtain, but it was obtainable and the same may be a set of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.741" offset="9068341">Indeed, it is very likely true that heroin is more readily obtainable, more easily obtained by persons familiar with our narcotics trade, such as petitioner, than is phenol 2-propenone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.041" offset="9121526">Petitioner by his own admission in this case was testified that he had had no difficulty in obtaining heroin in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.070" offset="9153604">He was an acknowledged heroin addict and he had had contact with heroin with the four months preceding his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.323" offset="9186623">We quote on Page 4 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.340" offset="9202715">Petitioner’s admission that “The heroin I have seen since I have been back since I have been out of the penitentiary has been brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.712" offset="9236256">Before that it was usually white, white powdery flower-like substance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.202" offset="9254124">So that heroin was obtainable by him, he had familiarity with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.235" offset="9278261">Since the distinction between the heroin here and lawful substances that may also be indispensable elements and crime does not bear upon obtainability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.842" offset="9328729">We think it has no constitutional force here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.125" offset="9341895">Heroin was otherwise obtainable by petitioner and he, by his own admission, was predisposed to commit heroin offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.316" offset="9374600">He was willing to commit such offenses and he was able to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.358" offset="9390796">The governmental conduct alleged here, was therefore nothing more than the simple provision of the opportunities and facilities for the commission of a particular crime of a type with which the petitioner was willing and able to commit, and that is the kind of governmental law enforcement conduct that has long been sanctioned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.728" offset="9476269">As to the law enforcement experience and the wisdom that it can provide in this case, we do feel as I have suggested earlier that adoption of a per se rule might seriously hamper enforcement of the narcotics laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.333" offset="9554741">And this is so for two different kinds of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.370" offset="9574803">First, governmental furnishing of contraband may in some circumstances be necessary to effective law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.487" offset="9611270">Now this obviously is not a wholly happy state of affairs but neither is the fact of substantial narcotics trade in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.642" offset="9659962">The fact that governmental furnishing of narcotics sometimes is necessary to catch narcotic criminals is a fact, and it is one that we think must be squarely faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.308" offset="9706564">This Court in its much recognized fact in Russell, Court observed that the infiltration of drug rings and a limited participation in their unlawful activities is one of the only practical means of detecting narcotics criminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.749" offset="9776364">We think that that consideration does play some part here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.769" offset="9800396">As we indicated in our brief, this is not a common law enforcement practice, that it is not common for the government, qua government to provide narcotics, but we think that when it does occur it is not shocking and offensive per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.185" offset="9862150">Secondly, we are perhaps more concerned that a due process rule of the kind urged by petitioner would lead to acquittals in circumstances where the government’s conduct, qua government was completely innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.882" offset="9924844">In some cases for example, a narcotics carrier may become an informant and may reveal to the government the identity of the individuals to whom he makes deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.849" offset="9972804">Under the rule adapted in the Fifth Circuit and under the instruction offered by petitioners here, the government would be barred from prosecuting those individuals and that is a result which seems to us to be manifestly improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.929" offset="10033095">The government has done absolutely nothing at all offensive or in any way unfair in circumstance such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.131" offset="10061934">We see absolutely no reason to bar prosecution of such narcotics criminals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2553.762" offset="10320442">One kind of situation in which governmental furnishing of contraband might well be offensive is, for example, where the Congress had outlawed the possession of a particular kind of military weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.022" offset="10377493">And such weapons were not in private possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.099" offset="10393794">And the government through undercover agents offered to furnish a defendant such a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.263" offset="10418453">I think that his possession in such a case may well not be subject to prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.377" offset="10438829">But I would make one more point which bears upon why we think that a rule like this is inadvisable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.489" offset="10475296">In many situations, the government simply has no knowledge whatsoever of where the defendant obtained the narcotics or the other contraband that he is accused of selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.711" offset="10520226">In such cases, the government will have no affirmative evidence with which to rebut a claim that the supplier was an informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.146" offset="10557947">But more than that, there may well be situations in which the supplier was in fact an informant but was acting without the knowledge or sanction of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.066" offset="10609670">That is it may well be the case sometimes that an individual involved in a drug trade will also be doubling as an informant and will sometimes tip-off the government as to the activities of some of his associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.826" offset="10672677">And we feel that the fact that the defendant obtained narcotics from an informant who was acting illegally without the knowledge or approval of the government, plainly does not warrant a due process defense that would bar prosecution and conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.255" offset="10734431">In short, we think that the ordinary rules of entrapment amply protect the unwary innocent in circumstances such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.460" offset="10767240">And then no additional protection should be afforded the unwary criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.779" offset="10784481">The due process rule advocated by petitioner here would do just that it would afford additional protection to the unwary criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.317" offset="10814679">We think that this Court should reject that per se due process rule and affirm the judgment below.</text>

            <text syncTime="2716.414" offset="10970995">The distinction tends to break down in a middle gray area, because the informant here for example did receive a per diem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2882.039" offset="11633565">Secondly, Mr. Jones mentioned that there might have situation where one is acting -- one might be engaged in criminal enterprise, let us say, involved in drugs and he decides that he does want to be an informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.907" offset="11688945">And since the word that I have used, he wants to turn state evidence for his benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.371" offset="11706813">Well, I am saying certainly, in that instance there would be no bar of persecution to the defendant who is charged because the government has not supplied any contraband there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.309" offset="11754564">We are not going to simply say this was a supply of contraband because this person has changed his status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.066" offset="11773582">Those cases would not be affected at all by the standards that were urged.</text>

            <label>Mr. David A. Lang</label>
            <text syncTime="2922.010" offset="11793435">Now, another thing that was mentioned here had to do with the question of indispensable means versus contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.961" offset="11837216">And Mr. Jones used the term indispensable means and said that that was involved in the Hampton case here that the indispensable means were provided to this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.468" offset="11887266">Well, I do not think that indispensable means is the correct terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.484" offset="11907328">I think there is a distinction between providing something such as a clock in the hypothetical I gave or the propanone in Russell case which were necessary and contraband per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.733" offset="11952259">In the Russell case, the offense was manufacturing “speed” and in that particular instance, yes it was necessary to have propanone to do that but it also requires some further active affirmative action on the part of defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.065" offset="12013595">He had to take that ingredient that was given and mix it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.883" offset="12028850">There is the evidence of real predisposition such as I have no problem within informer that he would have done it anyway and also we have, as I indicated before, the fact that he did have his own propanone both before and after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.598" offset="12079737">Here we do not have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.196" offset="12086111">If I can go back to my original argument or my chief argument involving statutory presumptions, the proven fact in this case is that Hampton sold heroin, and yes it is true that from that one can logically infer that he was predispose to sell heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.966" offset="12153193">I have not problems with that, fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.895" offset="12160925">But assuming that he was predisposed does then follow as a matter of logic or rationality that despite his predisposition he would have sold heroin, had the government not supplied him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.910" offset="12208991">I say we do not know that; I say we certainly do not know that beyond the reasonable doubt, and I say that we cannot say that beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.952" offset="12237203">The Due Process Clause forbids conviction of any defendant in these circumstances.</text>
