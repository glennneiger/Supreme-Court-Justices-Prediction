            <text syncTime="10.176" offset="114328">The case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.221" offset="154556">The District Court held that certain black applicants from employment as over-the-road truck drivers, were in violation of Title VII, discriminatorily denied jobs, on the basis of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.609" offset="232088">However in fashioning relief, the District Court denied relief in the form of seniority status retroactive to the dates of individual applications for the over-the-road positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.052" offset="305857">And the Court of Appeals from the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.083" offset="321949">We reverse and we hold that an award of seniority retroactive to the date of the individual job application is appropriate under section 706 (g) of Title VII, which, to effectuate Title VII's objective of making persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination, because merely to require the employer to hire the victim of discrimination falls far short of a "make whole" remedy, and a concomitant award of the seniority credit, he presumptively would have earned, but for the wrongful treatment is also necessary absent of course a proper justification, for denying that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.090" offset="517972">The Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, Mr. Justice Powell has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Mr. Justice Rehnquist joins and Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision in case.</text>
