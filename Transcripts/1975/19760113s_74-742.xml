            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5.112" offset="94063">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.718" offset="116528">Section 16 B of the Security Exchange Act of 1934 allows a corporation to recover profit, realized by an officer, director, beneficial owner of more than 10% of its shares, where that has been a purchase and the sale of its shares within a six months period.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.292" offset="214853">We took this case to determine the meaning of an exemptive provision, which specifies that the statute does not cover any transaction where the beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and the sale of the shares involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.262" offset="294683">As the facts of this case are too complex for oral summary, I will announce only our decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.874" offset="329165">We conclude in view of the language of the exemptive provision, that a beneficial owner is accountable for profits in a purchase sale sequence, only if he was such an owner, before the purchase as well as, at the time of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.191" offset="406383">As the respondent in this case was not a beneficial owner before the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.213" offset="430520">The subsequent sale within six months, is not subject to section 16B.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.730" offset="460508">The Court of Appeals was of the same view.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.265" offset="474719">Accordingly we affirm this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.093" offset="486004">Mr. justice White joins in all but part 4 c of a court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.474" offset="515574">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
