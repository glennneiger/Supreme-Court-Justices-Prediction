            <text syncTime="45.095" offset="283712">I am here on behalf of the Attorney General in the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in the case of Baxter v. Palmigiano.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.442" offset="317045">This case centers on two issues, whether counsels are required to be present at in prison disciplinary hearings where the infraction complained off may also be the subject of criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.751" offset="374305">And second, whether use immunity must be granted for any statements made at the hearing where the silence of the inmate is considered as a factor by the disciplinary board.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.764" offset="426341">Before I address of those two issues, Your Honors, I would like to make mention of a footnote in the Solicitor General’s brief, questioning whether a three-judge court should have been convened in this case and I must state that the Solicitor General was in error when he says that, this case is an attack on the Morris rules because there is nothing any rule or statute or regulation of the State of Rhode Island which prevents counsels from being present at these disciplinary hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.147" offset="555908">The rules are clear that an inmate has a right to assistance by a classification officer or any other individual authorized by the warden and since the decision of the First Circuit, attorneys have been authorized by the warden to be present in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.167" offset="631977">So therefore, no holding in this case withhold the statute of Rhode Island or regulation to be invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.659" offset="909920">And therefore contrary to the government’s suggestion a three-judge court was not required and that it was properly heard and determined by a single district judge, therefore, the appeal is proper to the Court of Appeals and certiorari of the jurisdiction exists in this Court, is that your point?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_a_dwight" startTime="218.289" stopTime="219.873">
            <label>Mr. Ronald A. Dwight</label>

            <text syncTime="219.873" offset="982854">But as I understand your reasoning behind that, you are saying that the reason it is not an attack on the Morris rule is that out of force of compulsion you have complied with the First Circuit's judgment and that does not seem to me to be a very satisfactory reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.983" offset="1055265">There maybe other good reasons why a three-judge District Court was not required, but to say that Rhode Island is now doing something that the First Circuit told it that it had to do that it would not other wise do, I do not know that is an entirely adequate answer of the government’s point?</text>

            <text syncTime="256.000" offset="1127363">Well, Your Honor we are just -- we made a legal determination before the First Circuit's decision that legal counsel were not required, but in no way has there been any change in any statute or regulation of the State of Rhode Island, that is my point.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald A. Dwight</label>
            <text syncTime="284.167" offset="1240003">Well, my point is that the Morris rules do not forbid counsel at disciplinary hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.028" offset="1267379">They state that it is any person authorized by the warden or the Department Of Corrections and actually when the Morris rules were drafted, I have been told that this specific point was not covered because of the doubt on it, and therefore, they decided to leave it blank.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.824" offset="1326625">And to, I will put this language and it will authorize either lawyers and non-lawyers depending on what the law determined to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.818" offset="1366540">To go on to the facts of the case, inmate Palmigiano who was incarcerated in the Rhode Island Adult Correction Institution for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.850" offset="1414710">On November 11th 1972, decided that another inmate needed medical attention and because it was not being granted quickly enough, he went around advising the other inmates not to return to their cells at the time of the 9 p.m. lock up.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.817" offset="1486599">He was subsequently charged within Correction's office with inciting a riot and a disruption and he was told that evening that he might be prosecuted for state crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.517" offset="1533410">Two days later, a disciplinary hearing was held pursuant to the Morris rules and at that time after consulting with his attorney prior to the hearing, he asked that he be admitted to the hearing of the Captain Baxter who was the Chairman of the Disciplinary Board, stated that disciplinary boards, our disciplinary boards, they are not courts of law, it will be treated as a disciplinary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.652" offset="1629959">You have been offered to postpone it, you refused it.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.233" offset="1640199">We do not have as an institutional policy attorney sitting in on disciplinary hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.836" offset="1658694">Your request is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.094" offset="1671650">A case was brought in the District Court and the District Court of Rhode Island concluded that procedural due process had been awarded to the inmate, Mr. Palmigiano appealed to the First Circuit where the First Circuit held in Baxter one that he was committed to have a retained counsel, but not appointed counsel and that use immunity should be granted for any statements that he made.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.061" offset="1783559">The State of Rhode Island petitioned for its certiorari which is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.169" offset="1799964">The case was vacated and remanded in light of this Court‘s opinion in Wolff v. McDonnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.778" offset="1822429">The First Circuit handed down a second opinion in which they stated that no counsel was required except in those cases where an infraction might be the subject of criminal prosecution and in that instance they said that Miranda perhaps required the counsel be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.420" offset="1892960">And then they also stated the use immunity would be required where the silence of the inmate at the hearing was considered as a factor against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.908" offset="1922948">It is states position here that this Court's opinion Wolff v. McDonnell has already covered the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.295" offset="1956490">If underlying facts in Wolff v. McDonnell include inmates who had committed infractions are also possible subject of criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.800" offset="2002465">The Wolff v. McDonnell case was a class action unlike this case and there were inmates in that case who had -- where they committed infractions for insurrection, threatening to kill an officer, assault and drunkenness.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.914" offset="2099014">It is the state's position that because of these underlying facts, Wolff v. McDonnell covers the situations of disciplinary hearings where infractions may also be a subject of possible future criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.369" offset="2160767">More specifically, there is a footnote in the Court's opinion in Wolff v. McDonnell which specifically cites Baxter one.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.983" offset="2207265">And in the body of the opinion the Court said that it is our view, however, that the procedures we have now required in prison disciplinary proceedings represent a reasonable accommodation between the interest of the inmates and the need of Institution, footnote 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.754" offset="2270377">And that footnote reads that the Court of Appeals which have ruled on procedures required in prisonary-disciplinary proceedings have been split.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.345" offset="2300679">As to counsels, two circuits have held there is no right and then several cases are cited and then it states the First Circuit, Baxter v. Palmigiano, holds there is a right to retain counsel even where a staff assistant is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.845" offset="2354700">Well, the Ninth Circuit, Clutchette v. Procunier envisions some sanctions in disciplinary proceedings calling for provision of counsel and has determined that counsel must be provided where a prison rule violation maybe punishable by a state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.878" offset="2410811">It is our position that this footnote clearly indicates that this Court did not agree with that conclusion and that it is determination in Wolff was supposed to be a reason more accommodation of this type of case as well as the case where the infractions is not the subject to future criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.500" offset="2493358">If one looks at Miranda, which is really the issue here, how far does Miranda apply, once these that the underlined situation there that cause the Court to issue its opinion was the incommunicado interrogation of possible suspects.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.190" offset="2612059">We pointed that out and I think that the Court stated many times in Wolff v. McDonnell that disciplinary hearings are not criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.945" offset="2643092">But our point is at the Sixth Amendment is not applied here at all and there is any requirement of counsel, it is because the Fifth Amendment does apply certainly and that the Fourteenth Amendment may require counsel if the Court should determine that it is necessary to protect the Fifth Amendment rights of the inmates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.072" offset="4623592">This Court has limited Simmons in many ways in recent years and it is the state's position that this situation is much more akin to that in Gardner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.059" offset="4663507">In Simmons there were two constitutional rights involved, the Fourth and the Fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.510" offset="4681374">Here there is only one constitutional right involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.096" offset="4691719">Whether the inmate is going speak, the Fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.881" offset="4710841">That is much more akin to the situation in the Gardner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.380" offset="4724842">The inmate faces a problem that very, a person that is committed a crime faces whether he will claim the Fifth or not and there is compulsion in the sense that it may be in his favor to talk to the disciplinary board, but that is no different than the compulsion in every criminal case and this is not even a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.048" offset="4811464">So it is the state's position that use immunity is not constitutionally required in this situation and in fact there are impediments under Rhode Island Law to use immunity being granted because generally it can only be done when attorney general applies to the presiding justice of the Superior Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1588.781" offset="6458432">I think it is very important in a prison that disciplinary hearing follow very quickly in the infraction and that is what happened in Palmigiano situation and the state feels that it could do this or rapidly if counsel were not required at the hearings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1630.334" offset="6624676">My answer to that is no, not when he is charged with a serious in-prison infarction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.296" offset="6668457">I contend that the reading of the Morris rules in the appendix will indicate there is a distinction between minor infractions and major infractions, not for the minor infraction, I excuse me for the major infraction as we had here he could not have absented himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.763" offset="6878377">I would like to submit to the Court that we seek no extension of Wolff v. McDonnell in disciplinary hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.275" offset="6912441">We are not contending that sufficient time has a elapsed from Wolff v. McDonnell so that this Court may now reconsider whether such circumstances have changed, so that additional safeguard should be afforded at the in-prison process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.693" offset="6982135">In seeking the ingress of counsel into these proceedings, we are not asking that counsel be permitted to cross examine, to challenge the composition of the board, to assist the inmate in the presentation of his case as such, but solely to be there if there is to be interrogation and if in fact a criminal prosecution is threatened.</text>
