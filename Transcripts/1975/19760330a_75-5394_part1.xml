            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104890">We will hear arguments next in 75-5394, Jurek against Texas and 75-5844, Roberts against Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.711" offset="335708">Mr. Amsterdam you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_g_amsterdam" startTime="60.858" stopTime="158.360">
            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="60.858" offset="348247">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.405" offset="374474">As I know the Court has already been informed, during the first hour I shall be presenting the argument for the petitioners in both, Jurek v. Texas and Roberts v. Louisiana and the respondents in both of this two cases will then reply seriatim during the next hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.490" offset="458797">Since these are the first of five cases in which the Court will be considering the constitutionally under the Eighth Amendment of varying in forms of capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.547" offset="523058">It may be useful of the outset to give the Court a brief description of the present state of capital statutes in the country, statutes now in effect and of the representative character of five that are in now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.011" offset="600903">Decision of these cases may go in broader and narrower grounds and I think it is useful for the Court to know how these cases fit against the total picture of capital legislation in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.647" offset="651476">Since the Court's 1972 decision in Furman, capital punishment statutes have been enacted in 35 states of which 34 are now in affect because the Illinois Supreme Court has struck down the constitutionally of that state death penalty statute on the variety of state and federal grounds.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="158.360" stopTime="162.696">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="158.360" offset="738307">Did the Massachusetts Court not also strike down its statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_g_amsterdam" startTime="162.696" stopTime="721.192">
            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="162.696" offset="755652">Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, but was pre-Furman statute and I will come to those in just one moment, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.293" offset="786059">I am talking only about statutes enacted since Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.623" offset="799329">The federal government of course has also punished with death, certain killings in course Air Piracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.931" offset="824511">Now, these various statutes range in breadth in terms of the crime which is made capital, from the federal statute on the one hand which is narrow one and the statute in Rhode Island which punishes murder by a prison inmate, to broad statutes which make all first degree murders punishable by death and sometimes other crimes as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.078" offset="913119">The pre-Furman statutes which this Court mentioned in Furman and whose constitutionally were reserved or I should say largely out of the picture now because they had either been superseded by new legislation as in Ohio, Rhode Island, Virginia, or in Massachusetts where they were not, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has invalidated as cruel and unusual punishment the pre-Furman rape-murder statute in that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.288" offset="1029938">So, we are basically talking to that, about the 34 post-Furman statutes or 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.323" offset="1062121">Now, these assume a variety of forms, but I think they can fairly be characterize into four major categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.411" offset="1102454">First of all there are the statutes which involve a bi-fabricated trial, a two-stage trial proceeding, during the first of which, the jury determines whether the defendant is guilty of a crime to find this cap and during the second stage of which the jury considers or the judge considers and this may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, there has been advisory jury, a list of aggravating circumstances and a list of the mitigating circumstances or there may just be aggravating circumstances as in judge with no listed mitigating circumstances, but the unique characteristic of this group of states is a weighing process in which aggravating and mitigating circumstances are supposed to be balanced in some way to determine their sufficiency for the purpose of the imposing the penalty of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.960" offset="1304642">Now, there are eight states which has have that kind of statute of which statutes of Florida and Georgia, now before the Court are quite represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.164" offset="1341527">The second of the four categories are statutes which require a finding of some specified fact, where circumstance or condition, in addition to the elements of the crime described as a capital crime, which has to be found, which must be found in order to support the imposition of the capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.284" offset="1429925">Now, these statutes sometimes have a two-stage proceeding bifurcated trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.824" offset="1456152">Sometimes they have a one-stag proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.674" offset="1467541">Sometimes as in Wyoming they have both, that is depending on the crime, but the important characteristic here is that there is no weighing or balancing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.741" offset="1511845">Inquiry is made whether a particular circumstance and aggravating feature exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.703" offset="1527623">If it does then the death penalty is be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.850" offset="1540266">Sometimes there is a provision that if the aggravating circumstance is found, but a mitigating circumstance is also found, that the death penalty shall not be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.865" offset="1576315">This is the federal statute for example, the Air Piracy Statute and Texas is very good example of this kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.614" offset="1603274">In Texas, as we will see shortly when we get to the Texas Statue, it is not enough to convict the defendant of capital murder in order to sentence him to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.370" offset="1634307">In addition to that, three special verdict questions are submitted to the jury and life or death depends on the answers to those three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.519" offset="1670879">Now, the Texas Statute is the representative statute and that group is before the Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.578" offset="1691150">It looks a little different on its face than many of the other statute in this category because it has this rather unique feature about the determining whether there a probability that the defendant would engage in a continuing course of criminal violence and would be a danger to the society, but it is interesting that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has read into it, some of the ALI aggravating and mitigating circumstances by saying that you answer that question by saying whether the defendant acted under duress, whether the defendant had emotional troubles and that sort of things, so Texas is a fairly representative statute of this second group.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.769" offset="1839943">Now, that has nine states in it plus the Federal Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.393" offset="1854363">Alright, now third group of capital statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.548" offset="1871081">The third group of statutes where, again, capital punishment turns on finding some particular designated fact or condition, but here the fact or condition is built into the definition of the capital crime as element of the crime and here we always have a single verdict trial by the definition and what we are talking about is states in which something narrower than first-degree murder is punishable by death, it maybe called capital murder, and maybe first-degree murder in five situations, but the Jury has to find at the single verdict trial whether the case falls within those situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.297" offset="2022069">Here there are 11 states and the Louisiana Statute is perfectly exemplary of those states.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.825" offset="2048087">The final class is the simplest to describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.003" offset="2060834">It is simply statutes making all first-degree murder capital, using the fairly common and traditional outlines of first-degree murder that is premeditated and deliberated murder, felony murder, the usual what has always been of some local variation.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.642" offset="2127394">First-degree murder in this country and there are seven states in that category and, of course, North Carolina is representative of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.994" offset="2152786">My bottom-line is obviously that this Court is seeing in the five statutes here before the Court, although all of these statutes are vary bit by bit, a very representative set of the capital punishment statutes which are now in effect in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.741" offset="2215793">Now, I want to make one minor point and three major ones about that general description.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.913" offset="2240452">My minor point is that these statutes which were summarized in the appendices to the briefs, have to be looked at with some caution in mind because they generally do not fully reflect the local law governing the application of death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.343" offset="2294160">For example, the Georgia Statute says in terms that after a conviction of capital offense, the Court shall resume the trial and hold the penalty trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.124" offset="2341285">But in fact we know and briefs demonstrate that, a solicitor at that point can simply waive the death penalty and there will be no penalty trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.601" offset="2375244">The brief of Colorado Public Defender System's amicus curiae in this case points out that the similar Colorado practice is simply to stipulate not to have a penalty trial that practice is used in Texas as well so that there are variety of outlets that do not appear on the face of the statute when the Court examines the description of statute it would be aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.281" offset="2461971">Secondly, there are, of course, general principles of criminal procedure that make these statutes look differently than they look on their phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.376" offset="2498333">A good example is California where in theory, again, after the defendant is convicted of a capital of crime, the Court if the so-called special circumstances, aggravating circumstances are alleged in the indictment, shall convene a penalty jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.352" offset="2554235">However, there is a general principle of California Criminal Procedure under 1181 sub-division 7 of the Penal Code, that a Trial Judge has complete discretion to strike from a in indictment allegations of factual matters which enhance penalty, so that the aggravating circumstances can be struck out at the discretion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.579" offset="2651202">I simply am going to give a sense that the statute should not taken as they are written.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.444" offset="2670637">There are couple rather obvious propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.224" offset="2677742">One, the statutes are tidier in print than they are in operation and number two, they are a lot tidier at this point in time than they will be if they go on for any period of the time because of the natural tendency of any system to develop shortcuts and outlets and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.491" offset="2738764">Now, the three major points that need to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.849" offset="2748273">First, the use of the death penalty at this point in time is therefore characterized in this country by elaborate winnowing processes, involving a selective screening of cases potentially subject to the death penalty and an array of outlets for avoiding the actual use of the death penalty, either by the second stage penalty proceedings in which aggravating and mitigating circumstances are either balanced or adjudicated or else by definitions of the capital crime which narrow the capital crime and set it off from others along often intangible and impressionistic lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.211" offset="2937713">The contrast I think is striking between capital punishment as it is authorized by these statutes and the next more severe penalty known to our law, life imprisonment, where if you look you will find statute --</text>

            <text syncTime="765.382" offset="3166337">No, I do not think that it was necessarily, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.247" offset="3181801">That is the way the states chose to use capital punishment, the decision to have a very narrow class of cases to draw the lines to have aggravating and mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.394" offset="3230389">I think the very variety of responses indicate that the states could have responded by making all crimes, including jaywalking punishable mandatorily by death, that would have been response to Furman as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.609" offset="3275319">The particular form which the response took was not dictated by Furman, although of course, the response was a response to Furman.</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="877.499" offset="3614807">The suggestion was certainly made that the legislatures might respond this way and what I am describing simply is I think something that one might not have predicted which is the perpetuation of a whole array of mechanisms for selectivity after Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.714" offset="3707698">You might have expected simply that the states would come back and enact mandatory death statutes, for the most part they have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.983" offset="3732776">For the most part, they have come back with these highly elaborate and articulated winnowing devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.908" offset="3752420">Now, I am not suggesting for the moment Mr. Justice Blackmun, I think the mandatory statute is mandatory in any sense and that is the point I am going to come back to the moment, but in specific answer to the question, I do think the form that the statutes have assumed is indicative of something less than a broad based acceptance of the death penalty in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.744" offset="3839773">It is a regular part of the penal armamentarium of American Society, Life imprisonment, yes, broadly accepted, generally accepted, no particular care to winnow it down, but when the death penalty is involved, all of these selective procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.279" offset="3913961">Now my second major point is that in addition to these winnowing devices, there are other procedures in every state in here I come back the mandatory death penalty statutes, so called mandatory death penalty statutes, which permit additional outlets through which potentially capital cases can be processed to non-capital conclusions and the dearth penalty can averted from some defendants, while being applied to other defendants in distinguishable cases on unaccountable grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.145" offset="4057426">Some of these procedures are unique to capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.521" offset="4070905">For example, the statutes may provide that in order to charge capital crime, there must be special allegations in the indictment which the prosecutor can simply choose not include.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.154" offset="4105491">Some of these procedures are not unique to capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.050" offset="4117089">There are common to non-capital and capital cases, but they assume particular importance in capital cases such a commutation, for example, where the action has always been on the death case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.014" offset="4152929">The attention or focus of concern, the intensity of using that sort of thing or the procedures very commonly found in jurisdictions where otherwise lesser offenses are not submitted generally, that in capital trial the judge will always, as matter of routine, give the jury the lesser options, so that it can let the defendant off the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.891" offset="4244358">Some of these outlets and procedures are common in all cases, but assume a particular character in significance in capital cases for a variety of reasons I am going to come back to, but the most important of which is that the life death decision is inevitably enormous out of all proportions to the factual differences in the particular cases in which the choice of life or death is made and the nature of the decision by judge or jury to kill a human being, involves an intense, unique, condemnatory judgment that has to be made in often sensational atmosphere of the capital trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.361" offset="4426274">Now, the third point and this will lead me into the constitutional issues specifically about the general array of statutes, Is that I think the difference is among the states are less impressive than the similarities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.993" offset="4476848">Although these states differ in technical detail, the government’s brief I think is right in it is amicus presentation in talking collectively about all of them and describing all of the administration of criminal justice in this country as providing, if you will, the road to death with avenues that discretionary mercy shooting of from the beginning of the process to the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.754" offset="4571829">The avenues are different in different jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.936" offset="4580606">They work differently as technical matter, but basically the sameness, the remarkable sameness of this process appears in all of the five records and all of five statutes that this Court has and in the other statutes as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.071" offset="4633164">Now, that brings me to the two constitutional submissions which are made by the petitioners Jerry Lane Jurek and Stanislaus Roberts in these two cases and by the petitioners and the companion cases and they are first, that death sentences imposed pursuant to systems of arbitrary selectivity of this sort are unconstitutional under Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.378" offset="4734310">The square a holding in the Furman decision rightly concedes, compels that result and secondly that apart from this specific holding in Furman, the death penalty as it is used or as it is proposed to be use today is an excessively cruel punishment when it is assessed against the history of this country's use of the punishment in this century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.411" offset="4818529">Now, these are separate contentions, although they are closely connected and in part three of our brief in Jurek we describe the interrelationship as best we can between the two arguments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1457.450" offset="5934689">Let me describe the Texas Statute for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.591" offset="5955169">By the way, just one word before I do and this is in the nature kind of an index through the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.661" offset="5979515">I just want to point out that the primary briefing of this argument is in part two of the Fowler (ph) brief that we did not re-repeat these arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.109" offset="6021311">I know it is difficult to read and apologize for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.361" offset="6030297">We thought it would be more difficult, if the Court had to read the same darn thing, six different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.361" offset="6050255">The major argument about discretion and why we think that the system is brought within the holding of Furman is made in part two of the Fowler (ph) brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.468" offset="6094663">There is in appendix to the Jurek brief at the pages 2-27 and 2-42, a further development of that argument in terms of the theoretical basis that we thought we did not have to establish again after Furman, but since the Government has made a somewhat veiled challenge to Furman itself, we thought it was worth repeating in laying before the Court again the theoretical principle that perhaps the most important function of the Eighth Amendment serves in a democratic society is to protect against penalties which are cast in such a form that through discretion in their use they can be applied selectively and sporadically to a numerical fuel, so that the ordinary pressure is on legislation to keep criminal penalties descent or diffused and that is found as I said in the Jurek appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.740" offset="6307822">Now, the Fowler (ph) brief is written in terms of premeditated and deliberated murder, however, I just want to call the Court’s attention to the fact in Woodson and Waxton (ph) brief, in North Carolina brief, we draw the parallel between felony murder and other kind of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.319" offset="6370098">We thought it was most useful to draw that parallel there because the Court could thus compare North Carolina Law as to both felony murder and premeditated and deliberated murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.212" offset="6401654">And finally, part two the Jurek brief and part of the Roberts brief discuss the specific procedures in Texas and Louisiana that we challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.061" offset="6437076">Now, Mr. Justice White with my apologies for having going amiss let me come back and answer Your Honor's the question, if I may, which is the critical question I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.570" offset="6479081">Let me describe that Texas statute involved in Jurek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.389" offset="6502382">The Texas statute is a bifurcated trial statute, in which capital trial is divided into two stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.777" offset="6535923">The first, to the determine guilt and to determine specifically whether the defendant comes within one of the five categories of murder which are defined as capital murder which make his crime punishment by the death or life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.774" offset="6603946">If he is found to fall within one of those five categories and there is a second stage, at which the life or death choice is made, by the submission of specific questions to the jury to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.488" offset="6654833">Let me start by describing the second stage, the so-called sentencing proceeding not because this is the only stage at which arbitrary selectively enters into the choice of those who have not died, but because an examination of that stage will point up how little change has in fact been made from the statutes as they existed in Texas and elsewhere prior to Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.347" offset="6754203">The first thing, I want to note is that at the outset of a Texas Capital Trial, the jury is death qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.693" offset="6779594">It is required to be death qualified by statute and it is required to be told prior to trial that the question of life or death is an issue and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has held that Furman governs that death qualification for reason I think is quite important realistically in assessing the Texas Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.687" offset="6855558">And I refer to Howella (ph) case which is cited on Page 48 in a footnote of our brief in which the Texas Court held Furman applicable because it said, “The fact remains that the jury will know that their answers to the specific questions, submitted at the penalty phase, will determine whether the defendant is to be punished by death or life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.989" offset="6940821">To say that the jury’s answers would not affected by their attitude toward the death penalty as a punishment for crime simply because they will not bring forth ultimate verdict, simply because the law attaches death to the answer to factual questions, would be to disregard the obvious.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.072" offset="7457106">Now, the first question, warning question three whether the conduct of defendant causing death was the committed deliberately and with reasonable expectation that death would result and whether there was provocation, are questions which the jury has already answered before finding the defendant guilty of capital murder because the definition of the category requires a resolution of both of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.813" offset="7560132">The respondent does not dispute this, but simply says in it is brief that it would not be a logical to rephrase substantially the same question in other way before imposing the death penalty given the infinite variety of human conduct and the imprecision of the English language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.825" offset="7620110">The plain fact remains, however, that the jury is being asked to use the same criteria, both to put people into the class of capital murderers and then to the distinguish among those in the class with the result that this a clear invitation to the jury to deal inconsistently with the facts in it is supposedly factual answers to supposedly factual questions if it wishes to spare the defendant’s life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.433" offset="7726585">The second statutory to a question is whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.</text>

            <text syncTime="1943.732" offset="7879767">I think it is important to hammer home how this record shows this provision is going to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.157" offset="7909442">In this case, the evidence on which the jury solemnly decide that the defendant, that there was probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society, that evidence consisted of one; the fact that defendant have committed a capital murder which of course is true in all cases and two; the one line hearsay opinions of four local citizens in the community that the defendant’s reputation for peace and good order was bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.555" offset="8043084">Now, this case was tried under this statute exactly the way it would have been tried before Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.870" offset="8064296">The state’s position was simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.358" offset="8070252">The defendant is reprobate, the defendant killed daughter of local peace officer, the defendant ought to die.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.137" offset="8093344">Those prepositions have nothing to do with the issues submitted under Texas Statute which theoretically guide the jury sentencing decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.461" offset="8122706">In fact, however they determine life or death and the ironic thing, the thing that is most devastating I think, is that you cannot even challenge the jury’s finding because the question to which it responds are so meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.992" offset="8188848">You can say on this record that the jury in this case found without sufficient evidence, that the defendant was guilty of capital murder on the theory of attempted forcible rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.705" offset="8231688">I mean, that is a question that has meaning and the answer to it is that the evidence here is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.709" offset="8263662">That is the kind of question you can challenge and answer, but how can you, even on the absurd basis on which this jury condemned this defendant to die for hearsay statements that the defendant’s reputation is bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.319" offset="8310160">How can I say that the evidence is or is not sufficient to establish that there is a probability that the defendant may engage in the future criminal conduct that may be a danger to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.929" offset="8360524">The question is to void of intangible meaning and the answer is unchallengeable and Mr. Justice White that is one of the reasons why the statute is exactly where we were in Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.406" offset="8406500">The issue of life or death is simply commit to a unfettered power of the jury without accountability or review, the determination being made in the answer to supposedly factual questions which are simply predictive judgments as disguised for determination of life or death, no less free, no less in unfettered, no less arbitrary than prior to Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.439" offset="8518617">Now, this explicit sentencing discretion is itself both precedent and followed under Texas procedure by a series of other equally arbitrary decision making processes that decide the question of life or death.</text>

            <text syncTime="2192.714" offset="8875659">I think that we do not have to rely on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.286" offset="8886003">I think the jury discretion alone make this statutes bad under Furman, not withstanding McGautha and the reason for that is that what McGautha was concerned with was the validity of specific procedures used by the state and our whole point is that Eighth Amendment question is not a Due Process question of the validly of this procedure or that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.990" offset="8972834">It asked about total impact, the result of the state procedure on federally protected interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.265" offset="9001883">Now Furman, some has said is inconsistent with McGautha, some have said that the jury discretion which was recognized in Furman as invalidating the death penalty under Eighth Amendment was no more or less than the jury discretion that the McGautha and how it is consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.877" offset="9064368">If you take that you and I do not, then our position is inconsistent with McGautha, but my I am answer to your question specifically Justice Stevens is, we would rely on jury discretion alone without anything else if they were nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.751" offset="9119852">We think that the is squarely controlled by Furman and we think that the Furman is not in consistent with McGautha because Furman is an Eighth Amendment decision which looks to the consequences of jury discretion rather than simply whether the procedure is good or bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.401" offset="9182441">I would like to talk to the broader question of the impact not only of jury discretion, but all of these processes in tandem, not so much in connection with Jurek, but rather Roberts because it will be easier to put them all together there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.149" offset="9245448">So if I may, let me just describe now, the parallel process in Louisiana and then see if I can draw it all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.367" offset="9282333">Louisiana Procedures for the handling of capital cases have much in common with those in Texas and other states, but they also have certain localized features that deserve some mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.519" offset="9330921">Louisiana has unitary trial procedure, a one state, not a bifurcated procedure and the decision whether the defendant shall suffer death is made at this single stage trial by a verdict determining whether or not this case falls within one of five categories, designated as first-degree murder in the Louisiana Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.508" offset="9430918">Prior to Furman, Louisiana did not divide murder into degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.506" offset="9446905">It provided that all murders were punishable by life imprisonment or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.604" offset="9467280">Then as now, murder cases were tried under a single stage procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.553" offset="9495074">Then as now, they were governed by the characteristic Louisiana procedure of what they called responsive verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.346" offset="9534258">In Louisiana, there is statute there is a statute provides which verdict should be submitted to the jury upon any charge of a given offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.180" offset="9581592">Now, prior to Furman, the responsive verdicts that had to be submitted to Louisiana jury on a murder charge were, guilty which carry the death sentence, guilty without capital punishment which is of course a verdict of death penalty, guilty of manslaughter and not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.164" offset="9657452">When it became apparent that this scheme has been invalidated by Furman because it offered the choice to the jury of guilty verdicts with and without capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.639" offset="9699352">The legislature enacted a new law in 1973 which now provides is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.803" offset="9724012">Murder is subdivided into first and second-degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.024" offset="9736968">The responsive verdict statute has correspondingly been amendment and now on a trial for capital first-degree murder, there are still four responsive verdicts; Guilty of first-degree murder which entails the death penalty; guilty of second-degree murder which of course averts the death penalty; guilty of manslaughter and not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.289" offset="9813977">Like the four responsive verdicts submitted to the jury prior to Furman, these four responsive verdicts must be submitted to the jury in every capital case without regard to the evidence and whether or not there is a slightest evidentiary basis for finding the defendant guilty of anything less than first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.796" offset="9892031">The jury is death qualified in advance so that they know the their choice of verdicts determines life or death and the bottom-line in short is that jury is permitted to return a non-capital, second-degree murder verdict in every first-degree murder prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.507" offset="9962875">This is called the Louisiana Law and always has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.592" offset="9975205">If the Court would look at page 62 and 63 of brief in Roberts, Louisiana Supreme Court puts it this way under our peculiar jurisprudence when trials for murder, the jury may find the prisoner guilty of manslaughter, although the evidence may show him to be guilty of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.838" offset="10044168">Next page; the Peterson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.968" offset="10052737">In Louisiana where there is evidence to prove the greater offense, it is the jury’s province to determine the existent of well known of lesser culpability and exercise the statuary right to return a manslaughter verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.029" offset="10108952">This Court will now look to the evidence to make such a determination, that is now to a second-degree for which Louisiana Legislature has now upped the minimum penalty to 40 years to life, so that what is has done in this pass of legislation is in fact give the jury a non-capital option exactly like they had before, except the names of the verdicts have been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.207" offset="10209680">Now, it may be useful here to compare the practice in Louisiana with that in other states because this Louisiana practice is also quite common, although it is not called responsive verdicts and there is no statuary basis for it elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.170" offset="10281569">Some states like Florida for example which is before this Court in one of the five cases always submit lesser degrees of homicide to the jury regardless of the evidence, just like in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.142" offset="10325455">The state's brief in Florida seems to suggest that that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.659" offset="10343427">That the submission of less sentence depends on the evidence, but the states pretty simply fail to draw out the distinction that Florida Law draws which is distinction between lesser degrees of an offense and lesser totally different offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.438" offset="10390552">In Florida lesser degrees of an offense are always submitted without regard to the evidence so --</text>

            <text syncTime="2657.835" offset="10736204">I think that one might do it on the ground that the amount of arbitrariness which is exhibited in practice might be thought to be diminished by the smaller range over which you have to apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.992" offset="10796808">However, Mr. Justice Stevens, I would argue the other way which is that the smaller the range, the more arbitrary the distinction because the cases by definition are all the same to start with, that is they are so close together at the beginning that discretion within those cases is more arbitrary and that is why, Your Honor, I find it difficult to answer conclusively to the question, I do not think it makes a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.112" offset="10881236">In my argument, if I were arguing that kind of the case, I would say even the narrowest beats a definition of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.242" offset="10921778">If it allowed total and absolute discretion to sentence the life or death within it or glossed over that discretion, papered it over with these kinds of procedures would be bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.358" offset="10962320">But I could see, Your Honor, a possibility that one might disagree with that, but still not these statutes then because they are broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.431" offset="10994608">Now, as far as I say in a number of other states, always submit as in Louisiana, lesser degrees without regard to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.850" offset="11032224">In some states, like Georgia and North Carolina and Texas which are now before the Court, lessers are theoretically supposed to be submitted only where there is evidence to support them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.324" offset="11082170">However, in fact a couple of practices should be noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.355" offset="11098261">First of all, appellate decisions admonish trial judges to submit, to err on the side of submitting lessers in any case where the question is doubtful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.787" offset="11139953">Secondly, convictions of unsupported lessers that is if judge in the case where the evidence shows only first-degree murder, submits second-degree murder and manslaughter and the jury convicts of second-degree or manslaughter, the Appellate Court, virtually everywhere affirms on the ground, well the Texas statutes says expressly that a verdict is not contrary to law in evidence, where it convicts a defendant of an inferior grade of the offense that is proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.407" offset="11242457">North Carolina reaches the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.965" offset="11252697">Florida reaches the same result on the theory that defendant can look at a gift horse in the mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.928" offset="11268580">Now, but I think the important point here, we are talking about defendants who are sentence to less than death looking gift horses in the mouth, once is a gift to them is by ineluctable logic as Professor Charles Black says, very much less than a gift to the defendant who is does not get grace and is not spared and is not in the exercise of an equally unaccountable discretion, save from going to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.518" offset="11374950">In other point, that in a total look at the way capital punishment functions under the various statute so to be made, is that where lessers are not submitted, lesser degrees of murder as in some felony murder case where the evidence may make out felony murder or not, it is almost invariably so, at least for the prosecutor exercising his discretion, chargers the felony in the same trial that the felony is submitted separately from the murder and the jury has a choice convicting of the felony and letting the defendant off of the capital count.</text>

            <text syncTime="3028.162" offset="12217452">What we have is a system in which often amorphously defined undistinguished capital crimes of considerable breath, narrower questions make come up later, but now a considerable breath, are submitted to a legal process in which the decision to move the defendant forward toward death or let him escape, avoid death is made in series of stages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3425.713" offset="13807682">There is nothing that we argue in this case that will touch imprisonment, life imprisonment any of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.182" offset="13837566">Now, why do we say death is different?</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.465" offset="13846657">One, because this Court in Furman said it was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.605" offset="13859300">It seems to me that there is no doubt that this Court did not mean to strike down in Furman sentences of life imprisonment 20 years, 10 years although judges had just this broad discretion to sentence to those things or less as they did to life or death under the systems invalidated in Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.454" offset="13926696">Secondly, the legislatures of the states have recognized that death is different and this is the thrust of my point, that in responding to Furman, 35 legislatures have come back with this narrow, technical approach, allowing avoidance, very careful winnowing procedures that allow wholesale outlet, whereas, 52 jurisdictions and 400 made life imprisonment sentence to just you know use the penalty, death is different, the legislature says it is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.650" offset="14047486">Our legal system has always treated death differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.766" offset="14059920">We allow more preemptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.438" offset="14066608">We allow automatic appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3494.196" offset="14081654">We have indictment requirements, the anonymous verdict requirements in some jurisdiction because death is different and finally death is factually different.</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.419" offset="14126480">Death is irremediable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3509.354" offset="14142258">It goes beyond this world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.846" offset="14148214">It is legislative decision to do something and we know what we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.425" offset="14170575">Death is different because even if exactly the same discretionary procedures are used to decide issues of five years versus ten years or life versus death, the result will be more arbitrary on the life or death choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.560" offset="14235045">Now, why do I say the result will be more arbitrary in life or death choice?</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.026" offset="14252913">It will be more arbitrary on the life or death choice because the magnitude of what it is stake in choosing to kill somebody or spare them, it works the factual differences on which the decision is to be made, renders them as Professor Kelvin in (Inaudible) said, the meaningly trivial compared to the states in a way that no such other decision is unrelated to the factual basis on which it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.613" offset="14367329">The decision is different, the discretion is different and the result is different Mr. Justice Stewart in a death case than is a case where lesser penalties are an issue because as the history of capital punishment under the discretionary system struck down in Furman shows, the death penalty has become so repugnant to those who must actually apply it in the particular cases as distinguished in the abstract question how to get on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.912" offset="14468475">That in order for a jury and judge and a prosecutor and governor to condemn a defendant, an intense at Furman in condemnatory judgment has to be made which is very different from the kind of judgment applied when it is a five or ten-year question which is a judgment, which is uniquely difficult to control, uniquely difficult to rationalize or regularize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.988" offset="14556769">Now, that combines with the breath of discretion which is in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.246" offset="14577772">Some of which is like the discretion involved elsewhere and some of which is not, create a total pattern whose result is that the infliction of death on specific defendant condemned to die is cruel and unusual.</text>

            <text syncTime="3646.619" offset="14691352">To Mr. Amsterdam’s first point that the system of selectivity such as was condemned in Furman still exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.694" offset="14747568">We would say certainly has applied to the Texas Statutes and I hope that I will able to demonstrate this before I am done, that is not a correct statement and that the system of selectively condemned in Furman does not presently exist in the Texas Statute either in theory or the best evidence of actual practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.159" offset="14857491">Now, as to his statement that the prosecutorial discretion, jury discretion, discretion on behalf of Chief Executives of our State, that type discretion, no statute obviously can cure that nor should it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3716.736" offset="14971803">It would be an anomaly to say the least, if where to condemn today in this country as unconstitutional, the very procedures that our constitution created, the same constitution that created the cruel and unusual punishment provision relied upon by petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.240" offset="15073785">It would be an anomaly to say that we cannot constitutionally carry out a sentence today of death in this country solely because it is being carried under the very constitutional procedures that created this country and upon which is founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.956" offset="15148704">Indeed, that argument proves too much and I am sure it will be summarily rejected by every justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.443" offset="15182559">Now as to preposition that the execution of the death penalty in this country, regardless of circumstances, regardless of the crimes that are selected out by the states by which it has to have application, the wisdom of state legislature, regardless of the procedures that are used, regardless of how careful one may be, regardless of the time span in selecting a fair and impartial jury, regardless of the impartially of the prosecution, regardless of the facts, regardless of the circumstances of the crime, regardless of affording all the due process for which this country is noted, regardless of all that, Mr. Amsterdam would tell us that execution of the death penalty in America is cruel and unusual punishment, even in those events it must be condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.184" offset="15417556">Need one today, say more to this Court than that statements stand without any legal precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.016" offset="15448903">He stands utterly alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="4143.912" offset="16680524">Under our definition of murder, our definition of murder is a person commits an offense, if he intentionally or knowingly causes the death of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.439" offset="16726604">Now, we had a case brought under the statute it happened in Beaumont where an individual was trying to break into the jail and release some prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.408" offset="16778431">He went in heavily armed and he went in shooting, but in the process actually the policeman that was killed by a guard that was trying to resist the entrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.296" offset="16837990">So in that particular case, the jury convicted of capital murder, but found no to this first question of his, of a deliberate conduct causing the death.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.018" offset="16884906">His conduct was deliberate in the sense that he was in and been all mischief and shooting, but it was not and it may have been a knowing thing on his part, but there is a distinction between the deliberate conduct it asked about in the first question and some types of capital murder not in all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.596" offset="16975186">It is a last sovereign look by the jury where can in fact be a distinction in circumstances of the case and we have 15 if the Court please, no answers to these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.496" offset="17030774">They have not been just idle academic gestures.</text>

            <text syncTime="4248.026" offset="17096916">The last case in which that was answered no; there was young 21-year-old black that killed a white policeman in the City of the Austin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.894" offset="17144459">There was some evidence presented, not sufficient to convince the jury that there was a provocation, but there was some evidence of a degree hassling and the individual had no prior record of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.272" offset="17213945">He was 21 years of age and that question was answered no and his life was spared.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.081" offset="17245187">And so I submit Mr. Justice Stevens that the question served the valid purpose of trying first to tie down that this is a deliberate, cold-blooded, voluntary type of killing without any degree, if there was any provocation at all, it cannot be utilized and to try to separate out those individuals who from the type of crime that they have committed, have shown themselves to be likely recede of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4808.294" offset="19338013">And the question of recidivism, it seems to me is same as question on deterrent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.603" offset="19363300">Mr. Amsterdam himself, it seems to me acknowledged the significance of deterrent when he said that if given a choice these defendant would choose the life sentence, when he was debating about whether or not they should have a choice during the sentencing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.102" offset="19437279">And of course, that just is simple recognition by him of his intuitive extinct of human nature to seek, to sustain our own life, the life that we all know is important to every individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.634" offset="19495375">That is an extinct of every human being and if that be so, then why is not it and why should not it be allowable as the deterrent, as social goal of deterrent to prevent a lifer in a prison from taking life with immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.089" offset="19569145">Why should it not be a deterrent to prevent someone who had small child that he intends to rape or kidnap, to have not the incentive of his own life to return that child?</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.531" offset="19626928">Why should not we permit a law in our states such as in Texas, 70% of our crimes under this statute has with been murder with armed robbery, 70% of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.000" offset="19680844">And incidentally they broken, I want to talk a little bit more about that from ratio of standpoint to show that our statute once it begins to operate, it operates free of the any racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.560" offset="19727029">Why should not there be a deterrent for a person who goes to inconvenience store and undertakes to take someone's life not to have the deterrent of his own life, when he is snuffing out the only eye witness to that crime in most instances?</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.083" offset="19797141">So, I do not want to debate all of the reports that are here before you, and about deterrence and there values, but I think Mr. Amsterdam admitted the thing that it appeals to our own logic and common sense when he said that the criminal himself will always seek life rather than the extreme penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.624" offset="19867359">Of course, it is excessive in its severity, but not in a constitutional sense and that is where we differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.774" offset="19895884">I will take the backseat to no one in revering human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.865" offset="19912289">We are talking here about a constitutional question and our very constitution created the right, I submit, on the part of our state legislators to make this discriminating choice, painful as at it is, difficult as at it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.349" offset="19986268">We tried to meet the objections and criticisms that this Court lay down as best that we could discern them and we turn to a statute where we selected out, murder first, murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4982.935" offset="20036528">Now under our prior Texas Statute that you condemn, we could put people to death for rape alone, for rape alone, we could put them to death.</text>

            <text syncTime="5051.569" offset="20311127">The worst one known as far as calculation and design, murder for hire, when you go pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.142" offset="20337458">Certainly, if there is any state saying as a crime that we ought to be able to deter in exact not an excessive punishment, but at least a proportionate one for that type of activity and we said armed robbery and I have already demonstrated what a problem that has been in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.528" offset="20410914">The taking of life; it is bad enough to commit the crime of armed robbery, but the consistent taking of life that is gone with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.411" offset="20434529">Do you mean our people have no right in our state to try deal with that question and with feeling that there is some deterrent to this excessive, but constitutional penalty?</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.663" offset="20479460">I mentioned the present situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.916" offset="20488550">Well, we already had it in our state and fortunately, now if this Court will say so, you take our statute out from under a cloud and say to the next person who is a lifer in a penitentiary in the State of Texas that if you kidnap women who are in there teaching and you kill them, the state has right to ask you to pay in a proportionate way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.250" offset="20589801">Those are the kinds of crimes that we dealt with under our statute, crimes arising out of robbery, burglary, rape, arson and kidnapping and then we said to our police officers that we believe we have a right to set a standard to say if someone kills a police officer in our state that they know is in course of his job that it is not an excessive and severe punishment to ask for his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.918" offset="20700560">Now, in that particular category of cases under our statute, we have had three whites kill policeman, two of them received death, one have received life.</text>

            <text syncTime="5334.965" offset="21444737">The case of Robert versus Louisiana pertains to a young black man who killed a 61-year-old white man, while engaged in the armed robbery of a filling station on August 18, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.331" offset="21514118">The statute which existed in Louisiana prior to the Furman decision was the Murder Statute which provided that if you had a specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm on anyone and he died as result of that then you could receive the death penalty or would receive the death penalty, if you were found guilty as charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.274" offset="21609935">However, in the list of responsive verdicts to the prior murder charge in Louisiana prior to Furman, one of the responsive verdicts was that the jury could return a verdict of guilty without capital punishment, if the jury saw fit to give mercy to the person who was being tried and who was found guilty then they could return a responsive verdict of guilty without capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.380" offset="21734382">However, after the Furman decision was the decided by this Honorable Court, the Governor of the State Louisiana appointed the commission and they met and they enacted certain laws in special session in Louisiana which takes a two-thirds vote to open such special session to legislation such is this which would could be considered normal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.735" offset="21835737">The commission discussed the Furman decision and the Statutes of Louisiana as they were at that time and we came up with the first-degree murder statute and a second-degree murder statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.255" offset="21901879">The first-degree murder statute which Louisiana now has encompasses those types of killings where the defendant himself initiated the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5460.194" offset="21945661">In another words, he started or put into motion whatever later caused the death.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.396" offset="21974395">In other words, he took a gun and he went into as service station and he held that service station up and as result of his being there with this dangerous weapon and as a result of his specific intent to kill, someone died.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.496" offset="22042836">These types of crimes where placed into the first-degree murder statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.353" offset="22066242">You take the crimes of murder where you have the family argument, you have the bar room brawl where there is specific intent to kill, but it is not initiated by you committing a felony or you killing a policeman while he in the engagement of his duties or while you are in the prison or while you are committing aggravated rapes or other more serious felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.744" offset="22199780">First-degree murder encompasses those particular items.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.416" offset="22218483">Second-degree murder takes care of those items or those murders which were not initiated by the defendant himself while he in the perpetration of those particular instances.</text>

            <text syncTime="5606.289" offset="22529968">They must find specific intent to kill.</text>

            <text syncTime="5641.643" offset="22671447">Now, if the state fails to prove each and every one of those elements then he of course is instructed to return a verdict of not guilty or he is given a list of responsive verdicts which he can return.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.693" offset="22743649">Now, this was discussed at the commission when the new laws were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.418" offset="22770503">It was at first thought that it would be best just to have guilty or not guilty, but suppose that the state proven a man -- was unable to prove a man guilty of first-degree murder, but he is able or does prove him beyond a reasonable doubt guilty of second-degree murder, should he go free?</text>
            <text syncTime="5694.359" offset="22882307">The state has proven that he committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.563" offset="22899130">They have not proven that he committed a crime of first-degree murder, but they have proven beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of another crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.530" offset="22946986">Therefore, the Jury can bring in a responsive verdict of the particular crime that has proven to it beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5719.699" offset="22983662">Now, when the judge instructs that jury and he must instruct them each time, if you find that the state has proven beyond a reasonable, all the elements of first-degree murder, it is your duty to return a verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.939" offset="23048550">Then the Court instructs as they did in this case, if you do not find that the state has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt as to first-degree murder, but that you do find that the state has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt as to second-degree murder then it is your duty return a verdict of second-degree and own down to responsive list of verdicts until it comes, if the state has not proven any elements of any these crimes then you shall return a verdict of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5770.876" offset="23188358">Then if this jury returns a verdict of guilty as charged, the first-degree murder, it has no discretion whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.191" offset="23229631">The Judge has no discretion whatsoever is then a mandatory death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.059" offset="23257112">There is no discretion by a person as to whether a particular person will die or not die.</text>
