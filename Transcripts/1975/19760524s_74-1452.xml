            <text syncTime="11.062" offset="117893">This is case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.345" offset="142971">The petitioner hospital brought a Sherman Act action alleging that the respondents had conspired to block the expansion and relocation of the petitioner's hospital for purposes of monopolizing the business of providing hospital services in Raleigh North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.760" offset="212665">In order to establish the requisite nexus within the state commerce the petitioner alleged that a substantial portion of its medicine and supplies came from out of state, a large portion of its revenues came from out of state insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.663" offset="272329">The brand expansion will largely financed through out of state lenders and that all these interstate involvements were being adversely affected by the respondent's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.545" offset="315797">Nevertheless, the District Court dismissed the action on the pleadings on the ground that the provision of hospital services is essentially a local business and respondent's conduct only indirectly and insubstantially affected interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.324" offset="382984">The Court of Appeals affirmed in an opinion filed with the clerk we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.412" offset="403255">While there may have been no allegations that respondent intended to affect interstate commerce and no allegations that the alleged conduct affected market price or forced petitioners out of state suppliers to go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.522" offset="459679">Our decisions indicate that the requisite nexus with interstate commerce under the Sherman Act is established as long as the conduct in question as a substantial effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.344" offset="510984">The complaint in this case fairly read, adequately alleges such an effect, and therefore the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</text>
