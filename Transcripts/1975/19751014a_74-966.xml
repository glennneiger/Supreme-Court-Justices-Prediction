            <text syncTime="14.676" offset="161993">Mr. Tetreault, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis L. Tetreault</label>
            <text syncTime="17.586" offset="173696">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.399" offset="188951">This case involves the imposition against the shipowner of penalties in excess of $35,000.00 and this amount fine due is in addition to an award in favor of a seaman or the seaman’s estate of the sum of $510.00 plus interest, which amount had been brought by the shipowner found by the District Court in the first instance to have been an amount which was in fact paid to the seaman as part of the shipowners’ obligation to pay his wages in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.322" offset="344641">Throughout the handling of the case in the District Court and the Court of Appeals, and I think there is no question of the law on the subject as the shipowner, the money was paid in Vietnam under circumstances where U.S. dollar currency by the local law was not permitted to go into circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.326" offset="436592">I assume the reason was simply that there was a great disparity between the black market rate and the official rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.726" offset="470238">The seaman was discharged for a cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.499" offset="481314">There is simply is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.449" offset="489150">That has been conceded throughout the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.031" offset="499495">It would also has been held even by the Court of Appeals, whose opinion imposed this penalty that the cost of repatriation following a discharge for cause was as between the shipowner and the seaman, the obligation of the seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.160" offset="575981">We thus have a situation which quite literally is one in which a penalty of $35,000.00 has been imposed, and if we apply the maximum of the law that will assume to have been done which should have been done, where if everything had been followed literally, even in accordant with the plaintiff’s desire and wish, the $510 representing the cost of buying air transportation back to this country would immediately on the seaman’s return to this country and the payment of the remainder of his wages have been returned by the seaman to the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.837" offset="766675">So one has, may I say either absurd or outrageous depending upon the point of view, a situation in which we have a penalty in excess of $35,000.00 imposed for the theoretical deprivation, taking the plaintiffs’ case at its best.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.047" offset="1359550">I believe in good conscience and the best of my study can come forward with, that the explanation lies in a misreading of this Courts’ opinion and Isbrandtsen versus Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.658" offset="1421931">And I assume that the Court has some familiarity with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.525" offset="1437395">That is a case in which the shipowner offset or attempted to offset, against the seaman’s’ wages, the cost of deviating the ship to provide medical treatment to a seaman who had been, without justification stabbed by the seaman plaintiff who was suing for his wages and penalty wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.811" offset="1526525">The holding in Johnson versus Isbrandtsen in its express terms and I quote is that the, well, there are few three dots, if you will, before that that the shipowner so far and here is the quote, “deductions for derelictions in the performance of duty” is limited to the specific fines and penalties that are provided in Section 701 or a few other miscellaneous provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.110" offset="1663720">The heart and the basis of the misunderstanding I think by the Court of Appeals in this case and some of the trouble in the other Circuits relates to the extrapolation of the carrying beyond the holding of this Court which related to penalties into the subject which we have here, where there is in fact an attempt with, again, some of the seaman with all sorts of official watch dogging, if you will, of a payment in kind of an attempt to actually make the full payment to the seaman.</text>

I think there is a very, very serious question and here we have, I do not intend this as a digression, but this brings, I think into play, the entire subject of this group of statutes, and how they are being handled and what is to be done in fairness on both sides.</text>

            <text syncTime="569.310" offset="2380520">It has been held by this Court, so far as I am aware consistently in the opinions to this Court since Pacific Mail Steamship versus Schmidt, that without sufficient cause language embodies, should be read as including within the statute a rule of reasons so that if the shipowner is acting reasonably at any stage of the process in which payment is not made, the penalty is not triggered and this is true, even though there may be a legal, a technical-legal failure on the shipowners’ part in having either made payment in the wrong manner and the wrong medium, or having made an improper deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.043" offset="2595456">Here in the Schmidt case, it was held by this Court, that the shipowner had a valid, let us say by valid, I mean a colorable, an arguable, a good faith argument from appealing from the District Court opinion and during the course of the appeal, this Court reversed the Court of Appeals’ decision, which had imposed the penalty during the course of appeal, saying in effect that the shipowner was entitled to pursue his rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1498.351" offset="6096700">This proceeding this morning challenges two of the most important and basic rights belonging to the American seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.117" offset="6127838">The first one became a seaman’s right at the same time that all American citizens acquired that the constitutional right to due process before being deprived of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.696" offset="6174127">The second right is a very important one that makes enforcement of the first possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.390" offset="6336922">However, on the repatriation point, I am going to deal with that first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.840" offset="6366701">At the trial, I summarize by saying there has been error carried consistently through this litigation with respect to the repatriation aspect, the contract implied on the part of the seaman to repay the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.405" offset="6428977">At the trial, the court spoke to the seaman’s counsel and said the proposed findings of the defendant indicate that the shipowner had no obligation to bear the expense of the plaintiffs’ return to the United States.</text>
