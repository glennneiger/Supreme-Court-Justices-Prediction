            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103386">We will hear arguments first this morning, a number 74-1452, Hospital Building Company against the Trustees of Rex Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.021" offset="151451">Mr. Train, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="16.315" offset="168588">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.317" offset="180604">The question of law presented here in this case is whether a conspiracy between two business competitors to take over and dominate a market to the exclusion of the third competitor is actionable under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.796" offset="230550">Specifically, whether the traditional interstate commerce test for Sherman Act jurisdiction are met by the allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.869" offset="262837">The business in question is the delivery of hospital services.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.598" offset="277675">The geographical market in question is Wake County, Raleigh, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.053" offset="299513">Petitioner Hospital Building Co. or HBC owns and operates Mary Elizabeth Hospital in Raleigh.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.599" offset="329711">The named conspirators are essentially the two competing hospitals in Raleigh, Rex Hospital and Wake Hospital, and various persons associated with or acting for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.472" offset="377254">The conspiracy alleged is that these two competitors and the other conspirators which have been referred to in our brief as the Raleigh Group have conspired to allocate the market for hospital services in terms of customers and of output in Raleigh to fix prices for hospital services and to foreclose effective competition by HBC in that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.479" offset="473280">This, we submit to the Court is no second rate conspiracy as the Fourth Circuit majority opinion appeared to assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.175" offset="504000">In order to accomplish the purposes of the conspiracy, the Raleigh Group has undertaken among other actions to prevent expansion through relocation and construction of an entirely new facility by HBC from an old 49 bed hospital to a new 149 bed hospital, a tripling of capacity and ability to compete.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.797" offset="642553">We have before us only the allegations of the complaint and the size of the market is not in the record, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.463" offset="677139">The basic issue before this Court--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="145.924" offset="687066">You say, tripling the number of beds. If it had 2, it would want 6, that is still triple, would that be tripling?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_k_train_iii" startTime="152.753" stopTime="240.719">
            <label>Mr. John K. Train III</label>
            <text syncTime="152.753" offset="714338">That, I understand that Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.347" offset="724682">The basic issue before this Court is whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to meet either or both of the two test for jurisdiction under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.268" offset="764388">The in-commerce test and the affecting commerce test.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.965" offset="783197">The competition restrained by the conspiracy is real.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.516" offset="797407">Hospitals, whether government owned, nonprofit or proprietary profit making such as HBC, compete to serve patients who pay for treatment there or for whom payment is made by third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.624" offset="849861">This is what the complaint refers to as paid hospital business.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.564" offset="865639">Such competition is of the price and price equivalent variety such as lower rates and charges, the inclusion of additional services in basic rates and also of the non --priced variety.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.957" offset="911197">More modern and pleasant facilities, larger stance, more extensive and modern equipment, just as in other businesses, hospitals compete by offering better services and facilities, lower prices or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.059" offset="967621">The provision of hospital services, the business of operating a hospital, involves much more than placing a bed in a building and hiring a staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.881" offset="1006909">The hospital business is not just a local business.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.999" offset="1023314">Hospital services cannot be provided by HBC or by any hospital without a continuing and substantial flow of drugs, equipment and supplies.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.894" offset="1094890">Your client is a profit hospital, for profit hospital?</text>

            <text syncTime="271.262" offset="1188408">Your Honor, again I emphasize, we are dealing solely with the complaint since the case was dismissed on a motion under 12 (b) (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="279.808" offset="1222576">There is nothing in the record to indicate that, I am sure it has stay of rules and regulations like so many of them do.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="286.286" offset="1248490">Well, you were speaking of the three hospitals competing and then usually a profit hospital is restricted in its admission policies to patients of those physicians who own it.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_k_train_iii" startTime="299.613" stopTime="300.240">

            <label>Mr. John K. Train III</label>
            <text syncTime="302.661" offset="1314005">Your Honor, physicians do not own this hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.676" offset="1326021">This is owned by a profit making corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.375" offset="1340859">I do not believe that the patients who are subject to admission to a profit making hospital are necessarily restricted to those of the physicians who own it.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.444" offset="1385162">I believe and again I am talking outside the record because we do not have a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.502" offset="1401358">But I believe their limitation is that they must be admitted by members of a staff there and I believe that typically the staff is wider than just those paid physicians who might own it.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.553" offset="1449528">In any event, as I say, this hospital is not owned by physicians and there is no evidence of any restrictions on admissions to this particular hospital or for that matter, the other two hospitals insofar as this record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.271" offset="1508460">Hospitals, of course, as we have stated that do not exist in vacuum, they have to purchase goods and supplies just like any other business.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.958" offset="1547122">It is alleged in the complaint that a substantial amount of HBC's purchases of these supplies are purchased from out-of-state vendors.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.209" offset="1584215">And further, that 80% of the supplies of HBC are purchased pursuant to nationwide supply contracts which are negotiated by HBC's out-of-state parent corporation, Charter Medical in Macon, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.795" offset="1638550">A hospital, likewise, cannot function without management and administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.360" offset="1656731">HBC purchases and receives management services from its out-of-state parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.222" offset="1680242">Hospital services cannot be furnished unless they are paid for and today, that means receipts of payments from third party payors, both private insurance carriers and governmental programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.992" offset="1727262">Almost 95% of HBC's billings are to third party payors and the source of such payments in a substantial number of cases is located outside the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.177" offset="1776059">In short, interstate commerce is at the heart of the operation of any hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.046" offset="1795494">And in particular, is at the heart of the operation of Mary Elizabeth by HBC.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.045" offset="1815556">Drugs, supplies, equipment and other goods are purchased in the interstate commerce as ingredients of the ultimate product, hospital services, which is purchased by patients, the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.153" offset="1867905">In turn, bills are rendered to and payments received from out-of-state financial sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.928" offset="1890997">HBC as the operator of the hospital and the furnisher of hospital services is at the center of, and is an integral and essential connector between these flows of goods and payments in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.939" offset="1947108">In these circumstances, we submit that any conspiracy to restrain competition by HBC in a limited market where there are only three competitors, HBC being one.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.235" offset="1992248">In the furnishing of hospital services is actionable in Federal Courts under both the effects commerce test and the in commerce test for jurisdiction under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.842" offset="2034671">We will discuss first, the effects commerce test.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.462" offset="2053166">We respectfully submit that a conclusion adverse to that of the Fourth Circuit is compelled by this Court's consistent application of the effects commerce test to find jurisdiction under the Sherman Act with respect to so called local conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.612" offset="2113770">In such cases as Southeastern Underwriters, Women's Sports Wear and most recently Goldfarb, this Court has made clear that the designation of a particular business as local or intrastate does not answer the question of whether or not that business or conspiracy to restrain it is subject to the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.583" offset="2193704">Southeastern Underwriters in particular teaches us that the distinction between what has been called local and what intrastate is a type of mechanical criterion which this Court has not deemed controlling in the measurement of Federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.741" offset="2266325">Not withstanding this admonition, the Fourth Circuit majority like the District Court in the St. Bernard Parish case cited in our brief which was reversed by the Fifth Circuit dealing with the same issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.445" offset="2313136">The Fourth Circuit was mesmerized by its focus on the supposedly local nature of the hospital business.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.808" offset="2338527">As already noted, this characterization is a misconception.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.079" offset="2355664">The essence of the hospital business is the interstate flow to, through and from it, of goods, bills and payments.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.970" offset="2435180">The reference is to the few contacts with interstate commerce as consisting of payments made from the Oregon Medical Society Association arrangement of the insurance for hospital payments from Oregon to other States where patients covered by the Oregon arrangements had gone to other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.070" offset="2531624">The Supreme Court characterized those I believe as fortuitous and sporadic, I believe was another word that the Supreme Court there used.</text>

            <text syncTime="621.597" offset="2589721">Well, I believe, I can state my place that I think they have, I do not believe that case is authority in support of the Fourth Circuits opinion here since as I say in that case, the Supreme Court in commenting on the interstate commerce involvement made it clear that it was not substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.906" offset="2687001">There was not a substantial effect on interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.002" offset="2699330">Here, and as opposed to sporadic and infrequent payments across state lines, we allege a continuing flow of such payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.715" offset="2738201">I am referring if Your Honor please, to the Supreme Court opinion in that case and not to the District Court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.933" offset="2771115">The question is not of characterization of something as local or intrastate, the question is whether interstate commerce is affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.489" offset="2813329">As Mr. Justice Jackson said in Women's Sports Wear, it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter how locally operation which applies the squeeze.</text>

            <text syncTime="711.884" offset="2950837">Because our position is not, Your Honor that every conspiracy or every effect on interstate commerce is actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.643" offset="2981871">I think the cases have made it clear that the effect must be what the case is being substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.562" offset="3005590">This Court has measured that quantitatively, it has measured it qualitatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.879" offset="3026802">In the Oregon Medical Society case, I think we have a case where according to the opinion written by Mr. Justice Jackson, there were just no substantial effects on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.306" offset="3080509">The Fourth Circuit's majority opinion, may it please the Court, states the effect on commerce test, and the words that have been used before by this Court and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.636" offset="3121887">But then it reads it out of existence as we see it by engrafting upon it three additional conditions not previously deemed to be a part of that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.249" offset="3160339">First, according to the Fourth Circuit majority opinion, the aim or object of the conspiracy whether it is "directed at" a supposedly local activity is an element in determining the substantiality of the effect on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.023" offset="3227422">Jurisdiction under the Sherman Act is not, we submit, a function of intent, but rather a function of impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.360" offset="3256784">Intent maybe relevant in a limited sense to show the probable effect of an Act, but where the effect is clear, intent, we submit, is not relevant to determine the substantiality of that effect under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.715" offset="3318224">In addition, we respectfully submit to this Court that the allegations of the complaint described a conspiracy directed not just at HBC, not just at an expansion of the hospital but at an entire market.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.258" offset="3376320">The goal of the conspirators being to control and allocate all of the paid hospital business in the Raleigh area.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.342" offset="3404741">This does not just keep HBC from competing, we respectfully submit, it keeps everyone from competing.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.332" offset="3432640">It denies entry to all potential interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.705" offset="3446119">Second, the Fourth Circuit's majority opinion, finds the complaint defective for purposes of jurisdiction under the Sherman Act, because there is no showing that out of State suppliers or payors will go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.344" offset="3504738">We submit that the question is whether there is an effect on the flow of commerce, not whether there is an effect on out of State links or originatives of that flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.576" offset="3545593">In Goldfarb for example, this Court rejected the argument that there was no showing that purchasers were discouraged and no showing that somehow the out of State lenders were affected anti-competitively by the conspiracy there found to be actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.276" offset="3604421">Finally, in seeking to verbalize a formula for application of the Sherman Act, the Fourth Circuit majority, engrafted a monopoly power requirement on the essential jurisdictional allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.174" offset="3656039">Section 1 of the Sherman Act of course, is designed to reach restraint prior to the development of monopoly power.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.410" offset="3684983">This Court has never required the existence of any competitive power sufficient to drive a competitor out of business before finding the Sherman Act applicable or rather Section 1 of the Sherman Act applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.071" offset="3731585">Section 2 of course, deals with monopolies.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.982" offset="3743288">Again may it please the Court, even accepting the Fourth Circuit vision of the true test here.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.134" offset="3767843">The power alleged on the part of the conspirators here, the power to allocate the market among themselves, the power to fix prices, and crucially the power to exclude HBC from the market, represents precisely the danger Congress sought to guard against in its enactment of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.365" offset="3848823">Substantiality is a requirement which this Court has found to be satisfied both quantitatively and qualitatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.836" offset="3886648">It is certainly satisfied quantitatively if a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce is affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.988" offset="3919249">The quantitative standard, may it please the Court, is satisfied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.064" offset="3939624">The conspiracy here has operated to restrain a tripling in size of a business through its relocation and reconstruction in a new facility, and perhaps Mr. Justice Blackmun, this gets to your question as to the size of the quantity of what is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.234" offset="4012245">In 1972, this business purchased approximately $112,000.00 in supplies and equipment on a regular and continuing, not a time basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.337" offset="4052682">And a substantial amount of that was purchased from out of State sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.710" offset="4070132">Such purchases, it is alleged in the complaint, would increase substantially after expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.216" offset="4096150">HBC purchased $36,000.00 worth of management services from its out of State parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.183" offset="4124049">That payment is based on a gross revenues formula and likewise these purchases of management services would increase substantially upon expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.419" offset="4161038">A substantial flow of capital, at least 4 million dollars, communications and services in interstate commerce will result from the relocation and the reconstruction in a new facility of Mary Elizabeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.906" offset="4214955">Finally, revenues are received in substantial amounts by HBC from out of State payment sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.272" offset="4240450">More patients would be served by relocated and expanded hospital and thus, more revenues received from out of State payment sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.974" offset="4275246">The quantitative effects on Interstate commerce here are both present and potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.018" offset="4299383">But equally as real in each case, present effects lie in the immediate prevention of an expansion of the flow of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.994" offset="4331357">The goods and the services which would have been purchased by an expanded and relocated HBC, the capital and additional revenues which would have flowed to HBC from out of State; the potential effect is the terminal choking off of all activity of the conspiracy's ultimate goal, the exclusion of HBC from the market is achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.868" offset="4422785">Perhaps one of the problems, we have had in articulating the effect on commerce of the conspiracy is due to the fact that the conspiracy has blocked an attempt to expand, relocate and thus, trouble the capacity of HBC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.185" offset="4484121">We are therefore forced to talk about what might have been and we hope what will be in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.663" offset="4510034">In these circumstances, the fact that this action unquestionably falls within the line for Sherman Act jurisdiction that has been drawn by this Court as best demonstrated perhaps by turning the situation around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.981" offset="4559249">If this case alleged the existence of a 149 bed hospital and had the defendants combined and conspired to eliminate that hospital as a competitor for hospital services in the Raleigh area, and to reduce by two thirds, its ability to do business, and if the reduction in HBC's business resulted then in a significant decrease, a measurable decrease, in the flow of goods, supplies, credit, reimbursements and so on from out of State to HBC, then I think the Lower Courts would have had less difficulty in seeing that this substantially effects commerce test for application of the Sherman Act had been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.214" offset="4724238">We submit that it is clear that there is no functional or legal difference for purposes of application of the Sherman Act between a conspiracy which prevents expansion and entry of a business competitor and one which results in contraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.547" offset="4789544">Therefore, the effect on interstate commerce being both obvious and we believe substantial, the conspiracy causing these effects is actionable under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.869" offset="4846805">The quantity or extent of the flow of interstate commerce is not alone determinative as to whether there has been a substantial effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.645" offset="4881913">This Court has observed just last term in the Goldfarb case that where there is an effect on interstate commerce, no specific magnitude of the effect need be proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.059" offset="4923605">As we have discussed, the impact here is sufficiently certain of measurement as to satisfy the quantitative requirements of the effects commerce test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.806" offset="4962579">In addition, the activities here in question without regard to the specific magnitude of interstate commerce affected by them have effects which the Congress surely must have intended to prevent by enactment of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.532" offset="5021512">The allegations of that complaint present a picture of perhaps the classic restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.621" offset="5041783">Two competitors undertake to control and divide a market to the exclusion of the third.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.103" offset="5063726">The third infused with management and capital by an out of State source undertakes to become an effective competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.968" offset="5099252">By the actions taken pursuant to a non competitive arrangement, this initiative is thwarted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.926" offset="5123076">In this case we submit, what we have is not only the stifling of existing competition, the stifling of an existing competitor, but what we have is the denial of effective entry to a new entrant into the market through the erection of artificial barriers around that market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.010" offset="5195383">In such a case, purchasers and consumers in that market are denied and deprived of the advantages of free competition and the Sherman Act maybe invoked against the conspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.916" offset="5255046">We believe the jurisdiction is also present here under the in- commerce test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.615" offset="5273750">HBC operates in the flow of interstate commerce and any competitive restraints on its activities thus impact directly on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.209" offset="5312202">In the American Building Maintenance Industries decision in 1975, this Court has stated that to be in-commerce, a corporation must itself be directly engaged in the production, distribution or acquisition of goods or services in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.111" offset="5379807">HBC as a purchaser of a substantial amount of goods and services in interstate commerce; management services essential to the functioning of HBC and of its provision of hospital services come from outside the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.624" offset="5441874">The goods and management services purchased by HBC for its operations which are essential part of those operations are purchased on a continuing and regularly recurring basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.457" offset="5489208">In all cases, these goods, these services, purchased in interstate commerce originating outside the State of North Carolina are essential ingredients of the product; medical, surgical hospital services which has been purchased by the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.874" offset="5558798">We have touched previously upon the interstate system of payments, what we refer to as the nationwide payment system which today exist for the purchase of health care in general and hospital services in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.227" offset="5616268">In determining whether HBC as an interstate commerce, it is particularly appropriate to consider this developing nationwide system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.550" offset="5653570">The existence, we respectfully submit, of a nationwide payment system establishes that those participating in it are in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.041" offset="5695471">Finally, the series of Federal Statutes which by their own terms or through decisions of this Court have specific application to hospitals, demonstrates the strong federal interest in the furnishing of hospital services in this country today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.162" offset="5764016">We do not argue that jurisdiction under the Sherman Act is conclusively presumed if the activities in question are regulated under Federal Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.942" offset="5799125">We do say however, that to the extent that the activities in question are the subject of other federal regulation, their supposedly local character is diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.213" offset="5848235">The pervasive regulation of health care services in this country today demonstrates the major federal concern in this area and offers a strong indication that delivery of health care services is not solely a matter of local concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.546" offset="5909570">Certainly, the pervasive federal regulation of delivery of hospital services is inconsistent with the finding below that as a matter of law the provision of hospital services are a purely local activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.060" offset="7419553">I submit that in the Sherman Act jurisdictional issue, we should again look at the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.285" offset="7448496">My client is Rex Hospital, a non --profit public hospital in Raleigh North Carolina as alleged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.532" offset="7481410">The product market here is the provision of hospital services in Raleigh and that is also the geographic market, Raleigh North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.770" offset="7522370">The provision of hospital services as I think almost everyone knows is essentially such things as the provision of a hospital room, the provision of nurses' services, the provision of an operating room, a place where the doctor can come and serve the patient, provision of meals to you while you are in the hospital, provisions of linens on your bed, all these various factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.285" offset="7628428">And it is true that at one time or other, the bed that you are lying as a patient for a week in the hospital may have come from interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.658" offset="7673985">The surgical equipment used by the doctor when he operates upon you may at one time have been purchased in interstate commerce or from a local wholesaler who purchased it in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.575" offset="7721633">And that the medicines and drugs administered to you in the hospital, may at one time have come from a manufacturer or a shipper in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.345" offset="7752666">But we submit in virtually every walk of life, this is the case indeed, I would submit that in virtually every interstate transaction, it is eventually consummated in a local purchase or a local delivery of a service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.941" offset="7827063">That does not mean that since you are the ultimate recipient on that chain, you become a part of interstate commerce for Sherman Act regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.700" offset="7914103">Does it not necessarily imply that the hospital is engaged in interstate commerce when the purchases drugs at a lower price than perhaps a wholesaler pays?</text>

            <text syncTime="1999.048" offset="8099572">Can hospitals ever come in under Sherman Act and we do not argue that, we take the same position as was Stated in the Goldfarb case and was Stated in the Yellow Cab case that there maybe occasions when legal services or Taxicab services that local activities could be of such a nature that they could restrain trade under the Sherman Act and I would submit that in Congress in running a Robinson Patman Act and putting that Statement in was not saying that hospitals are always into the Sherman Act, you have to look at the individual restraint, which is what we are doing here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.433" offset="8353064">I think there was only several thousand dollars involved but it was a piece of machinery coming from out of State to be installed in a local restaurant but the restraint was on the price of that piece of machinery.</text>
