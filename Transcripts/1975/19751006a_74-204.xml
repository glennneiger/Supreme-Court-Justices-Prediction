            <text syncTime="69.921" offset="384482">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.812" offset="396080">We are here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the issue we brought up is the question of whether Social Security Disability Benefits can be terminated in a procedure which allows for the submission of evidence by the claimant, written evidence, but does not include an oral hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.770" offset="479881">The Court below held an oral hearing was required by the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause under an extension of the rational of Goldberg against Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.449" offset="514571">Here, the Secretary of HEW terminated respondent’s disability payments in 1972 on the basis of medical reports and respondent was given a summary of that evidence, given an opportunity to submit additional evidence and a written rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.770" offset="579878">There were post-termination procedures available to him, including a full oral evidentiary hearing which I will describe in a moment, but he brought this suit instead of availing himself of those procedures, claiming a constitutional right to a pre-termination oral hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.454" offset="642676">I have two propositions to advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.950" offset="652603">The first is a late blooming jurisdictional issue and to be candid about it, the reason it is late blooming is because our initial analysis of the application of Weinberger against Salfi decided last June to this case resulted in the conclusion which we now think erroneous, but the District Court had jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.776" offset="739956">We proceeded for some time on that belief and it was not until work on other cases required re-thinking of the problem that we reversed ourselves and came to a contrary conclusion that Salfi’s rational precludes the District Court’s assertion of jurisdiction in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.491" offset="838803">Well, the basis for the original conclusion was not my own conclusion Mr. Justice Stewart, but I believe it was that the constitutional issue might be final here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="234.654" offset="1043394">That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart to file a brief in response.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.172" offset="1065546">I have really very little to add to the jurisdictional argument made in that supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.020" offset="1088847">So I would to like to maybe outline it and spend most of my time if I may on the due process question where I believe there may be something to add to the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.416" offset="1122493">The jurisdictional problem is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.764" offset="1135868">The relevant statute is Section 205 of the Social Security Act codified as 42 U.S.C. 405 and 205 (h) which was involved in Salfi as it is here states that no findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or governmental agency except as herein provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.840" offset="1280168">Now, in Salfi, this Court concluded that 205(h) precludes the assertion of District Court jurisdiction except insofar as jurisdiction is then provided in Section 205 (g) and if we turn to 205 (g), we see that it confers jurisdiction upon District Courts to review any final decision of the secretary made after a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.778" offset="1383927">Those provisions were not dispositive in Salfi, but they seem to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.776" offset="1399914">In Salfi, the only issue was a constitutional issue whether a categorization made by a statute was a constitutional categorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.701" offset="1439620">So that it would have been as the court said futile and wasteful to require the claimant to exhaust the administrative process and it also decided, the Court also said that the secretary had decided that the reconsideration decision involved in Salfi was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.171" offset="1505448">Now, neither of these grounds is present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.033" offset="1516942">Here the secretary did not base his decision on a statutory probation or statutory categorization of eligibility which is subject to the constitutional attack, but upon a factual the termination that this respondent was in medical effect no longer disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.638" offset="1595414">And it would not have been futile and wasteful to ask this respondent to exhaust its administrative remedies which is I say would have included an oral hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.260" offset="1633866">Moreover, the secretary has not here determined that the order terminating disability benefits was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.078" offset="1657167">He was entitled to administrative reconsideration, to an evidentiary hearing and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.903" offset="1676394">He availed himself of none of this, but brought suit before the secretary had made a final decision after a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.281" offset="1709935">Since 205 (g) does not confer jurisdiction under these circumstances, 205 (h) bars the assertion of jurisdiction by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.555" offset="1750999">I think there is no mere technicality.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.951" offset="1760612">It is important to judicial administration of course that administration remedies be exhausted, even when not required by statute, and here at Congress has specifically mandated the exhaustion of administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.343" offset="1810140">I should like now to turn to the merits of respondent’s constitutional claim about due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.380" offset="1838353">The issue is whether he is entitled as a matter of due process to a full oral evidentiary hearing before any benefits paid to him under the disability insurance program may be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.499" offset="1886836">The considerations to be weighed in making that decision of course are well known.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.575" offset="1899166">They were outlined in Cafeteria Workers against McElroy and stated the number of later cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.629" offset="1923303">What constitutes constitutional due process in a given context depends upon intensely practical considerations peculiar to that case and that process and the balancing of the governmental interests and the private interests that are affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.781" offset="1987982">We are in effect dealing with a cost benefit judgment and so view the question becomes really how many -- the decision of this case will have a heavy impact upon the decision of how many decisional processes of government must be conform to a judicial model rather than to an administrative model.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.958" offset="2072619">I think that is important and I think clearly there has to be stopping point somewhere to the imposition of judicial models upon the governmental decision making because it is very expensive and in some circumstances which I would contend, this is one, adds little or nothing to the alternative procedures provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.748" offset="2147851">Now --</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="524.279" offset="2201977">Yes, and I supposed it is socially expensive because I think in this case for example if one were required to continue payments until an oral evidentiary hearing could be had, one would pay a lot of money to beneficiaries who claim the hearing only for the purpose of keeping the payments going and I think that imposes a social cost independent of money upon the erosion of individual character.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.897" offset="2308452">But in this case which involves one of these massive programs with thousands -- hundreds of thousands determinations in it, I think we face something not like the ordinary hearing due process case although of course this Court has had cases similar to this before.</text>

            <text syncTime="590.962" offset="2468635">Well, I think the thought was that the claimant there might actually under the new procedures be paid and the case would be mooted by that.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.983" offset="2508759">And these are those new procedures?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="602.763" stopTime="917.443">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="602.763" offset="2515865">These are the new procedures Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.786" offset="2531956">And I think it is important to see the kinds of safeguards they provide and the kinds of results they produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.543" offset="2571035">The act provides that the initial determination after a man has been qualified, a worker has been qualified for disability payments, he is told if there is any possibility of recovery from his medical disability that he will examined to see if recovery has occurred because if disability ceases, the payments cease and the Congress has mandated that state agencies were used for making the initial the termination about the cessation of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.332" offset="2682108">And the reason for that is they want to draw these workers into vocational rehabilitation therapy and training and those are primarily the state agencies that are used for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.847" offset="2724217">So that a state agency, working under standards and procedures laid down by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare requests the worker to supply information periodically on a questionnaire that shows his present condition, his medical treatment and medical restriction placed upon him and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.962" offset="2792658">If that questionnaire does not show clear cut recovery, the state agency then obtains information from the treating physician of the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.789" offset="2831946">It may obtain independent consulting examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.483" offset="2846784">In this case of course the initial the termination was made up of the basis of a previous medical record which was on the files.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.222" offset="2873742">The respondent’s current answers to the questionnaire about his condition, the current report of his treating physician and the report of an independent psychiatric consultant who was called in by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.985" offset="2924733">Now, this material when it is gathered, is then reviewed by a state agency team which consists of another physician and a trained disability examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.818" offset="2968096">If the worker is no longer disabled in their opinion after examining his record and I should say that the only issue is one in fact the medical, the statute requires that disability be proved or disapproved by medical evidence and not by other kinds of intuitions, as evidence that is well presented in other words in a written record.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.338" offset="3066212">If they decide that that claimant is probably not disabled and they think he is not then form of that tentative conclusion, they provide him with a summary of the evidence and they provide ten days for him to respond in writing and they tell him that if he wishes additional time because of the difficulty of procuring the evidence he needs he may have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.995" offset="3152834">They also tell him he can get his questions answered at the Local Social Security Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.546" offset="3174986">Now here, as at all of the stages of this process, the worker is entitled to be assisted by a counsel or by any other representative that he chooses, it is often is by Union Representatives or somebody of that sort and that person is entitled to examine all the evidence in the file including the medical evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.256" offset="3241860">Respondent here declined to offer any additional evidence other than to assert that he did not have a back sprain, he actually had arthritis of the spine.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.791" offset="3271953">Many workers do offer additional evidence and often get the initial the termination of no disability reverses.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.948" offset="3304658">But if the tentative conclusion of the state examining team is not changed, the report is forwarded to the Social Security Administrations Bureau of Disability Insurance where it is reviewed to make sure that it is in conformity with National standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.196" offset="3365576">If that office thinks that perhaps the decision should have been favorable to the work, but was not, it has no legal power to change it, but it may and does send the case back for reconsideration and I believe about half of the cases in fact for reconsideration are reconsidered favorably to the worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.848" offset="3436211">If however the Social Security Administration accepts the the termination of no disability, it notifies the worker in writing, states the basis for its initial determination and specifies his right to seek further review.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.693" offset="3495561">At that stage, benefits are terminated although there is a two-month grace period.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.521" offset="3514891">After the month in which he ceased to be disabled, that grace period may sometimes run by them or it may still have some time to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.781" offset="3555956">Respondent of course at this stage filed suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.098" offset="3569226">He had a right to the following additional remedies which he did not elect to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.245" offset="3589811">He can ask for a reconsideration, he gets it automatically.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.221" offset="5205745">I think very little would be gained and I think a very great deal would be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.180" offset="5221523">The issue was medical condition which is not an issue that an administrative law judge gets a great deal of information about by looking at a man in a room, even the demand comes he need not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.004" offset="5260811">And indeed, the decision cannot rest upon the administrative law judges to look at the man and feeling about his condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.384" offset="5290382">It has to rest upon medical evidence so that the probate of evidence here is the kind that can be in writing and can be challenged in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.420" offset="5338447">And he not only has his own doctor, his treating physician and any consulting doctor that Social Security has asked for, the state agency has asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.779" offset="5371884">He gets a doctor who reviews the record at initial the termination period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.380" offset="5390379">Now, I think there is no significant likelihood that any claim is going to be damaged significantly by the timing of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.970" offset="5424651">I have been looking at these briefs and it seems to me, all of the briefs are a little unrealistic about what the reversal rate is in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.650" offset="5451401">Our brief suggests that the error rate in the initial determination is 12.2% measured against what happens later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.804" offset="5492047">But I think it is really more realistic to look at this process at the reconsideration stage because a worker is terminated and can get reconsideration rather quickly and any impact he may feel is really almost de minimis at that stage and in addition to that, the reconsideration stage is the same kind of a paper record determination that occurs at initial determination stage so that the reversal rights from thereon to the oral argument, I think to the oral hearing is the relevant one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.478" offset="5634676">And if you look at that reversal rate, there are 1,101 workers who succeeded at the oral hearing, having lost at the initial stage out of about 35,000 termination decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.429" offset="5698519">So that we have an oral hearing that cured mistakes at a 3.3 reversal rate and if you measure that against all determinations concerning disability made in the system that year, about 150,000, you get a harmful error rate of 7/10 of 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.817" offset="5784096">Now, the worker who receives, who wins at the oral evidentiary hearing or indeed the reconsideration, but the worker who wins the oral evidentiary hearing stage receives all his back payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.104" offset="5825265">Now, it will be nice to say I suppose that the system must be perfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.132" offset="5845327">Nobody must ever be terminated no matter how temporarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.635" offset="5867375">But indeed, I do not think any legal process or any chemical process or any industrial process ever can afford to remove the last bit of impurities in that process against the extraordinary expensive, indeed up against the defeat, the end of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.223" offset="5921709">I cannot put for approximate dollar cost on both sides of this due process equation and I think that is not exactly an inhuman thing to do because these claimants are not in the position of the welfare recipients in Goldberg against Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.517" offset="5990882">This program is not based upon need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.215" offset="6001644">It maybe alternate forms of income in the family or to the worker and in addition if there is a worker who loses his disability temporarily, he has available state, local and other forms of welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.616" offset="6051277">So that we are not -- that puts a floor under his income, so we are not dealing with the kind of stark human suffering that was perceived to be the alternative in Goldberg against Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.390" offset="6098402">And that means that in this case, I think the dollar amounts are real proxy for the interest that go into the due process balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.013" offset="6136854">As I said, 11,101 workers, one reversal at the evidentiary hearing in calendar '73.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.470" offset="6170709">Now, our brief is a little misleading, but the appendix is much clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.153" offset="6189412">It apparently takes 10 to 11 months to get an oral evidentiary hearing after the initial termination and part of that time -- part of that average time is clear on page 12(a) of the appendix to our brief, is waiting for the worker to asked for an oral evidentiary hearing since he has about six months to do so, but it is 163 days as the median time from request for an oral hearing to decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.224" offset="6305709">But if we take say 11 months which appears to be roughly as the period of time that worker might be without payments and there are 11,101 workers, it turns out that, since we are dealing with the stream of payments so that only half of the payments are outstanding, that is the full amount he ultimately would be due is not outstanding all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.039" offset="6416991">It turns out that there must have been total payments withheld during 1973 that were later said to be due to workers $2,028,000.00 or an average of $1,842.00 per claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.619" offset="6487313">Now, these workers recapture that money at the end of the period so that they did not lose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.684" offset="6507584">What they did lose was the use of the money and as I say I think it means something to talk about that because these people do have alternative welfare systems or systems that deal with the needy or often their forms of income, they lost the use of the money and that 8% interest on that stream of monthly payments means that for all claimants in that year about $162,000 or $147.00 per worker was lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.846" offset="6636211">Now, you have to measure that of course against a cost to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.159" offset="6649481">HEW estimates that putting in full evidentiary hearings, including the loss of $23 million in -- the estimated loss of $23 million in over payments that cannot be covered, some of them maybe recovered and they estimate the total cost of the administrative machinery of bureaucracy and the lost payments to be between $15 and $25 million annually at current rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.327" offset="6738088">If we take that, take the median figure there of $20 million cost annually, in order to save benefits to workers of a 163,000, we have a trade off in costs of 122 to one which does not seem to me to be terribly good trade off and it may be low because it does not really take account I think of the full scope of the incentive to ask for evidentiary hearing to keep the benefits flowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.570" offset="6855117">But I think it does not make a great deal of sense in due process terms which is an intensely practical subject to spend a $122.00 which could have gone to other recipients to save $1.00 to that occasional deserving beneficiary.</text>
