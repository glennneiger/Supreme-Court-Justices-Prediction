            <text syncTime="18.494" offset="177232">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.392" offset="188831">This appeal presents the issue whether legislatively created rebuttable presumptions in civil cases will continue to be hospitably treated by the Courts as long as there is some rational connection between the facts proven and the facts presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.273" offset="260406">Appellant, the Commissioner of Social Services of the State of New York appeals to preserve his position that this established standard is the appropriate measure for judging rebuttable presumptions in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.539" offset="317458">It also his position that the statute, the presumption in Section 131-11 of New York Social Services Law which was declared invalid on its face by a three-judge District Court on the motion for summary judgment is in fact valid under the established standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.838" offset="390705">The presumption is contained in a statute governing eligibility for public assistance in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.620" offset="421738">The statute provides that a person who voluntarily terminates his employment or reduces his earning capacity for the purpose of obtaining public assistance or increasing his grant is ineligible for public assistance for a period of 75 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.659" offset="493941">The presumption which was declared invalid below is an evidentiary rule for determining whether the purpose of the person in quitting his job was to obtain public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.492" offset="541275">That presumption is triggered only when the person voluntarily terminates his job and when he applies for public assistance within 75 days, then and only then is he presumed to have terminated for the purpose of obtaining public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.837" offset="614627">The statute applies to applicants for AFTC as well as to the state created Home Relief Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.588" offset="645660">However, no plaintiff was an applicant for AFTC and the specific statutory and regulatory provisions apply differently in the cases of AFTC applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.592" offset="685680">Both parties now agree that the Court below erred in extending its order to include AFTC applicants and question number three is no longer an issue between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.442" offset="737089">Therefore, we will address ourselves solely to the application of this presumption to applicants for the state aid at Home Relief Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.299" offset="776481">Home Relief is the assistance provided by New York State to persons who are not eligible for federal categorical assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.815" offset="810545">That this persons who Congress has not deemed to be the most needy people and because it is totally supported by the public moneys from the treasuries of the state and local governments in New York, the terminations of eligibility are totally governed by State Law and the issue presented in this Court is only the validity of that state law under the constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.069" offset="1567574">There is an injunction against appellant from specifically requiring a person to produce evidence of the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.497" offset="1593278">Therefore, while there is a general duty to produce each element of evidence to prove each element of eligibility, the eligibility under 131-11, that is the purpose for which you terminated your employment, cannot be produced or at least there is a considerable cloud on a local agent who required the production on the one hand or on the other who made a determination unfavorable to the applicant when the record was silent as to his purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.993" offset="1723263">That is the effect of the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.421" offset="1729010">Now, while we agree with the Court that the presumption did not add to the procedural burdens.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.899" offset="3750888">If we talk about the second face, yes that is true, except for the fact that it is not the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.676" offset="3778055">First of all the presumption was deemed necessary by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.574" offset="3789654">It may seem petty at the stage when we are in this high court to discuss the minute service that it performs of clarification and uniformity, but the legislature did deem it necessary and did formally in its sovereign power enact this presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.728" offset="3850258">Therefore, for a court to enjoin it and declare it invalid, there has to be something unconstitutional and that very decision itself demands reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.113" offset="3891740">Secondly, the presumption as the face in the statute itself may not be essential, but the idea of the presumption is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.014" offset="3927371">The idea that the person can be forced to have the burden of proof, the burden of coming forward and in the presence of silence on that subject, he can be deemed to have terminated for the purpose of obtaining public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.673" offset="3973974">Those are the three functions of the presumption and those are not frivolous. So those are the two reasons why this appeal is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.181" offset="4004067">I understand, Your Honors, impatience with such an innocuous presumption and it is frankly been our patience from the beginning of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.852" offset="4046698">We have been more patient maybe we would not be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.903" offset="4062894">I do want because very obviously valid presumption was declared invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.093" offset="4091629">I do not want to miss my opportunity to explain to you why in very simple terms it is valid and that is that the relationship between the facts proven of voluntary termination and the early application for public assistance why they have an internal rationality and it is clear that income from employment is so important to us all; rich, middle class, poor that we do not forgo that major source of income without some idea of where our next source of income will come.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.934" offset="4227048">If after voluntarily giving up that one major source of income, we shortly thereafter appeal and apply for another major source of income, it is rational within the terms of the constitutional rule to assume that the reason that we gave up the one source of income was to make ourselves eligible for the second source of income as long as we have an opportunity to present evidence to the contrary that this was not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.496" offset="4341255">Secondly, there is a tamper relationship between these two actions which has long been the basis of many rebuttable presumptions which are cited in our brief and in many future administrative schemes, it is important that this device is not the clouded by a decision such as that rendered by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.613" offset="4445745">Therefore, it is clear that this rebuttable presumption allows for the individualized determinations which this Court has so long favored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.790" offset="4490467">Irrebuttable presumptions have been criticized just because they do not provide that kind of individualized determinations and it is surprising to be found here, having to defend under the due process clause, the very individualized determinations which have so long been held up as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.336" offset="4576671">The appellees also claim that the presumption is invalid under the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.706" offset="4606137">While the court below did not reach that question, analysis under the equal protection clause only makes more cogent the validity of this presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.835" offset="4642604">First of all the equal protection standard is the same standard as the due process standard of rationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.397" offset="4668935">Secondly, if we look at the classifications in the statute, we see how reasonable the statute is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.235" offset="4696207">The distinctions are between people who quit their jobs and people who do not quit their jobs, very closely related to the purpose of the statute, which is to deter people from leaving their job without the means of subsistence in the near future, to encourage them to provide for themselves in the near future and to limit the finite resources of the state to people most in need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.664" offset="4794009">And the second classification under the statute is the difference between people who recently quit their employment and became eligible for public assistance and those who not so recently quit their job to become eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.462" offset="4841134">Both of those are not attackable as classifications, which could in any conceivable sense violate the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.104" offset="4903724">I do want to point that the procedures for dealing with the presumptions are also at issue here in a limited sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.376" offset="4944788">The Mobile Turnipseed rule, which is the rule of rationality, which we have discussed, is a two-fold rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.979" offset="4975195">One, it requires that a presumption have a rational relationship between the facts proven and the facts presumed and the second part of that rule, is that there must be an opportunity to rebut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.425" offset="5032978">Well, the Court below did not find that there was not enough opportunity to rebut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.205" offset="5048129">There were some footnotes which made some suggestions that we feel were unjustified and furthermore to demonstrate the clear validity of this presumption, we did discuss the procedures for rebuttal in our brief and they were framed this question number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.923" offset="5115002">However, those -- that question only relates to the statute and regulations on their face not as to the statute in regulation as applied which were issues of fact, debated in the court below and not available for decision on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.430" offset="5185010">In general, we should look at the context of these hearings that this is an administrative proceeding for an application for state created benefits and that the procedure before the Social services department is informal and the hearing regulations, the regulations regarding that informal procedure, make it clear that no finding of an eligibility can be rendered without a fair opportunity given to the applicant to rebut furthermore that decision is subject to supervisory review in all respects it meets the standards of Tot versus New York State Labor Department and those standards are stricter than are necessary in this case which is an application proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.276" offset="5336416">Furthermore, there is a fair hearing procedure in the state court which is regulated now and during the entire dependency of this suit by an order of Judge Motley of the Southern District Court and in case in which applicants all were members of the class protected, Nelson versus Sugarman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.165" offset="5420008">Therefore, we regard this presumption as a clearly valid exercise of the legislature’s prerogative to establish evidentially rules and as such we request that the decision below be reversed in all respects, I would like to reserve my additional time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.428" offset="10285053">The facts show that the persons with health problems very often terminate employment and wind up applying for a Home Relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.883" offset="10322878">And in fact the study showed that is number one reason why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.759" offset="10342313">In evaluating the rationality of the presumption, however, the Court has always looked to the facts in the record and the Court has looked to the facts in the case and in the history of the similar presumptions and the Court has looked to legislative records and to other sources of information to ascertain whether common experience and commonsense, present day experience support the presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2604.642" offset="10521827">Plaintiff Milne had a record of 17 years of continuous employment and this illustrates that the presumption was neither easy to rebut nor rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.049" offset="10591521">Not only is it contrary to commonsense that people would leave their jobs in order to qualify for welfare benefits, but looking at the nature of the Home Relief program in New York in its totality, there is simply nothing in that program that would cause us to depart from the commonsense approach to the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.753" offset="10686294">The entire Home Relief program is based upon the concept of less eligibility and that means that generally speaking, the program will be less desirable than working for a living.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.779" offset="10742405">For instance as a precondition for receiving any benefits a person first register for any available work and even if there is unemployment in the local economy, he maybe assigned to perform full time work at a public works project or work relief program for no extra pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.534" offset="10837490">Also the Home Relief program has a stringent means test and the applicant must generally have depleted all of his savings, his assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.249" offset="10888272">He maybe disqualified for owning an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.595" offset="10897676">If he owns has equity in a home, he will have to assign it to the Department of Social Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.964" offset="10919201">All of these factors make it very undesirable for a person to give up personal possessions in order to qualify for public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.955" offset="10955146">Finally the benefits themselves which are rent allowance plus $94.00 a month or about $3.10 a day are simply not the sort of benefit that would cause a person to ordinary leave his employment for the purpose of qualifying for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.464" offset="11021183">Indeed, the benefits themselves are set at the scale to provide only for the bare necessities of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.056" offset="11051485">When one looks at the entire picture of the Home Relief program, the means test, the amount of benefits, the work rules and the other factors, that intangible factors perhaps the stigma, all of these factors when they are combined with the ordinary reasons for terminated employment merely re-affirm that what commonsense tells us, that people just would not to quit work in order to qualify for the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.838" offset="11178649">There is no evidence in the record to support the presumption and there is no evidence in legislative record to support it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.296" offset="11656481">Well, the position of the President's Commission has been tested by a massive study in New Jersey in which the United States Office of the Economic Opportunity spent $8 million over a three-year period to test the precise question whether people would quit their jobs in order to qualify for welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.379" offset="11744775">Basically there are two ways to determine, I guess, whether people would quit work to qualify for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.475" offset="11769226">One would be to offer them a generous benefit without a work rule which is what that experiment did and the other way is to look at people who apply for welfare and find out why they are applying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.103" offset="11815724">Alright, both ends are those -- of those experiences we see that people have not quit work in order to qualify for welfare benefits and interviews of people who do a apply for welfare benefits and exhaustive studies for the reasons why people apply for welfare benefits all come up with commonsense reasons that people apply for welfare benefits because they could not find a new job, because they were not covered by unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.410" offset="11920945">The number one reason in New York is health reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.217" offset="11936200">These kinds of reasons are quite independent of any desire or motive to actually qualify for the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.380" offset="11964831">Also the experience under the work programs have found that most of people who are asked to go out and work actually are complying with the rules and so we really submit that the available information when there is nothing to support the presumption and does confirm what common sense and common experience tell us that presumption is irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.993" offset="12123237">Plaintiffs also contend that this presumption is an unfair rule to impose against the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.084" offset="12155629">In Goldberg against Kelly, the Court stressed that fact finding procedures should be flexible and they should be geared to the capacities of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.147" offset="12195858">We have here a class of persons who are not highly educated and who are not high income persons, they are unlikely to be represented and they are unlikely to understand a sophisticated rule of procedure like presumption that was invoked against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.325" offset="12288645">That the defendant has shown absolutely no legitimate justification for the practical use of this presumption and in fact the defendants accepted if Deputy Commissioner swore in the Court below and I quote from page 452 of the appendix of the bottom page, the very last sentence, Executive Deputy, Mahler swore, “it also clear that determinations are based on of evidence and not an presumption or legal conclusions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.377" offset="12460844">And my adversary concedes at the top of page 18 of her reply brief that it would be possible to make the determination without the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.552" offset="12501490">The record shows that the presumption allows the exercise of our obituary power by case workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.176" offset="12535972">I do not think that any other conclusion can be reached to reviewing this record and the state concedes as much that the overwhelming majority of these instances where erroneous determination and adjectives are used that the presumption is repugnant, that used the presumption was repugnant of the statute, I assume she means the first sentence of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.019" offset="13163433">Yes, I just have two things Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.590" offset="13177644">The first, is I want to point out to the Court the regulations that existed before the decision of the Court below which did make explicit the way the facts were found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.389" offset="13220902">They appear in appendix, but they also appear more conveniently at our brief from pages 45 through 47 and those are regulations with regard to this specific statute and the general regulation for how a determination of eligibility is made appear as an appendix to our brief at pages 1(a) and following, particularly I want to draw the Court's attention to the provisions of Section 3518 then 18 NYCRR, appearing at pages 4(a) and 5(a) which describes how determinations of eligibility are made and which make clear that there could be no determination of eligibility unless the agent found that the applicant did not produce a credible evidence to overcome the presumption and further more the agent is required to make investigation and to verify all conditions of eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.821" offset="13450571">With regard to this specific statute, the pre-existing regulations gave specific examples of kinds of reasons for leaving employment which would overcome the presumptions, such as illness, the payment of minimum wages and so forth and the regulation went on and said Local District of course should not consider this list as exhausting the possibilities under which a voluntary or provoked discharge is not subject to sanction, but should continue to exercise reasonable discretion considering such factors as the lapse of time between termination of employment and the application for assistance that means something less 75 days, if the difference between 60 days and 15 a substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.632" offset="13625800">And also in attempt to resolve the differences with the employer which led to the termination, ability to verify reasons alleged for termination and so forth as reasons -- as judgments as to whether or not the presumption has been overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.773" offset="13682434">So the regulations were specific regarding the presumption and it was only after the decision of the court below that the determination had to made without regard to burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.224" offset="13728200">I know that all of us have discussed this experimental data which is bit far afield exhaustively for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.122" offset="13751815">You have been very patient, but I want to a point out that the major error in all the experimental data is that they come up with the findings that most people would not quit their jobs and most people would not apply for public assistance and even if that is so when we have no reason to doubt it we are dealing here only with people who did quit their job and did apply for public assistance, and therefore, all of that material is irrelevant.</text>
