            <text syncTime="33.820" offset="238569">I am Barbara A. H. Smith, Assistant Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.271" offset="256437">I represent the Petitioners Theodore Ristaino and Frank Hall in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.070" offset="275558">The procedural history of this case began in June of 1970, when James Ross and two co-defendants were brought to trial in the Superior Court of Massachusetts, upon indictments charging armed robbery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and assault with intent to murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.429" offset="336998">Prior to trial, counsel for the defendant James Ross as well as counsel for the co-defendants requested that the trial judge impose certain questions to the perspective jurors upon voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.775" offset="382451">One of the seven questions proposed by council for Ross touched upon the issue of possible racial bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.120" offset="407738">The question was, are there any of you who would believe that a white person is more likely to tell the truth than a black person.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.607" offset="445772">The trial judge declined to pose any of these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.478" offset="457266">Following trial at which the defendants did not testify or offer a defense, they were convicted.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Ms. Barbara A. H. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="100.656" offset="505958">A general question as to this, whether the jurors were sensible of any bias or prejudice was propounded to the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.389" offset="536887">This was coupled with instructions as to the meaning of the first question to be posed by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.369" offset="568757">That is the trial judge in this case is as opposed to the Ham case, did not simply say, I have the clerk answer the question, are you sensible to any bias or prejudice but in an effort to focus their attention on what this question meant, he did explain the instructions as this panel of voir dire.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.328" offset="728626">It is statutory to I think which came as a surprise to me coming from a western state but we will take a day or two to making a jury-- are there just so many questions that are put in their prescribing a statute?</text>

          <turn speaker="barbara_a_h_smith" startTime="168.418" stopTime="666.787">
            <label>Ms. Barbara A. H. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="168.418" offset="777005">Yes, You Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.080" offset="779617">And anything additional is left within the digression of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.896" offset="814935">I may continue with procedural history. Following conviction, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed that conviction, Ross then filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this course raising the issue of the refusal of the trial judge to ask a proposed question.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.566" offset="873553">On January 22nd 1973 this court granted certiorari and summarily vacated the judgment of conviction and remanded the case to the Supreme Judicial Court for reconsideration in light of Ham versus South Carolina, which this court decided five days previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.320" offset="936561">Upon remand the Supreme Judicial Court addressed the issue of whether the Ham decision required reversal on that ground that the trial judge refused to ask perspective jurors questions concerning possible racial prejudice, and again they affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.302" offset="992567">Ross then filed the second petition for writ of certiorari in this court with Justice’s Marshall, Brennan and Douglas dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.324" offset="1024646">In January of 1974, Ross filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Federal District Court, in District of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.471" offset="1057142">In June of 1974, the Court ordered that the writ shall issue, based upon the theory of the trial judge to ask the proposed questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.324" offset="1084623">The respondent below Ristaino appealed to the First Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed visiting Judge Moore from the Second Circuit dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.053" offset="1119522">A petition for certiorari on behalf of Ristaino was then filed in this court and granted in May of 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.267" offset="1148361">The principle issue in this case involves the conflicting interpretations, accorded this court’s decision in Ham versus South Carolina by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts and the Federal District Court and First Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.807" offset="1202487">These interpretations involved the scope and the applicability of the Ham decision, and a resulting retroactive or prospective application to be accorded at that decision even in fact the Federal Court’s interpretation is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.632" offset="1257867">On remand, Supreme Court of Massachusetts, considered this case in the light of the Ham decision and held this to the scope with the Ham decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.219" offset="1292139">We do not believe that the Ham case announced a new broad constitutional principle requiring the questions designed to discover possible racial prejudice, be put to perspective jurors in all state criminal trials when the defendant is black.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.035" offset="1351490">Such questions are constitutionally required only when the defendant is a special target for racial prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.288" offset="1380433">As to complying with fundamental fairness the court found that the judges questions and the instructions to the perspective jurors, were under the circumstances of the Ross case, commensurate with Fourteenth Amendment Requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.595" offset="1429648">However, the Federal District Court held that the petitioner Ross had a constitutional right to have the issue of racial prejudice specifically call to the attention of the perspective jurors on the voir dire examination, and on that basis ordered that the writ issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.533" offset="1497462">The First Circuit held in substance that where the defendant is black and charged with a violent crime against a white, in this particular case a security officer, failure to ask specific questions is error of constitutional dimension requiring release of a convicted defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.936" offset="1567052">The petitioners submit that the Supreme Judicial Court’s interpretations of the scope of Ham is correct for following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.645" offset="1593906">In Ham this court was presented with a very novel fact pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.594" offset="1609684">Jean Ham was a young, bearded, black civil rights activist, he was well known in the community from South Carolina, he was well known for his civil rights activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.248" offset="1648345">His sole defense was that he had been framed, and that law enforcement officers were out to get him because of his civil rights activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.469" offset="1685230">Thus, the court was presented a case in which race was a consideration, in which the credibility of dark defendant was directly pitted against the white law enforcement officers who he maintain were out to get him and framing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.900" offset="1742908">Within this factual framework, the trial judge in Ham, refused to pose the questions requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.872" offset="1766837">And nor did he give any instructions as to the meaning of the general question, as to bias or prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.840" offset="1794631">Now the majority opinion in Ham utilized very specific language, this court held in this case under the facts shown by this record, due process of the Fourteenth Amendment required that the defendant be permitted to have the jurors interrogated on the issue of racial bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.907" offset="1862967">Petitioners suggest that this language is not to be dismissed as mere common judicial locutions, as did the federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.156" offset="1891911">But this Court meant what exactly what it said, that the Court traditionally uses such words of limitation when they are rendering a decision which is required by the particular fact pattern presented to them, when they are rendering a decision solely within the confines of the Due Process clause, fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.983" offset="1963277">We would suggest that this court neither held nor suggested that the constitution conferred a right in every case to have this specific question address the possible racial prejudice put to perspective jurors We further suggest that by basing its decision on the Fourteenth Amendment, rather than the Six Amendment right to an impartial jury as urged by petitioner Ham in his petition for certiorari and in the brief to this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.547" offset="2065468">That the Court indicated its intention to limit its decision to cases involving special circumstances, as did the case in Ham.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.019" offset="2107369">Finally, we would suggest that this Court’s action on Ross’ initial petition for writ of certiorari indicates that its rule in Ham was in fact limited to a particular fact pattern, and that no new per se constitutional rule was there in announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.676" offset="2170063">For this court vacated the Ross decision and remanded, it did not reverse outright, and we would suggest that the vacation was made so that the Supreme Judicial Court could reconsider the fact pattern in Ross within light of Ham.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.572" offset="2249579">Petitioners therefore suggest that the scope of the Ham decision is limited to those cases involving circumstances with the probability of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.761" offset="2278314">It is not sufficient to mention to require a deviation from the normal voir dire procedure, which is traditionally left within the digression of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.851" offset="2314677">We would suggest that the voir dire procedure employed in this case complied with fundamental fairness, as required by the Due Process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.853" offset="2346755">In course of the discussion between counsel and the trial judge as to whether this questions would be asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.129" offset="2371832">The trial judge asked the counsel for a co-defendant whether there was anything peculiar to the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.468" offset="2401194">The response was no, just as the victim is white and the defendants are black.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.716" offset="2418121">Counsel for Ross brought no peculiar or special circumstances with the attention of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.661" offset="2445916">Further, the trial judge indicated he would give preliminary instructions on the meaning of the first question to be asked by the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.654" offset="2477890">In substance then instruction was that each of the jurors must remember they were under oath, that they had an absolute duty to render a fair and impartial verdict based upon the evidence heard in the courtroom, not on any extraneous factors, no bias, or prejudice of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.485" offset="2553227">That the clerk in asking the first question would be given an opportunity to inform the court if you cannot or if you serious doubt that you can render a fair and impartial verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.583" offset="2593664">He directed them to examine all aspects of the case, quoting; everything you know about the case, both in the courtroom from what I have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.201" offset="2628146">If any doubt, you have the duty to inform the court by standing or raising your hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.226" offset="2648208">The defendants were then asked to stand, so clearly the jurors were aware that they were in fact black.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.369" offset="2680809">In fact, a number of jurors did raise their hands and indicate their inability to render a fair and impartial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.990" offset="2707245">One for admitted racial prejudice, two for general prejudice, seven for previously formed opinion, seven because their relationship with law enforcement authorities, and one because of employment at the University where the crime originally occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.164" offset="5719999">Since apparently is this court’s practice when presented with a case dealing with both retroactivity and the application of a constitutional principle, and to deal with the retroactivity issue first, I shall do that in my argument dealing with the retrospective application of Ham versus South Carolina to the Ross situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.874" offset="5802755">The test stated by counsel for the Commonwealth is found in Stovall versus Deno, and that sets out a three-prong test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.418" offset="5832952">Setting out the purpose to be served by the new standards, the effect upon the reliance of the old standards, and the effect upon the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.710" offset="5866180">Believe this test was further clarified in the Desist versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.099" offset="5883735">In that the three-prong, of the three-prong test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.699" offset="5894079">The first prong, and that is the purpose to be served by the new rule is to be given foremost importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.957" offset="5923127">And then in William versus the United States, this Court said that if the major purpose of the constitutional rule goes to the truth finding function and substantially affects the accuracy of the guilty verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.881" offset="5978820">Then with the rule be given complete retroactive application, without regard to the effect on the administration justice or the good faith reliance by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.300" offset="6028557">Now it is interesting to know that the issue of retroactivity of Ham was never raised by the commonwealth, in either the second Supreme Judicial Court case after remand by this Court, or by the First Circuit in the First Circuit Court of Appeals or in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, based on the petition for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.155" offset="6123957">It was raised in the First Circuit only as a side and never briefed by the commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.985" offset="6151228">I think what this indicates, is that the commonwealth first of all assumed retroactivity of the Ham case and second I think it dilutes their claim of the calamitous effect on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.239" offset="6200234">Because that issue was never raised, never briefed in any of the court except this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.566" offset="6225521">In fact the Supreme Judicial Court for the commonwealth in the recent case of Commonwealth versus Lumley, states that they believe the limited rule announced by Ham is to be given complete retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.816" offset="6282572">Ross believes that the denial of the impartial jury or even the likelihood of an impartial jury or the denial of an impartial jury, goes to the heart of the truth-finding function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.507" offset="6329383">And so effects the accuracy of guilty verdicts that Ham should be given complete retrospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.783" offset="6362402">The commonwealth relies on two cases in this regard; one is Daniels versus Louisiana and the second is De Stefano versus Woods, to establish the argument that Ham is not the be give retrospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.732" offset="6414229">Now the question presented in Daniels was the retrospective application of Taylor versus Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.419" offset="6437008">This Court denied retroactive application of Taylor, saying that until Taylor no cases held that the exclusion of women from a jury deprive the defendant of a Sixth Amendment right to an impartial trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.534" offset="6489462">That is not true here, there was no previous case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.403" offset="6504926">This Court said that reliance on past decisions of this court such as Hoyt versus Florida, precluded retroactive application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.513" offset="6537318">Here there is no previous decision to the contrary, in fact the previous decision to Ham, Aldridge versus United States, was in support of the Ross claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.124" offset="6583816">They also say—you also said in Taylor that the substantial impact on the administration of justice and it would cause enormous burdens for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.396" offset="6624881">The commonwealth in its brief on page nine says that therefore the retroactive application of the Ham case would require reversal of every case in the commonwealth, involving a defendant who is a member of the minority class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.829" offset="6686634">That is not just correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.656" offset="6693948">In this regard, the First Circuit decision in Ross is much narrower than the Commonwealth asserts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.003" offset="6723310">First, it only applies to black defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.302" offset="6736476">Second, only black defendants who are convicted of a violent crime, and third it only applies to jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.752" offset="6766360">Fourth, it only provides for a application where the judge or the clerk asks questions, it is not where a counsel does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.928" offset="6810977">It is my research that approximately in those effects, approximately 17 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.715" offset="6830203">And only when the defendant's counsel has submitted a question as to racial prejudice, and the court had denied that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.686" offset="6954023">The only witness against Ross was no the victim, he could not identify Ross at all, it was only a white gas station attendant who was the witness against Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.162" offset="6999999">And so I think the First Circuit decision would certainly apply in that circumstance.</text>
