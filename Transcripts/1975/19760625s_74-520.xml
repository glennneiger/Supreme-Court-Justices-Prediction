            <text syncTime="15.177" offset="134268">These two cases raise a common question.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.601" offset="143986">In the Fano case which is here from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, Fano was a state prisoner in a medium security institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.719" offset="176482">He was transferred to a maximum security prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.897" offset="189230">In Haymes, which is here on petition to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the prisoner was transferred from one medium security prison to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.166" offset="218278">In each case the inmate brought suit, claiming that the transfer violated his right to liberty under the Due Process Clause and that he was therefore entitled to more procedural due process than he had received in connection with his transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.408" offset="271254">Both Courts of Appeals agreed to the inmate and ordered the transfer canceled.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.997" offset="289644">We reverse both judgments, since in our view no cognizable rights to liberty of either inmate were violated by the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.108" offset="318066">Our reasons are given at greater length in the opinions on file with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.146" offset="334157">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.590" offset="347950">He has been joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall.</text>
