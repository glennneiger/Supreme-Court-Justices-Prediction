            <text syncTime="6.414" offset="130455">If I may before beginning the presentation of the argument in the Waxton Case, simply speak to three question that came up in the previous questioning and specifically questions asked by Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice White about Louisiana practice and a California practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.494" offset="194821">The mystery about the Louisiana practice is no mystery at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.514" offset="210808">It is explicated at page 33 footnote 45,of their brief in Roberts but Louisiana Supreme Court does not review sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.035" offset="244976">It does use a no evidence test to review sufficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.090" offset="261172">Akin to the Thompson v. Louisville test, whether a new trial motion is filed or not, there is not a question whether the evidence is sufficient to support the verdict, it is a no evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.159" offset="309446">There is not a great mystery about it, just that they do not review sufficiency in the normal way.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="68.584" offset="379141">(Inaudible) putting a trial judge, that puts a trial judge in to rather a tight corner, does it not, to say that having let the case go the jury in the first place with instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.446" offset="430550">He now is called upon in a motion for a new trial to decide that there was no evidence to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.248" offset="465763">That is a little different from a sufficiency test, is it not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="94.421" offset="482481">I think it merits to nothing more or less than the difference between the Thompson and Louisville Constitutional no evidence test and the standard state sufficiency test.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="103.109" offset="517276">Would you say then that you are suggesting then that the gloss on their literal test is that it makes it a sufficiency test, is that it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_g_amsterdam" startTime="114.031" stopTime="242.203">
            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="114.031" offset="560953">I think that Louisiana law operationally differs from the law in other states and it needed the trial judge nor the appellant Court exercises the degree of scrutiny over the evidence and over the jury that exists in other states, that is a matter of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.334" offset="630125">The question that Mr. Justice Stewart asked about California practice, the reason that they have two stages in California is that some of the special circumstances may not come out at the guilt phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.607" offset="675265">For example; the defendant committed an unrelated murder, that is one of the special circumstances, but and other reason for the second phase is that at the first phase the jury may not resolve all of the relevant issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.600" offset="719255">For example; a case is punishable by death in California, if it first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.051" offset="749035">It is first degree murder if it is either premeditated and deliberated or felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.986" offset="768783">So what goes to the jury is an alternative submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.999" offset="784770">Premeditation, deliberation or felony murder, then they come back at the penalty stage and even if there is no new evidence presented, they now have to answer both questions cumulatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.240" offset="821759">And the answer to how they do that is very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.284" offset="833985">Because in fact, as Mr. Justice White’s question suggested, there are juries and may have done it again and again who have come back at the second phase with a life sparing verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.667" offset="871497">It is inconsistent with their verdict at the first phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.148" offset="881423">Cold blooded murders where the defendant’s contention was an alibi, where there is no doubt in the facts of the case that a person whoever he was who committed the crime, intentionally premeditatedly and deliberatedly committed a killing in a course of a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.902" offset="936385">The jury then goes ahead and points the defendant guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.715" offset="947670">And then it is asked the question at the penalty phase, that the defending premeditatedly and deliberatedly killed and in the course, the felony comes back, no and spares the defendants life.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.689" offset="987585">Now the third question that we came up on the previous arguments that I would just like to mention to Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.232" offset="1013707">Mr. Justice Powell, we do deal in our reply brief at pages three to six with the question of a homicide rape figures about which you are under arrest and I hope the Court would look at our reply briefs treatment of that subject.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="244.096" offset="1081208">What page?</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_g_amsterdam" startTime="245.051" stopTime="438.538">
            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="245.051" offset="1084969">Pages three to six of the reply brief and a homicide rate has in fact shown a decrease last year for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.133" offset="1113286">But we deal more generally with those figures in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.097" offset="1125198">Now if I may, I said yesterday, that the petitioners in the Texas and Louisiana Cases, may two separated constitutional contentions against their sentences of death, both of those contentions are also made by the petitioners in this present North Carolina Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.676" offset="1211506">Yesterday, I spent all of my time talking about the first of those two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.238" offset="1229792">Today, I would like to devote most of my time to talking about the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.002" offset="1252780">In order to begin that however, I would like to simply summarize, recapitulate, the essence of the first argument in order to distinguish it from the second because although both arguments depend upon characteristics of imposition of the death penalty under the present system putting as we are ready in arbitrariness, they are very different arguments and I think it is important to state them succinctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.187" offset="1353508">Our first argument then is based squarely upon Furman versus Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.488" offset="1382765">The predicate of the argument is arbitrary selectivity in the administration of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.899" offset="1412440">It is not mere selectivity as such, it is arbitrary selectivity by which I mean that certain persons are consigned to die and others are spared call it mercy if you will as the government puts it but other people in a like situations are spared with no meaningful basis to distinguish between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.321" offset="1498122">That is an Eight Amendment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.038" offset="1508989">It is not a Due Process argument because the Eight Amendment unlike the Due Process clause is not concerned with process.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.650" offset="1543366">It is concerned with the results of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.450" offset="1554651">The Eighth Amendment is concerned with punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.858" offset="1568235">It asks whether punishment is cruel and unusual and punishment maybe cruel and unusual even though as Mr. Justice Stevens says, “The results in a particular Case of the process are fair simply looking at that Case in isolation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="381.865" offset="1632287">The Eight Amendment question is whether the result of that process, whether fair or not in isolation is in the perspective of all of the punishments meted out by the system, nevertheless, a cruel unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.697" offset="1683591">Now that is why Furman is consistent with McGautha and that is why Furman is not limited to jury discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.197" offset="1725596">The government suggests in its brief that the in other way to run a system of selecting people to die would be a lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.529" offset="1758928">That is of all people convicted of the first degree murder, you run a lottery and you only kill some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.218" offset="1781707">It is our contention that Furman would outlaw that, just as much as it outlawed the jury discretionary systems involved in Furman and it is our position that Furman outlaw is the present systems before the Court in these five cases because the results are no better than a lottery.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="438.538" stopTime="451.676">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="438.538" offset="1858925">That is it, if you except McGautha to this argument, are you not also accepting the fact that a stantardless exercise of jury discretion is something different from a Lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.100" offset="1905214">It does not but McGautha held that.</text>

            <text syncTime="452.444" offset="1914618">I think that McGautha says -- Mr. Justice Stevens I am not sure that McGautha does say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.774" offset="1947951">I am not sure that McGautha addresses the question whether a lottery would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.803" offset="1964042">It may well be that McGautha is based on precisely the notion as the government suggests that the state can choose any way it sees fit as a matter of Due Process rather than cruel and unusual punishment.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="477.244" offset="2013779">Let me put the question just a little differently then, is your argument predicated on the proposition that standardless discretion is equivalent to a lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.667" offset="2055471">The solicitor general takes precisely the opposite position on there.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.444" offset="2066546">He said discretion is not necessarily capricious?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="493.006" offset="2076786">For Eight Amendment purposes, standardless discretion is equivalent to a lottery and for Eight Amendment purposes, it would be equivalent to a system in which a prosecutor before a trial simply could decide to paper the case capitally or not capitally as he chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.152" offset="2141361">Our point is that the Eight Amendment is not concerned with the way the decision is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.544" offset="2162991">It is concerned with whether at the end of the tunnel you look at it and you say these people are dying like being struck by lightning and these people are living and there is no rational basis for.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.876" offset="2200293">And which ever procedure immediately-</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="525.102" offset="2205204">And any further, it is not at rational basis that a jury of 12 people differentiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.022" offset="2228924">One jury of 12 people found that this group should die and another jury found that they should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.849" offset="2244179">That is not a rational basis --</text>

            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="536.407" offset="2250448">No it is not, the fact is that each individual jury may come in with different standards, different approaches, there is no way to rationalize the system like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.791" offset="2291931">Now, our second argument though is different, our second argument I say, squarely, does not depend on Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.940" offset="2340519">It would be the same whether Furman had been decided or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.938" offset="2356506">The second argument is that the death penalty is an atavistic butchery which has run its course.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.069" offset="2397048">Now, I listened yesterday the argument of Attorney General in Texas and there is something extraordinarily striking about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.583" offset="2435186">Attorney General Texas said yesterday, look at what we use the death penalty for now, we only use it for this limited class of highly serious murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.811" offset="2467996">We do not all use it for all murders anymore; we do not use it for rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.160" offset="2485446">The responding brief in Florida says look at the way we used the death penalty now, we used it for broader range than Texas does but we have got standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.071" offset="2521077">We do not use it the way, we used before Furman, they say it is not surprising that sentences determine under the system condemned by Furman produced uninformed irrational and freakish results. What are we talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="618.276" offset="2577919">We are talking about the way of killing people that was argued for by these very same states in this Court five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.292" offset="2617939">We are talking about penalties for which they were killing people ten years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.641" offset="2635389">We are talking about penalties for which 15 years ago, they were killing 20 people a year and in the 1930s they were killing 200 people a year and we are now told that it is no surprise that they were found to be irrational and arbitrary and uninformed.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.915" offset="2692440">And what will we be told 10 years from now, if the Court sustained these death penalties and we find the system working in a predictable and expectable way that we have outgrown these death penalties, that these death penalties are equally purposeless and in vain.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.957" offset="2752626">Our argument, our second argument which does not depend on Furman, places the death penalty in its historical perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.925" offset="2788466">These new death penalties that we are having urged on is that Solicitor General is seeking to sustain or either just exactly like Furman that is the aggravating, mitigating circumstances which amounts to a process that is ultimately totally discretionary and uncontrolled, or else they are reversions, they are throw backs to the old mandatory death penalty system.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.357" offset="2882194">Now the mandatory death penalty system was repudiated in this country because it was intolerable because mandatory death penalties for crimes were intolerable and because juries would not convict.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.305" offset="3402031">What happened was when given discretion, the systems of American criminal justice so thoroughly repudiated the death penalty, that in 1967 for example; the National Crime Commission concluded that being most salient characteristic of capital punishment was that it was infrequently used.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.008" offset="3464829">This court then as a result of that and I do not think wrong, held in Furman versus Georgia that, that kind of application of death penalty violated the constitution and now indeed the states have responded, but how have they responded?</text>
            <text syncTime="853.068" offset="3517074">They have responded either by maintaining the old discretionary outlets in a new form for whole sale evasion of the use of the death penalty or enacting so called mandatory death penalty schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.020" offset="3572871">In a procedural setting where in fact, all these escape hatches exist prosecutorial discretion, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.059" offset="3597008">Now let me just point out that for our second argument, the existence of discretion and escape hatches and arbitrariness in the selective system is not relevant because of Furman, it is relevant because it explains why and how new statutes can be enacted without a considered judgment that the death penalty ought to be use in the regular and even handed way which would denote acceptability by the public for Eight Amendment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.518" offset="3734831">The Legislatures which have put these penalties in know that they would be averted, wildly, erradicaly, arbitrarily, by a number of selective devices, and all of them cumulatively in these various case, and look at the case before the Court, look at Woodson and Waxton versus North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.965" offset="3804630">I think it is important to take a good hard look at this Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.134" offset="3817377">You have four people who commit a robbery of a package store, Tucker, Carroll, Woodson and Waxton.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.795" offset="3851964">The first one after their apprehension to break the story, to confess, to come clean is Woodson.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.878" offset="3876310">Woodson also happens to be the least culpable from our points of view of the four.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.390" offset="3902328">He goes to trial because it is uncontested that prior to going out to the package store robbery, he was hit by Waxton, hit so his eye was bleeding and he went alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.368" offset="3942243">Now maybe that is why Tucker and Carroll were willing to plead guilty and get life and at the end of this process, they are going to live, they are in prison, and they are going to live, Woodson on the other hand and his lawyer make the judgment that because he has got the most attractive case, because he has got a duress argument that the jury might or might not buy because he did cooperate with the police, they can take the case in front of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.952" offset="4032626">So they go in front of the jury, jury comes back- first-degree murder comes back death and Woodson is going to die.</text>

            <text syncTime="1291.333" offset="5270099">I think that one can argue both ways about whether the narrowing of the statute, cures the Furman problem so long as discretion remains within that class defined by the statute to sentence for life or death.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.170" offset="6997524">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.409" offset="7034409">Several problems which I have with some of the statements by Mr. Amsterdam move me to depart from my earlier notions of how I would proceed in order to put to rest the couple of questions which he may have raised in a minds of the Court, not in mine but perhaps in yours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.251" offset="7109851">As I understood a statement by Mr. Amsterdam and perhaps I misunderstood that he said that in capital cases, the jury system cannot be made rational, I dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.890" offset="7160319">Respondent disputes that, the capital punishment does not affect the operation of the jury system except to make our jurors even more sensitive to their constitutional and sworn responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.445" offset="7218625">If the jury system is not rational and sometimes there are cases in which it results on the called record, seem not rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.403" offset="7262406">Even so, it is the best system known to man, it is in deeply ingrained in our Constitutional system and until a better alternative comes along, respondent urges that petitioners have no right to complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.363" offset="7350282">As I understood Mr. Amsterdam’s argument he indicated that the mandatory death penalty had been repudiated and I was not paying as close attention as I might have perhaps and I am not sure whether he said by this Court or by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.839" offset="7412140">I suggest that in either event it has not yet been repudiated by this Court, though two members of the Court and Furman indicated a preference in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.730" offset="7459683">And the people, at least the people of North Carolina, the respondent State have acted definitely to guarantee a mandatory death penalty in a limited series of Cases and I will talk more about that at an appropriate time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.392" offset="7518406">All the States have responded however to your decision in Furman to assure that in those states in 35 odd states, I understand 36 in July that there will be the right in limited cases to bring forward the ultimate sanction of our criminal justice system, the death penalty for the ultimate crimes..</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.827" offset="7632091">The ultimate crime which present a threat if you will, to our system of government and to the people of our country, I say that in disrespect, may it please the Court that our people are governed by their consent, the preamble to the constitution establishes purposes, including which maintenance of domestic tranquility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.583" offset="7735118">Now, perhaps for those of us who are fortunate, domestic tranquility prevails but to the victim in this crime, there is no domestic tranquility, there is nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.587" offset="7791124">Blank brains have been blown out by small caliber pistol, a close range for no reason except to eliminate a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.377" offset="7826337">That is the only possible logical reason that you can imagine, there was no resistant, she was an elderly woman at 58 years, these are young strong men and they just killed her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.158" offset="7873462">But there has to be a sanction to that kind of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.555" offset="7899062">The assertion by Mr. Amsterdam that Woodson is the least culpable defies my comprehension, much of his argument have at from time to time but I attribute that to my limitations rather that to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.327" offset="7966145">Woodson was outside with a riffle, sitting in the car standing, watch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.359" offset="7998223">He -- according to the testimony of the other man in the car Carroll, he was about to get out and shoot Stancil if he had not pulled him back into the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.229" offset="8041691">A fortuitous happenstance, May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.850" offset="8060186">A lucky bike as it way say on straight that Stancil was not shot with the riffle out run instead of merely wounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.721" offset="8095712">Mr. Amsterdam asked what purpose is served by the trial and by the death penalty in these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.768" offset="8123924">Well, the purposes of retributions, specific deterrents and all the purposes which have been discussed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2105.754" offset="8527777">Thank you Your Honor, the remaining point that I wanted to clarify before beginning for what I have prepared to say has to do with the reasons, the rationale behind two of these men being tried and two being permitted to plead and that is the necessity of meeting the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.576" offset="8659121">Without the testimony of at least one witness and in this case since it could easily have been three against one or one against an absence of any evidence on the other side, not meeting the burden, the state was required to make sort of a deal, some sort of plead bargain in order to be able to prove immediate proper constitutional burden of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.305" offset="8766014">Now, in this particular case, there is no proper basis for complain on the part of the petitioner Woodson, that he was not permitted to plead because he never tried to, his lawyer according to the record, had entered in this negotiations and he promised that he would make some recommendation to his client and the prosecutor anticipated the pleas but one never was forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.082" offset="8853159">It was his decision, certainly not a requirement of Constitutional Law that he be compelled to plead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.467" offset="8878654">In the case of Waxton, he was the trigger man and he was probably the dominant individual in the entire plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.025" offset="8908852">He was the one who actually pulled the trigger according to the testimony of three of the four and he of course said it was his colleague, Tucker who was with him and even if that had been true under North Carolina law, the felony murder rule, he would have been guilty as upfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.387" offset="8970396">The practicality of conviction, however, leads us to require -- prosecutor be able to make the necessary bargain with those that he and his judge pursuant to his sworn, in his experience and his training, determines are those who he can make of deal with who will be willing to testify for the State for conviction, without a conviction of course, (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.228" offset="12397766">Having resulted in this over 200 years of evolution of this country and its judicial system were shocked frankly, that petitioners now say that because things are so fair and because your system is so judicious and because your system is so careful about who finally receives the death penalty, that then is arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.689" offset="12515526">It just does not follow we urge, it is logically fallacious, it is not supported by any evidence that we are able to as assign.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.584" offset="12843102">The last point that I want to make before I conclude is the notion that the existence of the capital punishment in our judicial system being somehow abhorrent to society, there is no evidence that we have found aside from scholarly writings, cited by petitioner, that tends to support that doctrine, kind officers or the solicitor general have submitted documentary evidences and statistical evidence that tends to go all the way, we find that to be a draw if you will that the abhorrence is simply not established if it must be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.599" offset="13019167">We urge to this Court that the fact that the general assemblies, legislatures, of the 35, 36 states and of the Congress in enacting the death penalty in four years and this is not an issue that is been ignored in the past, past over that the Court is required to step in and get somebody’s attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.871" offset="13100251">The attention of the general assembly, the attention of all elected representatives has been focussed on every session of the General Assembly of North Carolina since 1961 and perhaps before that we just did not check that far back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.602" offset="13151242">There has been a Bill introduced to do something with the death penalty, either modify it or eliminate it or change it or do something with it and they all failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.651" offset="13195441">The Bill that it before you today, the law that provides death penalty in this particular situation, passed the senate with only four dissenting votes of 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.584" offset="13247164">The vote in the House were somewhat different and there was conference committee, but the Bill finally came out as a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.087" offset="13277152">The idea that death penalty is abhorrent to the standards of society’s decency is simply not supportable, indeed to strip the States of their ultimate punishment to stem the tide of robberies and murders would more likely offense society.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.296" offset="13433991">We know the law, the law is that the trial judge is not required to submit lessors without evidence, but if he does, the judgment would be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3361.367" offset="13550288">Would you nevertheless under your first argument conclude that the North Carolina statute is less vulnerable than the Louisiana statute, that is what I would understand to be thrust of your argument.</text>

There is a difference between them but they are both well below the line of constitutionality and the difference between them is small compared to the quantum jump that had to be made to get up to constitutionality.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.425" offset="13906494">I simply want to make more points very clear, first of all, to attack a death penalty on Eight Amendment grounds is not to express sympathy for crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.564" offset="13947036">It is not to express coalescence with regard to victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.045" offset="13960933">The death penalty maybe the most -- the greatest obstacle to adequate enforcement of crime in this country today because it saps public conscience and make succinct, we are doing something about serious crime instead of devising other methods of dealing with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.651" offset="14027389">Secondly we are taxed in this case and have been throughout our Eight Amendment presentation with the notion that we were seeking to have this Court, use subjective gut feelings to be a super legislature that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.275" offset="14093949">Our position is the only coherent analytic position of the Eight Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.487" offset="14114742">The government says that the death penalty for Jay Walking would be bad, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.346" offset="14130207">Because there is an emotional feeling that is being invited that that is too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.604" offset="14147239">It cannot be that it is a comparative test such as Solicitor General Bork suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.354" offset="14166256">The Eighth Amendment was written reply only to the federal government not to the State it could have been asking a comparative question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.640" offset="14191333">We submit simply that our argument has a coherent Eighth Amendment base is adequately improperly based on the facts accounts for the needs of law enforcement of protection of victims and under that view, the death penalties is violation to the Eight Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3613.999" offset="14560809">No, I will say that one of the problems with mandatory death penalty statutes and I think we have got a phrase right after this, is though in 80 or 90% of the cases, at a process through, the all of the actors involved, the prosecutor, the jury everybody recognizes a power, an extra legal power and frequently exercise in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.099" offset="14645237">Some poor cases go right through to the mail and nobody recognized they got the power and these people end up dead because nobody realized that all the discretion which is in the system, which is exercised and used by other prosecutors and other juries was even available and that is a very bad thing but is it bad, is it worst than what goes under a system in which overt discretion allows inconsistent judgments with no accountability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.557" offset="14750981">I think they are both bad and as bad, the best I can do.</text>
