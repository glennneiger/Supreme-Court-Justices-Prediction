            <text syncTime="20.035" offset="153707">In 75-491, the Agurs case, the case is here from the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.213" offset="194458">Three months after a jury found the respondent guilty of murdering a man named Sewell, respondent’s lawyer learned that Sewell had a criminal record which if it had been called to the attention of the jury, might have supported the argument that respondent had killed Sewell in self defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.617" offset="268124">Respondent therefore moved for a new trial claiming that the failure of the prosecutor voluntarily to provide defense counsel with Sewell’s prior criminal record deprived the respondent of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.874" offset="325070">The District Court denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.486" offset="335519">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed holding in substance that the information might have affected the jury’s appraisal of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.229" offset="374494">This Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.892" offset="385152">In an opinion filed with the clerk we know that this not a case in which there is any claim that the conviction rests on perjured testimony or that the prosecutor failed to respond to a specific request for information.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.546" offset="435830">In a case such as this in which the only claimed breach of duty by the prosecutor was a failure to volunteer exculpatory information to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.246" offset="470625">We hold that material information must be delivered by the prosecutor to the defense, but that the test of materiality is whether such information gives rise to a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the defendant that would not otherwise exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.749" offset="532587">Since the district judge in this case made it clear that he had no doubt about respondent’s guilt and that Sewell’s prior criminal record was merely cumulative of information already disclosed by the record, he properly denied the motion for a new trial. Accordingly we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.546" offset="619836">Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan joins.</text>
