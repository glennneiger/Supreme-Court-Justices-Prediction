            <text syncTime="27.389" offset="212868">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.481" offset="229273">I am William Douglas Stein, Deputy Attorney General of the State of California, appearing here today on behalf of Jiro J. Enomoto, the Director of our California Department of Corrections.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.945" offset="271069">This case commenced effectively on November 14, 1970 with a major incident in the visiting room of the San Quentin State Prison, involving an inmate named John Wesley Clutchette, who was then confined in our maximum security section.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.396" offset="336898">As a result of that disturbance, a disciplinary hearing was scheduled six days later for November 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.449" offset="361139">On that same date, counsel, who was representing Mr. Clutchette in a state criminal prosecution that was going on at that time, filed a civil rights action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.357" offset="416728">That action sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the disciplinary hearing that was scheduled for that date, a declaratory judgment that the procedures used by our department of that time lacked due process safeguards, an injunction barring such hearings and $30,000 in money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.408" offset="488930">Of course, the temporary restraining order was denied, but an order to show cause did issue, returnable on December 4th why a preliminary injunction should not issue in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.575" offset="533652">The day before I appeared at that order to show cause hearing, the complaint was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.996" offset="555281">The complaint was amended to add one more named plaintiff in the class action allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.576" offset="577642">Since that time, the matter has been considered by the courts as a class action.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.115" offset="643784">It mentions both, the named plaintiffs, Mr. Clutchette and Mr. Jackson, and ordered -- actually ordered expungement of their disciplinary records, ordered specific relief to them and then mentioned plaintiffs generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.446" offset="693103">So, I have taken it that since that opinion and order of the District Court, the matter has been considered as a class action.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.856" offset="1030710">At the close of that, as I say, it was the day before the complaint was amended and at the close of that hearing, the Judge stated that any injunction he issued would in fact be a permanent injunction.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Douglas Stein</label>
            <text syncTime="252.830" offset="1114615">The order to show cause concerned a complaint filed named one plaintiff, John Wesley Clutchette in attack of the conditions or the procedures to be used in his disciplinary hearing on one particular date, November, 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.182" offset="1168010">At the hearing, there was evidence taken that the procedures would not materially be different, but as far as the factual issue that we litigated on December 4, 1970, the only evidentiary hearing ever held in this case, concerned a particular incident and the sole witness that was presented, was the Chairman of the Disciplinary Committee that heard Mr. Clutchette’s complaint.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="287.513" offset="1253378">Well, but that would go to the breadth of the injunction and not to whether it should have been a preliminary as opposed to a permanent?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_douglas_stein" startTime="293.566" stopTime="524.415">
            <label>Mr. William Douglas Stein</label>
            <text syncTime="293.566" offset="1277619">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.463" offset="1289113">Now, as I say, at this evidential hearing we presented or he was called by the petitioners or by the plaintiffs, the man who was the Chairman of the Disciplinary Committee that heard the infraction against inmate Clutchette.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.004" offset="1351285">I think material of the issue, the main issue about whether counsel is required at that hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="316.944" offset="1371138">It is his testimony that the standard Miranda warning was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.991" offset="1387229">That warning had been given in California prisons whenever any disciplinary infraction could be punished as a felony since Dorado case in California which occurred between Escobedo and Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.278" offset="1444385">He was specifically informed that his case appeared to be felony and that it would be or it could be turned over to the local District Attorney who would have a prosecutorial decision to make whether or not to prosecute that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.861" offset="1502795">Clutchette signed a waiver from.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.074" offset="1511572">He signed a from waiving his Miranda rights and he agreed to speak to the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.852" offset="1534769">Now, the Chairman of the committee remembered that inmate Clutchette did asked for certain witnesses to be called and that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.548" offset="1573534">At that time, the procedures do not provide for any testimony taken other than by written document.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.733" offset="1602269">He was unclear as to whether inmate Clutchette requested his attorney's presence, but it has never been litigated between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.974" offset="1627242">The attorney had sent a telegram to the prison, requesting his presence, and of course, as I say, he filed the action, on the day of the hearing, attempting to stop the hearing so that he could be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.828" offset="1670605">So there is no evidence in the record that inmate Clutchette did in fact, asked for the attorney, but we have never challenged that.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.827" offset="1706654">We have always conceded that he did, in fact, asked at the hearing, just the Chairman could not hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.350" offset="1728702">The Chairman testified that had inmate Clutchette refused to waive his Miranda rights, he would not have been questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.875" offset="1762765">That they would have been in that situation made their determination of the disposition, first of all, the finding of guilt or innocence and disposition on the basis of the written reports they had before them, and at that time, all of our disciplinary hearings were conducted on the basis of written reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.800" offset="1822534">There was no live testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.095" offset="1831729">The gist of the written reports, he testified were written, or were read to inmate Clutchette.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.833" offset="1850641">Now, the reports were voluminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.444" offset="1857120">I think, there were 13 to 15 supplemental reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.665" offset="1869972">The rules and regulations of the Director of Corrections require any person having knowledge or seeing incident involving an incident of disciplinary hearing to file a written report.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.699" offset="1914067">They were not given to the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.216" offset="1920127">He was not allowed to see them or read them.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.156" offset="1927964">The material portions were read to him by the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.807" offset="1942488">As I say, the hearing lasted about an hour and the following punishments were imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.018" offset="1963386">Inmate Clutchette was ordered, confined in isolation for 29 days, concurrent with being retained in cell status for 29 days, his privileges were removed for 60 days, and the matter was referred to the District Attorney for prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.476" offset="2025244">The matter was, in fact, never prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.076" offset="2039663">Now, inmate as I pointed out earlier at the start, inmate Clutchette was already housed in our maximum security section.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.771" offset="2062442">So he was retained in the same cell, same type of cell as he had been in before the incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.459" offset="2085116">I believe he was moved to a different cell because isolation requires the removal of personal property from the inmate cell, except for legal materials, religious materials and toilet articles, and I think it was easier to move inmate Clutchette to another blank cell than to remove his goods from his, what then would be property he should not have from his other cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.063" offset="2171530">So I believe he was moved to another cell that was exact same size, shape, cell that he had been housed in before the incident.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="524.415" offset="2200996">In other words, the isolation was carried out then?</text>

            <label>Mr. William Douglas Stein</label>
            <text syncTime="526.894" offset="2210922">Well, isolation and that term was used in California that time meant in the testimony, this is in the record, that all personal property, items of personal property except as I said, for religious materials, legal materials and toilet articles, were removed from the cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.435" offset="2281035">Then he would be, if isolation were the only punishment, he would also be restricted to the cell for 23 hours a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.682" offset="2306008">He would be allowed one hour a day exercise outside the cell, but this next punishment imposed was cell status which alters that and required him to remain in his cell 24 hours a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.746" offset="2346341">There was no outside exercise permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.832" offset="2354596">However, he was not isolated in the sense that he could not speak to other inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.864" offset="2374762">He could not see other inmates' cell next to him as the walls are solid between the cells and there are no cells in that section facing.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.711" offset="2402139">But he could speak through the bars to the people on either side and they exercise up and down the tier and he could talk to an inmate who was exercising in the tier.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.569" offset="2449577">Now, cell status had an additional penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.069" offset="2467549">As I said, the one hour exercise normally allowed inmates and isolation was removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.459" offset="2485103">So for 29 days he had no outside cell exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.054" offset="2499523">He did leave the cell twice a week to shower, for family visits, attorney visits, and for parole board appearances.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.838" offset="2526690">That is allowed on cell status.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Douglas Stein</label>
            <text syncTime="917.274" offset="3772418">The -- there has been one nagging distinction, purported distinction in this case between the Nebraska case that I think has been put to rest by a recent California Supreme Court Decision, decided after our briefs were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.583" offset="3857681">Throughout this case, it is always been argued by the respondents and the inmates that because of California’s indeterminate sentence law, their situation is distinguished from Nebraska’s good time credit sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.339" offset="3904702">The distinction being, of course, in California where the Judge only sentenced the defendant to the term prescribed by law and our Parole Board sets both the maximum sentence and the Parole released date.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.627" offset="3945871">They have argued that because a single disciplinary infraction of a major nature could be basis for the Parole Board's authority to extend their sentence to the maximum, which in many cases as life that it distinguishes them from the good time credit cases such as Nebraska where the man has a fixed sentence and he works it of on good time credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.337" offset="4024656">Since the briefs were filed, the California Supreme Court has considerably modified the indeterminate sentence law and its current application, I submit renders the purported distinction, one without a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.110" offset="4079722">In a case entitled in Ray, Rodriguez reported at volume 122 of the California reporter at 552, the California Supreme Court required our Adult Authority of parole board to set a maximum sentence for every inmate based on the culpability of the individual offender as reflected in the circumstances at the time of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.025" offset="4179405">That sentence can no longer be raised, that term can no longer be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.946" offset="4199050">It can be reduced, but it can never be increased back to the statutory maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.027" offset="4223396">Now, the complaint -- the plaintiffs when they filed initial complaint, argued that the imposition of the discipline in a case would automatically or could possibly result in the extension of their sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.581" offset="4317645">The Court of Appeals held the effect to be too nebulous to require them to proceed in habeas corpus and exhaust their state remedies, but did in fact hold that the notation of a single disciplinary could be so detrimental to their interest and liberty through release on parole, that the entire range of due process was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.307" offset="4392565">I summit that following the Rodriguez modification that you can no longer distinguish the California, the effect of the California in determining sentence law from a good time credit situation and that there is no basis on that ground to distinguish this case from Wolff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.467" offset="4445227">In fact, I remember in Wolff there was one particular inmate whose good time head up to I think 17 months, good time credit removed as a result of a disciplinary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.250" offset="4488277">In California, that was an automatic extension to sentence, 17 months, in California the most that could occur would be a denial of release on parole as maximum sentence could no longer be increased and traditionally the denial of Parole is always been reviewed on a 12 month series.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.879" offset="4550867">So we submit that since our California indeterminate sentence law has been modified, in effect, our procedure is better than Nebraska's on that situation, in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.855" offset="4590782">It cannot be distinguished and we stand on a better footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.632" offset="4637802">The main issue of course is whether a counsel is required at these hearings?</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.640" offset="4665910">The Ninth Circuit held that in their modification of opinion following Wolff, that Wolff did not require it, but your decision in Miranda required it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.958" offset="4703108">I know this has been argued before and I have to repeat it that Prison Disciplinary Proceedings is conducted in California under the procedures outlined in Wolff are not analogous to the Police Station interrogation that brought forth the Miranda rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.650" offset="4781894">There is simply no custody in the California disciplinary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.784" offset="4798403">The rules provide that the inmate will be present, however, no physical force will be used to bring him to the hearing if he does not wish to attend and he may leave if and when he desires.</text>

            <text syncTime="1796.194" offset="7288081">Now, it is also not the issue in this case, whether the procedures that were used at the time this case was brought, meet constitutional standard because they clearly do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.777" offset="7338445">None of the safeguards that this Court required in the Wolff case were followed in 1970 when this case was brought and of course California does not contend that they were in compliance then.</text>

            <text syncTime="2240.454" offset="9065139">The Adult Authority does not hold its own fact finding hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.716" offset="9082171">It relies on hearing that was conducted in the prison and this is what means that the consequences of what happens to the disciplinary hearing are very serious because as the California Supreme Court has held a single disciplinary infraction is sufficient cause to deny parole or to rescind the parole date which is previously have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.579" offset="9169629">That is why the Supreme Court's case in Rodriguez mentioned by counsel does not make any difference because when they set a tentative parole date, they can then rescind it on the basis of a disciplinary offense and make a man serve a whole lot longer in prison as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.978" offset="9243190">It is the difference between being paroled next month and possibly five years from now when your maximum sentence expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.352" offset="9272761">The indeterminate sentence has particular relevance where the charge against the man is criminal in nature where as in Clutchette’s case he is charged with assault on an officer and that is fairly heavy felony under the California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.070" offset="9327618">In that kind of case, the state has an effective option of how to deal with the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.828" offset="9350605">It can achieve further incarceration, additional incarceration, either by following through in the criminal process or can do the very same thing through the Adult Authority with far less procedural ceremony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.416" offset="9412986">Summarily they can make the man serve far longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.690" offset="9434093">The issue to be tried of course in these disciplinary proceeding is the same issue that would be tried in a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.617" offset="9457812">Did the man or not commit the criminal act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.921" offset="9474948">The courts below properly held that the San Quentin procedure that was used when this case was brought failed to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.149" offset="9511938">This is because the man is faced with incurring a very serious and immediate punishment if he does not speak in his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.351" offset="9552689">He has no adequate alternative means of defense besides speaking for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.577" offset="9577662">At this time in San Quentin, he had no right to call any witnesses, he could not cross examine anybody, he had no counsel, he had no counsel substitute, he was left wholly on his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.150" offset="9627921">The sole means of defending himself was to explain his situation, but how could he do that and also exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege, is that dilemma that the Ninth Circuit addressed itself to and of course the dilemma is doubly difficult for the prisoner because he does not have the advice of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.202" offset="9712140">There is nobody there to advise him on the intricacies of the Fifth Amendment, rather there is any realistic risk of prosecution as a result of this event or whether what he wants to say might tend to incriminate him and it is just not accurate to say that prisoners at San Quentin can routinely consult with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.832" offset="9790612">I have heard of very few San Quentin prisoners who have access to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.395" offset="9808898">As the Court must recognize virtually all of them are indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.886" offset="9822899">The only reason Clutchette had counsel was because he was at this time already under indictment for a felony, an in prison felony in California and that is the only reason he had counsel and could consult with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.255" offset="9880369">So the situation facing the prisoner in these disciplinary hearings is either he has to forfeit his only means of defense, the right to speak in his own behalf or he has to waive the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.071" offset="9935644">This conflicts we submit with the line of cases in this Court most recently Lefkowitz and the earlier cases that say a state cannot penalize the exercise of the Fifth Amendment and cannot coerce people to give incriminating testimony against themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.525" offset="10009414">It does not make any difference that formally, in this case, the prisoner is not being punished for taking the Fifth Amendment and it does not make any difference whether or not there is an inference drawn from his silence because he does not have any other means of defending himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3568.951" offset="14379072">Mr. Turner correctly pointed out the Ninth Circuit did provide us with three options, but in reality they boiled down to just one of counsel I submit, both parties are -- postponement is unacceptable to both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.682" offset="14425988">We have been accused in the Circuit Court and in the District Court of doing under the term classification, but the District Court and the Ninth Circuit said we could not do as discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.368" offset="14464754">We do not want to postpone these things and our plans for all cases other than -- these are involved criminally, we are trying to get this over in 72 hours, that is the way to maintain discipline in state prisons not with postponement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.793" offset="14514491">We postponed these major conditions -- these major cases we have to confine the man under some imposed condition, to restrict his freedom, to move about and we are accused of doing by subversion what we cannot do directly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3621.470" offset="14589201">It seems to me what we were talking about is the traditional theories and notions of voluntariness of confessions which is law, clack letter law, all them, but if the man is compelled to make a statement then some sort of Use Immunity is required, but that is not -- Use immunity is nothing new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.007" offset="14655343">That Use Immunity is the trial court's hearing under Johnson v. Avery on the voluntariness of the statement that was made.</text>
