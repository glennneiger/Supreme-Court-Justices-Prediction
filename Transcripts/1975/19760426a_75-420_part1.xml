            <text syncTime="77.206" offset="412146">The question in this case that is here on a direct appeal to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia is whether on the railroads tell the Interstate Commerce Commission, they need an increase in rates for a particular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.531" offset="481423">The Commission has authority of a (Inaudible) increase to tell the railroads, they have to use the money for the purpose for which they seek it.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.533" offset="513501">More precisely, the issue is whether in this case the railroads' representation that they need a substantial increase in rates in order to accomplish deferred maintenance and delayed capital improvements, justified the Commission when it gave this rate in telling the railroads, they had to use the additional revenues derived from the increase that were authorized for that purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.131" offset="631888">Yes, the three railroads, colloquially the Chessie System, it is the Baltimore and Ohio, the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Western Maryland railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.853" offset="694791">The reason the others are noticeable for their absence is only the Chessie system challenged the action of the Commission in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.981" offset="731258">The other railroads all accepted the Commission’s condition that I would come to, in a moment.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="161.780" offset="750484">Well, they did not have the argument that Chessie says it has either.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.582" offset="765635">Well, they do not have any differed maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.071" offset="775562">I mean, they do not say it to anyone --</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="170.613" offset="785802">No, they do not say, they do, however, a number of them are quite prosperous as well as the Chessie.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.053" offset="811506">That they do not make that argument and indeed it is the thrust of my submission to this Court would be that it was all the railroads, as I will come to them, there was all the railroads that came in and said we have this need for the deferred maintenance.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="188.463" offset="857168">Including the Chessie?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="189.422" stopTime="574.548">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="189.422" offset="861035">Including the Chessie, yes Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.363" offset="868767">Let me come right to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.617" offset="877753">The case began in April of 1974, when virtually all the railroads in this country, with one exception I believe, all of the railroads filed a petition with the Commission saying that they needed a 10% across the board increase in freight rates and among the railroads who submitted this petition was the Chessie.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.137" offset="971898">The Chessie, the three Chessie companies, were explicitly listed in an appendix to this petition as among those on whose behalf it was filed and Chessie's counsel Mr. Rettberg who appears here on their behalf on the brief, was one of those whose name appeared on the cover of this document of the petition and at the conclusion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.561" offset="1061550">So that the Chessie associated itself completely with all of the railroads' submissions with respect to the need for this additional revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.651" offset="1101883">Now, what did the railroads tell the Commission with respect to why they needed the revenue?</text>
            <text syncTime="255.129" offset="1123826">The petition said, “Massive additional expenditures are required for maintenance and capital improvement,” that is at the page 107 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.141" offset="1171892">There is a caption in the petition at page 109 which is called, “The Problems of the Industry,” as described by railroad Chief Executives and Operating Officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.986" offset="1223301">This section contained a number of statements by various officials of the country's railroads, not officials of the Chessie, but a number of important officials, describing the extent and seriousness to the railroads of the problems of the deferred maintenance and delayed capital improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.588" offset="1301668">For example, I just give one or two illustrative statements, but there are a number of them in there, they spoke of -- one railroad spoke of the plant deterioration, decline in car fleet and increase in un-serviceable cars that have resulted from inadequate cash flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.756" offset="1370318">Another spoke of years of inadequate spending on maintenance of facilities in way, another is about insufficient maintenance expenditures in the past, and there was attached to this petition, excerpts from a report that had been made, the so called “Astral Report,” dealing with the financial problems that the nation's railroads were facing.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.641" offset="1457880">And it said that the railroad's current difficulty in needing the needs for service can be traced directly to more than a decade of inadequate earnings which have forced major cutbacks in capital spending and maintenance programs, that is at 177 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.108" offset="1527784">Now, under the Interstate Commerce Act, a tariff such as this that is filed, becomes affective within 30 days, unless the Commission acts to suspend it, which as this Court is aware it can do for up to seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.604" offset="1585776">In this case, the railroads because of a claimed -- their claimed need for emergency revenues as fast as possible, asked the Commission to permit these tariffs to become effective on 10 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.046" offset="1639483">The Commission declined to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.588" offset="1649723">It instituted an investigation into the legality of the increases and suspended the tariffs, but it authorized the carriers to themselves cancel the tariff that had been suspended and to file a new substitute tariff at no higher rates than those provided in the original tariff and now I quote the exact words of the Commission at pages 45A of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement, “subject to the following conditions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="419.153" offset="1779918">Now, I stress the words “subject to the following conditions” because the Chessie's contention here is that the orders the Commission initially issued, requiring these conditions, were not really a condition at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.846" offset="1830700">They were merely a hortatory suggestion by the Commission that it was exhorting the railroads to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.571" offset="1857658">At page 46A of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement, under these conditions listed, paragraph number three states, “Revenues generated by the increases should be expended for capital improvements and deferred maintenance of plant and equipment and the amount needed for increased material and supply cost other than fuel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="464.305" offset="1960581">Then over at the top of page 48A of the appendix, the first sentence in the middle of it, the same thought is repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.793" offset="1990465">“The Commission intends that revenues generated by increases, authorized herein over and above the amounts for increased material and supply cost other than fuel, will be used by the respondents exclusively for reducing deferred maintenance of plant and equipment and delayed capital improvements in order that rail service to the shippers will be improved.”</text>
            <text syncTime="494.520" offset="2081371">Then two sentences down the Commission stated, “The respondent’s failure to apply the increased revenues as heretofore specified, will result in the cancellation of this authorized increases.”</text>
            <text syncTime="507.356" offset="2132780">The Commission made one other significant determination earlier in this order at pages 42A and 43A of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement, beginning on the last line of 42A, the Commission said, “The increase is proposed were, if permitted to become effective, generate additional revenues sufficient to enable the carriers to prevent further deterioration and improved service,” and then it said, “However, if the schedules were permitted to become effective as filed and without conditions designed to promote service improvements, the increases proposed would be unjust and unreasonable and contrary to the dictates of the National Transportation Policies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="549.348" offset="2300695">So it was because of these reasons that the Commission imposed this condition to granting of the increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.249" offset="2328280">The next day, after the Commission entered this order, all the railroads filed the new amended tariff, containing basically with one or two minor exceptions, the increases provided for in the earlier tariff and this new tariff became effective in 15 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.006" offset="2419395">The real question is, is the statutory authority of the Commission to do, what it did, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="584.241" stopTime="615.949">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="584.241" offset="2440293">That is correct, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.843" offset="2446667">We are not suggesting that the railroads are estopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.333" offset="2460669">What we are suggesting is that since, if the Chessie, in fact, did not have any deferred maintenance or delayed capital improvements, at that point it could have refused to accept this increase itself because of these conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.008" offset="2515317">What we are saying is that Chessie fully participated with all the other railroads and that the Commission was justified in these circumstances as I would come to in a moment in imposing this condition upon all of the railroads.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="624.497" offset="2601312">I mean, whether it was justified is a matter of rough justice or is really not the question at all?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="632.334" offset="2632659">That is what -- the only thing the Court of Appeals, District Court decided in this case was that the Commission had no authority to do this.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="638.535" stopTime="639.505">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="638.535" offset="2657423">And that is the only issue here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="639.505" stopTime="655.050">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="639.505" offset="2661394">That is right and we suggest in our a briefs that if the court agrees with us on that, it would be appropriate to remand the case to the District Court to pass upon Chessie’s attacks on the application of this condition to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.628" offset="2713848">It suggests it is in somewhat different position.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="655.050" offset="2723565">Mr. Friedman let me just follow that up for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.070" offset="2739657">Would the case be any different, if all of the railroads except Chessie said, “We want to spend the money on the deferred maintenance” and Chessie from the outset said, “We do not need the money for that purpose, but we think rates are to be uniformed and if you do not give us the increase, that will be a weakening of the rate structure all over the country because you did made that point in your own brief,” would the case be different, if that is the way it had been presented?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="680.035" stopTime="1063.414">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="680.035" offset="2823457">I think it would be Mr. Justice for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.201" offset="2840176">First, if the Chessie had made that submission, the Commission might not have granted the Chessie the increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.200" offset="2864104">It might have decided that in the particular circumstances of this case, it would be appropriate to treat the Chessie different.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.826" offset="2890644">We do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.541" offset="2893466">We do not know, but they might not have done it, but if -- I think, it will be a much more difficult case, if the Chessie said that and the Commission said, “Never mind, we think the rates have to be uniform throughout,” but I think, that would be a more difficult case because let me make something right at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.415" offset="2953025">We make no claim, contrary to what the District Court suggested that the Commission has any general authority, any general authority to tell the railroads how to spend their money, that is is what we think the Commission is doing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.260" offset="3008404">In this case what the Commission did, was it said that to the extent these increased rates exceed, increases in cost which the Commission subsequently said came to 3%, to the extent the increase here exceeded the additional cost, it would be unjust and unreasonable, unless the carriers applied the increases for the purposes for which they said they needed them, and that is to improve service, to improve service by using the funds for correcting their maintenance deficiencies and their defects in capital improvements, that is our basic petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.499" offset="3181335">Now, let me just briefly elude to three other orders that the Commission entered in this case which kind of fill out the details of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.650" offset="3213936">In the subsequent order they defined what they meant by capital deferred maintenance and delayed capital improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.862" offset="3246746">Then they subsequently, in August of 1974, denied a petition for reconsideration by the Chessie which proposed that the order be amended to provide that if any carrier had no deferred maintenance or delayed improvements, it could use the funds for any valid corporate purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.972" offset="3335248">And at page 88 of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement, the Commission explained why?</text>
            <text syncTime="816.042" offset="3367536">It said that it is consistently expressed its full intention that the authorized increases over and above increased costs shall be used by the respondents exclusively for reducing the deferred maintenance of plant and equipment and delayed capital improvements, in order that rail service to the shippers will be improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.409" offset="3444963">It pointed out at pages 81-82 that the petition and the verified statements filed in this case as it said are replete with references to the need for revenues, to provide funds for great, but unspecified amounts of deferred maintenance and capital improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.183" offset="3520091">It also pointed out at page 81A that its decision how to apply the funds which the Commission had required be segregated that the decision on how to apply them to what particular items that deferred maintenance or delayed capital improvements and to determine the extent to which these were necessary, was a decision left to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.641" offset="3601906">The Commission, in other words, is not telling them how to apply it or to what.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.317" offset="3616639">It just tells them they had to apply it, as they said, they were going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.032" offset="3631477">And finally in October when some of the railroads came in and stated that they really could not use these funds for that purpose, the Commission said, “Well, any railroad that cannot apply all of the increase under this order for deferred maintenance or delayed capital improvements, may with the permission of the Commission, expend it for new and additional capital improvements.”</text>
            <text syncTime="908.122" offset="3735862">Under that provision, a number of railroads have been authorized by the Commission to expend the funds generated by this increase to new capital improvements where they convinced the Commission that they had no deferred or delayed maintenance or capital improvements and all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.190" offset="3808065">I think, it is somewhat significant that although Chessie keeps telling us now that it has no deferred maintenance or delayed capital improvements, it has never sought the permission or authorization of the Commission to expend the funds challenged under this order which is known in railroad jargon as Ex Parte 305.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.837" offset="3902628">The Three-Judge District Court, in setting aside the Commission's order, said two things before it came to its actual decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.989" offset="3943275">It said first of all that it had no doubt that Chessie’s facilities require additional maintenance and improvement, that is at page 15A of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.702" offset="3990086">It pointed out that over a 10-year period from 1964-1973, the number of annual derailments of these carriers had increased to a 176% from 87-240.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.223" offset="4052257">The court also described the Commission’s action and I quote again from page 22A as, “A well intentioned effort to cope with the vexatious deterioration of track and equipment that saps the ability of the nation's railroads to serve the public adequately.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.902" offset="4122892">However, relying on decisions of this Court, two old decisions, which it saw as establishing the proposition that the Commission has no general power to control the railroad's expenditures, it said that the Congress had not authorized the Commission to control the carrier's expenditure of funds as a condition to withholding the suspension of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.936" offset="4211082">Now, as I have said previously, we think the District Court misunderstood in the case and approached it incorrectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.121" offset="4239817">The Commission is not attempting here to tell the railroads how could they ought to expend their funds, generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.191" offset="4268133">All it is saying to the railroads is that when they told the Commission that they need additional funds for a particular purpose in order to provide adequate service, the Commission can say to them, “Yes, if that is what you need the funds for, you may have those funds, provided you do with them what you have told us you intend to do it with them.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.711" offset="4462171">That there are some evidence in the record at page 54A, a dissenting opinion of Commissioner O’Neil at one stage of the proceedings, in which, he points out that in the past, the Commission had given a large number of increases to the carriers and that although they admonished the carriers to use this money to improve their service, the carriers had not done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.058" offset="4559555">In addition to that, we have in this case, protests by shippers in which they said that there have been a lot of these increases and the railroads were always making these promises, you should protect the shippers by doing something to make sure that the railroads carry out their commitments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.471" offset="4633221">I refer to pages 213 of the appendix where the National Industrial Traffic League, probably the leading organization of shippers in this country, urged the Commission to that and also at 215 and 221, where two large shippers made this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.692" offset="4826109">The National Transportation Policy which is a prelude or preface to the statute itself and was created and enacted in 1940, directs that all provisions of the Act be administered with a view to carrying out that policy and one element of that policy listed is the promotion and preservation of safe, adequate and efficient service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.575" offset="4929658">Now, it seems to us that an essential and important element of safe, adequate, and efficient service is to ensure that the carriers do provide adequate maintenance of their plant and equipment and to make the necessary capital investments in order to haul the shipper's goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.680" offset="5018057">We find this authority of the Commission to impose this Commission in the broad contours of Section 15a (2) of the Act, which directs the Commission in exercising its power to prescribe just and reasonable rates to consider the need in the public interest of adequate and efficient railway transportation service at the lowest cost consistent with the furnishing of that service.</text>
