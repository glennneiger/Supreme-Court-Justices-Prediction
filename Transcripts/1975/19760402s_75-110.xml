            <text syncTime="14.528" offset="131766">The District Court for the Western District of Texas held invalid a patent entitled Dairy Establishment, holding that the patent does not constitute invention, is not patentable, is not a valid patent, it being a combination patent, all of the elements of which are old and the combination of them is described being either new nor meeting the test of non-obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.080" offset="249944">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and ordered that a Judgment be entered, holding the patent valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.820" offset="284948">We agree with the District Court and disagree with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.048" offset="301771">We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for reasons stated in the opinion filed with the clerk.</text>
