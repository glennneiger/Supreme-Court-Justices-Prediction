            <label>Mr. Randolph</label>
            <text syncTime="43.876" offset="278823">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.852" offset="290735">This case is hereon writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.467" offset="309230">The issue is one of statutory interpretation and we believe one of considerable importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.618" offset="333785">The question is whether nuclear materials, nuclear waste materials that are already comprehensively controlled and regulated by the success or agencies to the Autonomic Energy Commission are pollutants within the meaning of the Federal Order Pollution Control Act as amended in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.169" offset="419989">If they are pollutants, the result is that these same nuclear materials will be under the regulatory control of the Environmental Protection Agency and if one accepts the arguments of the Fourteen States who are here in amicus curiae eventually under the control of the individual states.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.642" offset="501909">The case arises as a result of a suit that was brought in October of 1973 in the District Court of Colorado by two organizations representing College students and law students attending school in Colorado and also for individual citizens of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.300" offset="576515">The respondents who are plaintiffs below saw that the declaratory judgment in an injunction against the EPA and its administrator for failing to regulate the particular material, nuclear material that is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.339" offset="628655">They pointed to the fact that they were two nuclear facilities within the State of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.277" offset="656449">One was the Fort St. Vrain Generating Power Station which is a nuclear reactor gas-cooled that had, at that time not been yet in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.425" offset="709008">And the other was the Rocky Flats Plant which is a plant that fabricates plutonium for use in weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.696" offset="746102">It is owned by the Federal Government specifically, the Energy Research and Development Administration and run by a private company.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.485" offset="785285">The record here is very, very sparse.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.577" offset="793645">This case was decided on cross motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.517" offset="813393">Actually, it could have been judgment on the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.029" offset="823424">There were only two things outside the record both of which are in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.199" offset="836172">There were only two exhibits in regard to draft permits for the Fort St. Vrain Generating Station.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.665" offset="873997">The District Court granted the Environmental Protection Agencies Motion for summary judgment and this was at the pleading stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.369" offset="908792">The Court of Appeals reversed holding that the EPA had the responsibility and duty of regulating the material in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.175" offset="944005">Before I proceed to the argument, I think some statutory background is necessary in light of this very sparse record.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.177" offset="972009">The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 conferred upon the Atomic Energy Commission which is now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and ERDA complete, extensive, exclusive authority and control over the use and disposal of certain nuclear materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.667" offset="1042017">These materials fall into three categories of substances which was set forth in the footnotes on our brief at page 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.889" offset="1074931">First of all source material.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.515" offset="1077439">Source material means materials such as Uranium 238 from which nuclear fuel was extracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.338" offset="1112652">The second kind of material that is involved here is special nuclear material such as fissionable material.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.683" offset="1138043">It is Uranium 233, Uranium 235 and plutonium.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.982" offset="1159254">The third kind of material in addition to source and special nuclear material is byproduct material.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.545" offset="1185481">That means the material that is produced from the fission process itself and made radioactive as a result of that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.228" offset="1224247">The nuclear regulatory commission has established maximum permissible limits on the releases of radioactivity into the environment by its licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.463" offset="1269178">Its licenses further limit to a minute percentage of those maximum limits the amount that an individual licensee like the Fort St. Vrain Generating Station can release into the atmosphere either through the air or through the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.870" offset="1342843">And of course the Court is familiar with the licensing procedures that the NRC conducts are detailed comprehensive and a great deal of time, manpower spent before a plant, a nuclear generating plan can even be constructed, let alone operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.028" offset="1415463">After it does get constructed, there is another licensing procedure and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.003" offset="1431346">That essentially in a nutshell is what the Atomic Energy Act does.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.568" offset="1457573">The Water Act which was amended in 1972 and in several important respects, has as its basics structure in regard to discharges of pollutants into the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.270" offset="1512430">One section that absolutely forbids any discharges of any pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States without a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.877" offset="1550882">The permit can be issued by EPA as it would have been the case in Colorado in 1973, when this case was started or if a state has adopted pursuant to EPA’s approval, a plan for implementing a permit program then the authority to issue permits is transferred from EPA to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.382" offset="1636877">Colorado adapted and approved plan as of April 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.399" offset="1664881">It did not have one when this case was began.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.324" offset="1680658">So the first point under the Water Act is that no discharge of pollutant without a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.556" offset="1705527">The term pollutant is defined in Section 5026 of the Water Act to include radioactive materials and I put quotations around that phrase, “Radioactive Materials.”</text>
            <text syncTime="414.353" offset="1760698">This leads to Respondents argument which is essentially set forth in their complaint and as the argument that was adapted by the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.540" offset="1797478">The argument is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.243" offset="1804270">Source, special nuclear, byproduct materials under the Atomic Energy Act are radioactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.169" offset="1831960">No question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.464" offset="1849201">I am not sure about that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="439.472" stopTime="441.332">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="439.472" offset="1861217">Rather radioactive?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randolph" startTime="441.332" stopTime="978.437">
            <label>Mr. Randolph</label>
            <text syncTime="441.332" offset="1868636">There are other ways of producing radioactive material and I am a not scientific expert enough to know what is more or less radioactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.111" offset="1895803">There is accelerator processes which are not regulated by the Atomic Energy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.220" offset="1916178">But they are radioactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.278" offset="1920463">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.937" offset="1927045">Therefore there are pollutants under the Water Act, therefore they cannot be discharge without a permit at the time from EPA now either from EPA or the State of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.740" offset="1970304">Therefore EPA must regulate the discharge of the source or special nuclear and byproduct material.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.956" offset="1999143">EPA refused to do that and what probably precipitated this suit is the regulation of EPA which is set forth of page 18 of our brief which was adapted in the summer of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.261" offset="2072391">In implementing the Water Act, EPA repeated the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.281" offset="2096423">The term pollutant means radioactive materials discharged into the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.799" offset="2118575">However, in a comment, the administrator of EPA stated that the legislative history of the Water Act reflects that the term radioactive materials is included in the definition of pollutant covers, only radioactive materials which are not encompassed in the definition of source byproduct or special nuclear materials and so forth, as covered by the Atomic Energy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.317" offset="2220557">This legislative history which is set forth in detail in our brief and also in the amicus brief of the utilities here, which the administrator relied upon which respondents urges Court not to look at and which the Court below indicated could be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.188" offset="2284087">we think demonstrates conclusively the correctness of EPA’s interpretation of this particular provision in the Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.004" offset="2315329">Before discussing that history however, I would like to discuss and stress a few points that we think are important in approaching this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.856" offset="2350752">First of all, that of course on this record, there is no evidence whatsoever and in fact respondents complaint is not even alleged that the successor agencies to the Atomic Energy Commission are in any way improperly failing to perform their duty in regard to the discharge of nuclear material on question.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.747" offset="2434343">They do not claim that the minute amount now released could in any way be reduced and indeed there is no allegation that there is even the remotest danger to the health or the environment under the current situation of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.948" offset="2491081">There is nothing indeed in the hearings and the extensive hearings that took place before the Water Act was amended in 1972 but indicates anything in regard to any problem whatsoever from the discharged into the water from nuclear power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.008" offset="2555343">As a matter of fact, the only statement that is relevant to that question is quoted at the top of the page 43 of the brief, amicus curiae by the utilities and that statement is from the testimony of Russell Train who was now of course the administrator of EPA and then was Chairman of the Counsel on Environmental Quality and he testified that the existing Atomic Energy Commission Regulation of discharges such as what we are talking about from Nuclear Plants was rigorous and demanded adherence to “the highest possible standards.”</text>
            <text syncTime="652.102" offset="2711764">What we are talking about here in light of the Atomic Energy or the successors to the Atomic Energy Commissions Regulations are discharges from Nuclear Power Plants into water and into the air that specifically in regard to the water cannot exceed 5 millirems per person per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.360" offset="2788773">It has to be less than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.322" offset="2792639">A rem is a radioactive dose.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.473" offset="2805178">I think the average person of the United States receives a dose of 500 rems.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.084" offset="2823672">But to give the Court an idea of what 5 millirems means, it means simply this, that if you stood outside of a nuclear power plant that was license and as they have to be by the NRC and took your drinking water, from the water that is discharged in that power plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.176" offset="2892009">For an entire year, you could not receive a dose of more than 5 millirems which is equal to or less than the radioactivity that you would receive from flying from Washington DC to Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.976" offset="2959196">Secondly, in establishing the liquid effluent limitations for Nuclear Power Plants, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must consider the design and operation of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.208" offset="3008201">What comes out is intermittently related with how the plant is operated and how it is designed reducing the radioactivity discharged into the water could as we stated in our brief result in serious problems in regard to increased gas emissions or solid waste emissions and indeed even safety problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.172" offset="3088032">And let me give the Court an example of what we mean by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.635" offset="3105899">The way that these minute fractions of radioactivity get released at all is through an osmosis process.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.872" offset="3134843">There are rods that are submitted and stuck into the core of a nuclear reactor.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.337" offset="3152711">They contain the radioactive material.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.063" offset="3163578">They are made generally of stainless steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.843" offset="3174654">Water within a loop, this is water that is self-contained circulates around those rods as a cooling process.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.452" offset="3201089">Other water flows through to cool that water in the loop.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.809" offset="3214569">That is the water that generally is pumped out at the end of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.611" offset="3233795">The reason any radioactivity gets out at all is because of a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.717" offset="3250200">Number one there may be microscopic faults in that stainless steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.653" offset="3269948">There is an osmosis process where there is a transfers, so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.627" offset="3289801">There is one way that you do not have to be a scientist to understand of stopping that from happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.531" offset="3309445">And that is to increase the thickness of the stainless steel rods.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.436" offset="3325119">Increase that, the osmosis stops, the faults disappear because of the thickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.450" offset="3345181">Unfortunately, what that would do is require one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.433" offset="3361063">It will require the nuclear generating plant that operate at a higher temperature.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.006" offset="3379349">And second of all, it would take more time for that plant to cool down.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.018" offset="3399411">If God forbid, there ever were an accident in which the coolant for some reason or another was not working properly and as the scientific material that is cited in all these briefs indicates the most dangerous problem in operating a nuclear power plant is loss of coolant because that is when a problem can occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.440" offset="3477047">Of course, the NRC follows a rule three generally for every system that is needed, they have three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.300" offset="3500557">Everything is bolted on to a power plant, now that can prevent the discharge of radioactivity is now bolted on.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.925" offset="3526993">But that gives, I think the Court an idea that what we are talking about here is not simply putting something on the end of a pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.174" offset="3552071">The filtered out radioactive waste material.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.685" offset="3566072">The Congress itself recognized the interrelationships that I am talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.498" offset="3585298">In the Atomic Energy Act itself, Congress specifically stated that the NRC was forbidden in any way to relinquish its authority in regulatory control over the material we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.058" offset="3631587">Now, with all this in mind and with the fact that we have the Atomic Energy Act on the books now for nearly 20 years at the time of the Water Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.159" offset="3660009">We think it would be remarkable indeed if Congress directed the EPA to regulate the same nuclear materials for the same purposes that they are being regulated now by the NRC and that it is precisely the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.241" offset="3716329">The House Committee Report which is cited on page 38 of our brief, we think demonstrates that Congress intended no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.448" offset="3757080">Report says that the term pollutant is defined in this bill includes radioactive materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.286" offset="3784456">But these materials are not those encompassed in the definition of source, byproduct or special nuclear materials as defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.278" offset="3836492">The material or the Congress wanted EPA to regulate was the material that was beyond the jurisdiction of what was then the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.817" offset="3874631">And this was not a statement and a report that was buried away and forgotten, written but not read by the people that were most concerned with this legislation because this statement in the house report was specifically cited and relied upon and later floor debates and specifically in order to defeat an amendment submitted by Congressman Wolfe that would have had the effect submitted on the House Floor that would have had the effect of allowing the States to be able to regulate radioactive discharges from nuclear power plants.</text>

            <label>Mr. Randolph</label>
            <text syncTime="991.927" offset="4071072">They are not absolutely inconsistent but I think it is inconceivable that if Congress on the one hand writes a statute and then directs and the report that they are only doing with materials that are not regulated AEC that they would want the EPA to regulate that material too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.690" offset="4142125">And it is also inconceivable I think that in light of the lack of any consideration of what a regulatory scheme would result from two regulations by an agency that on the one hand could only regulate how much comes out and an agency on the other hand that regulates not only that but the design, the operation, the licensing function with no consideration or whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.919" offset="4235016">I think that the potential for inconsistent regulations would certainly be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.978" offset="4259258">And it is a potential that we think would be dangerous for the reasons we stated and we also think the Congress gave absolutely no consideration to whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.970" offset="4303248">And indeed the Wolfe Amendment that I was about to discuss Mr. Justice Rehnquist, one of the basis on which that was opposed is that in this act, we are not dealing with the material that is regulated by the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.631" offset="4357896">And therefore we are not going to give it to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.581" offset="4369703">A number of Congressmen said if we want to deal with that question, let us amend the Atomic Energy Act directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.748" offset="4394363">Not do it collaterally in which case the legislation should go through the relevant committee, the joint committee on Atomic Energy which handles these particular matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.243" offset="4432293">The Congressman that spoke up against that amendment were not only Congressman who were members of the joint committee on atomic energy but also members of the public works committee that reported out this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.153" offset="4479940">And the amendment that I was speaking of, the Wolfe amendment that was defeated by a three to one margin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.524" offset="4509406">On the Senate side, Senator Pastore who was then chairman of the joint committee on Atomic Energy sought assurances from Senator Muskie who sponsored the bill on the Senate side, that this legislation that they were then considering would in no way affect the regulatory responsibility and control under the Atomic Energy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.121" offset="4599790">There is no question whatsoever that if the Environmental Protection Agency is given regulatory authority over the same materials that that will have an effect on the responsibility and authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, on hopes it would not be inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.933" offset="4663111">But it nevertheless would have an effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.319" offset="4672619">I think Respondents have sought to and the States also have sought to try to work out some system that would operate when you have this redundant regulatory control for the same purposes of the same material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.783" offset="4722461">Someone has to give way some place and there is no question as I said that that would really be inconsistent with Senator Muskie’s assurances to Senator Pastore that the bill that had in front of them would not have any effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.742" offset="4774288">When the Conference Committee reported out this bill, two members of the Conference Committee who were in the House of Representatives again assured that the radioactive materials did not include the Atomic Energy Act regulated nuclear materials, confirming the understanding of the representative who asked the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.437" offset="4861119">We think it is important to remember here that we are dealing with the statute that is directed not regulating the activities of the general public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1202.100" offset="4911692">The administrator of the of the Environmental Protection Agency, telling him what to regulate and he is a person that Congress I think can in fact trust to know precisely what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.844" offset="4962683">EPA Administrator was testifying at the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.098" offset="4971774">He was in active participation with this legislation as it was going through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.920" offset="4994970">And I would like to read from what Senator Muskie said on the Senate Floor and this is not quoted in any of the brief so I give the Court the citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.027" offset="5039483">It is on the second volume of the compiled legislative history on pages 1347 to 1348.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.265" offset="5076368">It has got nothing to do with radioactive material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.554" offset="5089534">But what he is talking about is what the administrator’s responsibility is in defining and in dealing with the very section we are discussing here, the section defining a pollutant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.939" offset="5131121">And Senator Muskie says, I do not want to get into the business of defining or applying these definitions to particular kinds of pollutants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.574" offset="5165602">That is an administrative decision to be made by the administrator, sometimes a particular kind of matter is a pollutant in one circumstance and not in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.044" offset="5199561">That is a decision to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.308" offset="5204577">I am very reluctant to try to make it on the Floor of the senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.413" offset="5240939">So we get back to what a pollutant is under a particular set of circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.797" offset="5266539">The administrator can do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.739" offset="5274272">I would like to that to be helpful to my colleague but we are going to have to live it to the judgment of the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.821" offset="5298618">And that is precisely what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.717" offset="5306245">It was left to the judgment of the administrator and he interpreted the legislative history which we think is convincing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.154" offset="5331950">Before I leave that, I would like to mention one other thing which we think is relevant, hardly convincing but when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and ERDA were formed by the re-organization Act of 1974, an amendment was proposed in the house that would have had the effect of redefining radioactive materials as used in this act to mean materials including those now regulated under the Atomic Energy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.790" offset="5458487">The amendment was rejected by voice vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.066" offset="5475623">The citations were set up at page 49 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.617" offset="8161847">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.375" offset="8176789">The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is a systematic and comprehensive regulatory scheme designed to restore and maintain our nation’s vital water resources, every industrial category and indeed every energy facility in this country is subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and at the present time, every nuclear facility including those subject to regulation on the Atomic Energy Act must obtain a permit pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.216" offset="8312208">What Petitioner seeks is to exclude AEA regulated materials that is radioactive materials subject to the Atomic Energy Act from the existing permits that nuclear facilities must obtain pursuant to the Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.629" offset="8377827">I would like to make three points this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.016" offset="8387441">The first is that the objectives and purposes of the Water Act as well as the expressed statutory language clearly mandate that all radioactive materials must be regulated pursuant to that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.647" offset="8441880">Second, that when the legislative history of the act is considered fully and in context, it clearly indicates that Congress intended that all radioactive materials be regulated pursuant to the Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.837" offset="8502693">And third, that the pre-emption involved in the Northern States Power decision has no bearing on issues which are presented for review today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.360" offset="8544802">The strategy of the Water Act was to create specific limits on the amount of pollutants that could be discharged into our nation’s water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.931" offset="8587016">To this end, the Act gives the EPA, the sole responsibility to set effluent limitations and specifically states that other Federal permitting and licensing agencies must accept the EPA limitations and cannot set any of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.863" offset="8666742">The Water Act specifically defines several terms which indicate that it was the intent of Congress to regulate all radioactive materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.710" offset="8706134">Thus the Act specifically defines pollutant to include radioactive materials without limitation or exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.374" offset="8740825">Further, the Act defines pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.926" offset="8755036">Pollution includes and this is very important, the man-made or man-induced alteration of the radiological integrity of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.411" offset="8801011">Third, the Act prohibits the discharge of high level radioactive waste and radiological warfare agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.764" offset="8834343">Both of these materials are exclusively regulated by the Atomic Energy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.787" offset="8858481">And fourth, the Act states that nuclear steam-electric generating plants are subject to its regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.125" offset="8891813">Fifth, the Act regulates toxic pollutants and hazardous materials and indeed is undisputed that as these terms are used in the Water Act, radioactive materials would be toxic pollutants and hazardous materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.824" offset="8970598">The definition of pollutant and pollution are central to the Water Act for as these terms determine the scope of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.744" offset="9022321">Congress recognized the importance of these terms Representative Blatnik (ph) a member of the FWPCA’s Conference Committee made the point succinctly, the total utility of the Bill is reflected in the definition of the term pollutant, pollution, point-source, discharge and toxic pollutant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.607" offset="9105808">To revise any of these definitions is to upset the common thread of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.056" offset="9127542">If there is a part of this bill that can be labeled most important is these definitions to revise them in a way to limit their coverage is to severely detract from the effectiveness of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.587" offset="9181667">Moreover, these critical definitions as well as the rest of the Act received microscopic scrutiny from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.125" offset="9215836">The final bill was subject to a three-month conference in which the Conference Committee met 39 times and according to Senator Muskie, the Conference Committee tried to write into expressed language as clearly as possible, the intent of Congress and not leave final evaluation of the bill to legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.056" offset="9299532">Thus, the definition of pollutant includes radioactive materials without exception or limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.993" offset="9335267">The natural meaning of this term in both its popular usage and in a technical sense has always meant all radioactive materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.337" offset="9368704">Indeed, the NRCs own regulations define radioactive materials as any such material whether or not subject to licensing controlled by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.856" offset="9414784">This is found in 10 CFR Section 20.3 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.884" offset="9438921">Furthermore, the definition of pollutant contains specific exceptions from the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.757" offset="9466402">This Court has reaffirmed on numerous occasions that when a statutory phrase contains specific limitations or exceptions, no further exceptions are to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.644" offset="9517916">Moreover, the exemption which the government is seeking in this Court would render the FWPCA’s reference to radioactive materials virtually meaningless for the vast majority of radioactive materials are discharged into water are subject to the Atomic Energy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.620" offset="9585834">Nothing is left by comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.129" offset="9615823">It should also be noted that whenever Congress has utilized a term, radioactive materials, and other legislation, what it has intended to include all radioactive materials, it has just utilize the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.666" offset="9665978">When it has intended to exclude those subject to the Atomic Energy Act, it has said so in expressed language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.207" offset="9704116">The intent of Congress to include all radioactive materials within the Water Act is further found in the definition of pollutant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.827" offset="9734627">The Act defines pollution as a man-made or man-induced alteration of the radiological integrity of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.004" offset="9767333">Radioactive materials regulate under the Atomic Energy Act are all man-made or man-induced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.026" offset="9795441">Therefore, this was the precise type of pollution which Congress had in mind when it defined pollution to mean man-made or man-induced alteration of the radiological integrity of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.857" offset="9850716">Since radioactive materials subject to the Atomic Energy Act constitute the vast majority of radioactive materials discharged into water, the exclusion would render meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.088" offset="9899721">The Congressional intent to protect the radiological integrity of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.304" offset="9920515">In summary, the language of the Act reflects a consistent intent on the part of Congress to regulate all radioactive materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.589" offset="9961684">Under the circumstances of this case, we submit that resort to legislative history is unnecessary and unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.932" offset="9991045">However, since the government places such heavy reliance on it, we will present the legislative history in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.941" offset="10031065">The government utilizes the legislative history in the case of Bar to create not to solve ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.379" offset="10076832">It is our position that both the Senate Bill and the Conference Committee plainly intended to include all radioactive materials while the exemption which the government seeks in this Court had some support in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.720" offset="10138167">It never obtained the status of legislative language and was specifically rejected by the Conference Committee.</text>
