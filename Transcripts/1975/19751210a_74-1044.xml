            <text syncTime="36.602" offset="251059">This is an appeal from the order of a Three-Judge District Court enjoining the enforce in the Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 32, Section 26, sub-section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.382" offset="290138">That statute requires that members of the Uniformed Branch of the Massachusetts State Police retire upon reaching the age of 50 or on serving 20 years which ever occurs later.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.033" offset="336741">The action was initiated by the plaintiff, a member of the Uniformed Branch, shortly after he was notified by the Board in May of 1972 that he would be retired on his 50th birthday.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.950" offset="384388">The complaint filed in the Federal District Court essentially alleged that this statute denied him equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.497" offset="410615">The District Judge who initially heard the case dismissed the case for failure to raise a substantial federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.860" offset="436006">The District Judge recognized the interest of the Commonwealth insuring a high level of physical capability of uniformed officers of the State Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.058" offset="468816">The Court rules that retirement at age 50 was at least irrational if not the only means of achieving these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.737" offset="499536">Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals which court remanded for the convening of the Three-Judge District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.366" offset="982070">The Court also noted that the Board of Retirement had not proved that a critical area was reached at age 50 which would justify disregarding these examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.877" offset="1020104">The issue brought to this Court is whether mandatory retirement of members of the Uniformed Branch of the Massachusetts State Police contravenes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.284" offset="4005796">So the only way that you get to reach your 50th year is to continue to be fit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.926" offset="4412365">One, it showed that some of the group, at least some of the group, were not being fit, we would just not be able to meet standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.171" offset="4449250">That is not -- in any given year the number who would come back were significantly less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.778" offset="4471716">Secondly, the District Court suggest that perhaps the issue of predictive validity is another reason to retire a man, that perhaps at age 50 or 51, even though a man passes a physical examination, it is no assurance that he is going to continue to be fit for the next year until he is examined again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.885" offset="4540156">The evidence show that as in the case of airline pilots, the predictive validity of physical examinations is extensive and elaborate, and this one really only begins to break down at around the age of 60.</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.489" offset="8098556">I think the legislative package here clearly shows that the -- what we are talking about here is a particular sub-classification and the statute in its first one or two sections sets out the general terms, establishes these three general classifications, then we are going to get all the way back to Section 26, we find the specific sub-classification which is limited just to members of the Uniformed Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.782" offset="8207748">So I think we are not talking about four classifications here, we are really talking about three classifications, and then a sub-classification of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.086" offset="8240976">And I would submit that if the rationale of supplying retirement benefits is a justification for taking this sub-classification out and treating these members essentially different from many others, then retirement statutes, in general, will simply be a subterfuge for the State to practice age discrimination.</text>
