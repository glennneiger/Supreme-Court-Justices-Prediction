            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73684">In the second case, McDonald against the Santa Fe Trail Transportation Company is from the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.517" offset="103673">Petitioners in this case, two white employees of the Santa Fe Trail Transportation Company were fired after being charged with involvement in the theft of property entrusted to the company, but a similarly charged Negro employee was not fired, alleging that their firing was racially motivated and that the union acquiesced in the racially discriminating firing, petitioners brought this action in the Southern District of Texas under Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 64 and 42 United States Code, Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.205" offset="250481">The District Court dismissed the case on the pleadings, holding that 1981 does not protect white persons from racial discrimination in private employment and that petitioners have failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.664" offset="312339">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.306" offset="322892">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we hold first, that Title 7 prohibits racial discrimination in private employment against white persons as well as non-whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.771" offset="364688">And that the facts alleged by petitioner were adequate under McDonald Douglas Corporation against Green, to state a claim of such racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.904" offset="405230">Crime or other misconduct against an employer may be legitimate basis for discharge but it cannot be used as a pretext for racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.766" offset="444727">Secondly we hold that 1981 also applies to racial discrimination in private employment against white persons as well as non-whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.454" offset="483493">We find this conclusion be required not only by the language of the statute, but also by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.625" offset="512123">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.438" offset="547336">Mr. Justice White has filed a concurring statement, concurring in part in statement and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.306" offset="578892">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a similar statement concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
