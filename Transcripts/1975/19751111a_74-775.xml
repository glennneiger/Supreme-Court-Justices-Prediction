            <text syncTime="64.203" offset="360089">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.085" offset="375658">The first issue presented by this matter is one of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.512" offset="397392">We are here before this Court today under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1254 Subparagraph 2, which comes from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.593" offset="441696">The original case being heard by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana on an attack upon one of our city ordinances regulating street vendors and hawkers in the historical district known as the Vieux Carre or French Quarters of the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.748" offset="506271">That particular ordinance holds and provides that holders or permits not valid for eight previous years may not receive or apply for and get another permit for the coming year, what we would commonly call a grandfather clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.982" offset="571263">The District Court on cross motions for summary judgment held in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.379" offset="592788">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, after placing us on their summary calendar, reversed holding that the ordinance?s grandfather clause was unconstitutional as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.130" offset="643779">We filed a direct appeal to this Court under 1254-2.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.786" offset="666454">Now under 1254-2, a municipal ordinance that is well established by this time, it can be considered as a statute because 1254-2 merely provides for direct appeal from a Court of Appeals judgment, which holds a state statute invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.420" offset="728938">The jurisprudence over the years has established one other requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.229" offset="748269">This requirement being that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be a final judgment, and what is ?final? has indeed been an elusive question down through the jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.581" offset="793618">Most recently, after my brief was filed, this Court in Doran versus Salem Inn, Inc.did recognize the fact that this question is indeed a hard question.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.104" offset="839698">All of the cases that I have been able to find mainly Cox, MTM versus Baxley, North Dakota Board versus Snyder Drugs, and Miami Herald versus Tornillo seem to distill it down to one question, if the Court of Appeals does finally determine the constitutional question before it, and therefore, the question will not survive the remand and the remand has no material effect on the federal constitutional issue, then for purposes of 1254-2, direct appeal to this Honorable Court that is a final judgment.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="221.296" offset="988491">Mr. Loeffelholz, will all that really is involved on this jurisdictional place whether you should come here by appeal or by certiorari?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joel_p_loeffelholz" startTime="230.007" stopTime="399.486">
            <label>Mr. Joel P. Loeffelholz</label>
            <text syncTime="230.007" offset="1023286">That is correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and we would also submit that the City of El Paso case would allow you to treat this matter as a matter on certiorari as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.118" offset="1063828">But at any rate, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion did finally determine that the grandfather clause is unconstitutional as it appears in that particular city ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.710" offset="1098101">The only thing left for the District Court to decide is whether that particular provision of the city ordinance is severable from the ordinance?s general preclusion of hotdog pushcart vendors in the French Quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.748" offset="1146271">There can be no question that the ordinance does create some form of statutory discrimination that is well established and conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.468" offset="1173229">However, not all statutory discriminations are violative of the Fourteenth Amendment as this Court has taught in many, many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.212" offset="1212204">States are afforded wide latitude in the area of regulation of their streets under their police power, and presumption of validity must be presumed at the time of the legislative enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.987" offset="1271240">To be unconstitutional, there must be some form of invidious discrimination based upon some totally arbitrary ground which bears no rational relation to the legitimate government and sought by the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.811" offset="1326516">The case that the Fifth Circuit relied upon heavily in its decision was Morey versus Doud, and Morey versus Doud which was in 1957 sometime ago set forth four distinct requirements to be looked into before a statute is held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.386" offset="1408854">It starts out by stating a proposition that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not take from the state the power to classify in the adaption of police laws, but admits of the exercise of a wide scope of discretion in that regard and avoids what is done only when it was without any reasonable basis and, therefore, arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.212" offset="1488161">The second criteria established by Morey is that the classification, having some reasonable basis, does not offend against the Fourteenth Amendment merely because it is not made with some mathematical nicety or because, in practice, it results in some form of inequality.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.494" offset="1553258">The third criteria is that when the classification in such law is called in question, if any state of facts, and this is important, can reasonably be conceived that would sustain it, the existence of that state effects at the time the law was enacted must be assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.188" offset="1620027">The legislative body -- we are talking about judicial restraint at this point, the legislative bodies which is the embodiment of the whole entire City of New Orleans, the Council?s judgment must be presumed to have been valid at the time that the ordinance was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.737" offset="1690245">So, what we come down to actually --</text>

            <text syncTime="440.987" offset="1867250">Well, I feel that as far as the law is concerned it may have application in the area of the equal protection argument, and I feel that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal rightly so looked at those requirements as expressed in Morey versus Doud, but their interpretation of it strongly differs from ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.206" offset="1940080">What we must do, therefore, in the area of equal protection arguments is weigh the society?s interests, and the society is you and we and everyone else, against the particular individual?s interest to see if the societal interest is compelling, and this is important again and, therefore, predominant over the individual?s rights and privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.613" offset="2017716">If the state?s interest is compelling, then the legislation will and must be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="492.434" offset="2072991">I thought that the test you read earlier is that if any set of facts can be conceived, even hypothetically, that would justify the legislature?s action; the law will be sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="657.607" offset="2733784">It does not mention hotdogs and that is significant because in the French Quarter of New Orleans, over so many years, the hotdog peddler, peddlers, whatever you want to call them, have been distilled out to this one company and I would say that the factual determination contained in these affidavits certainly would not put Mrs. Dukes and Mr. Silliker on the same footing or on the same class as Lucky Dogs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1026.209" offset="4208135">It is the heart; the economic heartthrob of the City of New Orleans is the French Quarter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.441" offset="4245020">Hotel and motel construction in the French Quarter is a good indication of real estate values and is a good indication of the economic conditions and important contribution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.036" offset="4379498">So, we have a fairly unique situation as much you can as I pointed out in my brief to the Georgetown area of Washington and what it does for the City of Washington D.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.208" offset="4420145">And, the single most important factor in the French Quarter?s economy is its retailing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1093.628" offset="4477823">And, support for these establishes comes mainly from tourists and citizens who are charmed by this historic district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.356" offset="4504782">So, we are talking about not only favoring someone over someone else; we are talking about national historic preservation, and we have a vested interest in this national historic preservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.134" offset="4595792">I believe they erred gravely, because this area is the most important area of the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.981" offset="4635185">The City definitely, therefore, has a valid propelling interest in maintaining the French Quarter?s physical, social, and economic potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.372" offset="4664756">Preservation and protection to be of any significance at all must encompass both the physical and functional elements of the French Quarter that contribute to its identity and environmental unity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.525" offset="5853431">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.248" offset="5892302">I would like to first begin by pointing out that when you consider the legislative history to this permit law, it takes on an entirely different aspect as presented by the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.230" offset="5948204">This is not simply an identification of a public interest sending out of bids, obtaining people to bid on a lucky draw push cart or whatever maybe that particular interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.829" offset="6002643">This legislative history, as I have tried to point out and outline in my brief, is nothing but an indication to me of what I would, in best terms, describe as legislative chicanery and I follow this permit ordinance through other controversies, and if I can backup and demonstrate first to the Court, as I have tried to touch in my brief, where the City of New Orleans is doing something other than it would pretend in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.874" offset="6114760">That is, preserve the charm and beauty of Vieux Carre.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.388" offset="6128867">Firstly, the City of New Orleans long ago, in 1942, treated with its permit ordinance in a legitimate effort to regulate peddlers on the street and people who generally go about the streets of New Orleans hawking their wares or attempting to sell their wares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.261" offset="6204308">It was not about until around 1970, as I treat in my brief, that the City first began to regulate such things as religious activity, benevolence, and education amid the streets of the Vieux Carre.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.709" offset="6262091">It is no coincidence that at the same time that the City took upon itself to legislate and actually prohibit religious activity on the streets of Vieux Carre which precipitated a case before the Eastern District of Louisiana, which I did handle and was successful in denouncing that particular ordinance as it restricted religious activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.642" offset="6345892">But they also took upon themselves to begin to create -- first, they created exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.567" offset="6365536">They said ?generally, all permits are banned from the French Quarter except the following exemptions?, and this is where they began their scheme, the discriminatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.510" offset="6405347">Now, whether or not that was correct or not, I am not going to deal with it at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.837" offset="6422692">That is not the issue here, but I am giving the Court, hopefully, an idea of the background reiterating this background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.556" offset="6445575">They said ?all permits are banned with the exception of the following:? Paragraph 5 which is the important and crucial paragraph dealing with hot tamale pushcarts, and hot tamale and hotdog pushcarts, and alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.403" offset="6508896">They were satisfied with this for a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.205" offset="6520076">Now, at the time that they passed this ordinance, which is in the latter part of the 1971, Nancy Dukes was operating her pushcart selling food, stuffs, hotdogs, cotton candy, confections and alike on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.641" offset="6585905">She was selling hotdogs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2004.209" offset="8120129">One of her employees, in January of 1972, was arrested for selling hotdogs and foodstuffs in the Vieux Carre.</text>

            <text syncTime="2025.114" offset="8203720">Subsequent to that, in April of 1972, there appears the grandfather clause which says that all persons as of January of 1972 -- it was retroactive though passed in April of ?72.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.593" offset="8253667">All persons prior to January of ?72 who have not operated in the Vieux Carre area for more than eight years cannot obtain any permits aside from the fact that they did create some exempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2052.985" offset="8315211">Now, this lawsuit was filed in August of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.998" offset="8335273">Subsequent to that time, the City again amended its statute and deleted Paragraph 5, the hotdog and hot tamale pushcart exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.541" offset="9865422">And, I do not think that any ordinance, any City Council, any state legislature can simply decide that it is going to favor one man over another person for no other reason other than it decides to favor him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.986" offset="9923205">Now, I suspect that the City Council, I feel that the City Council, only had one purpose and it was not to promote the charm and beauty of the Vieux Carre.</text>

            <text syncTime="2634.713" offset="10642199">I think the legislative history belies that besides the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.673" offset="10657977">There were no standards set, there was no reasonable relationship between the discrimination, i.e., if you have been there for eight years you can sell hotdogs but you cannot if you have been any less.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.901" offset="10714924">Being a lifelong resident of the City of New Orleans, I can say, as I have stated in the brief, that these hotdog pushcarts in no way contribute to the charm and beauty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.997" offset="10755257">I think that much was made in the appendices provided by myself in the jurisdictional statement in the City of New Orleans, attached to its brief, of the character of these pushcarts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.034" offset="10803427">They do not lend it to the charm and beauty of the Vieux Carre, which is that most of the architecture goes back to the 1700s and the 1800s as New Orleans was then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.243" offset="10844282">It has been preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.438" offset="10849089">And then, we have what subsequently followed and what I mentioned in the brief that the City expanded the operation of this ordinance as grandfather clause, not only it went beyond the Vieux Carre area, it went to the central business district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.036" offset="10915440">Now, as it stands, though it was not the case when this case was decided in the lower court, and I point this out to demonstrate that this is a bogus suggestion made by the city that this promotes the charm and beauty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.407" offset="10972909">Now, the grandfather clause operates not only in the Vieux Carre, but over the central business district which has no relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.149" offset="11007913">There is nothing charming or beautiful about concrete and asphalt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.161" offset="11027975">And the City continues to do things in past ordinances subsequent to this which really contradict their position here taken today, and I think the Court should be apprised of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.904" offset="11434963">In so far as there, you had a situation of a creation of monopoly, a statewide monopoly for the transit system, granted there was a legitimate state interest to maintain a transit system, which was reliable, which could be controlled by state agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2881.978" offset="11631195">To allow these people to do this would allow them to run rush shot over other individuals of the callow of Mrs. Dukes who obviously, I think the Court can take notice, is not financially well here and is a small person as opposed to Lucky Dogs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.423" offset="11700994">And I would say, as to monopolies, they are generally created only after an interest is established, an interest which, here, protection of the charm and beauty of the Vieux Carre, but still you can not -- though you can establish a monopoly, you still cannot get away from the language of Morey v. Doud and McGowan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.755" offset="11778316">You have to establish some rational relationship between the discrimination and the particular purpose of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3022.208" offset="12192096">And I submit, and as I pointed out before, there is nothing which one could assume, as far as I am concerned, that a hotdog can do for the charm and beauty of the Vieux Carre by virtue of the fact that the person who is selling it has been there eight years selling it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.958" offset="12271090">We are not talking about as an Eslin case out of Florida, which I cited for your consideration, the situation of favoring doctors, such as doctors who would seek to be licensing, and exempt these doctors from the operation of the licensing law on the basis that they have been practicing for four years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3070.174" offset="12384044">And, there is nothing so qualifying about continually putting transient vendors in the street for eight years, which would justify this type of discrimination and go into and violate and deny Nancy Dukes her right to earn a living, which was one of the established constitutional rights and privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.237" offset="12460217">It has been established in Coryell versus Corfield, cited with approval in Shapiro v. Thompson, and noted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.479" offset="12497206">The right to earn a living is something you simply cannot take away from a person, and this is what this statute does without any rational basis whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.692" offset="12538062">If you really look at it -- and I submit further, and again in a repetition, there was nothing so unique about selling hotdogs for eight years that could somehow or other contribute more to the charm and beauty of the Vieux Carre than one selling it for merely two years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3584.221" offset="14440194">Well, that may be because the case is in Court and it may not be because they were under no restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.668" offset="14473944">At any rate, when his client was arrested, he was not selling hotdogs which is the only thing he could sell and, therefore, he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.665" offset="14522009">The Court of Appeals? opinion, we would respectfully submit, begins from the two faulty premises and flows there from the entire tenor of the opinion except for those couple of paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.317" offset="14568612">And, the question of grandfather clause is, in this case, illustrative of the desire not to favor any particular business but to maintain only those features which, over the years, have become landmarks in the area of the City of New Orleans, over 260 years, not to suggest that Lucky Dogs has been there that long, but all of the features, that some total of the functional and physical part of the French Quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.419" offset="14669027">It is this entire area of the City which is intentionally preserved and not individual establishments, and such intent must, must be viewed in its entirety and not as the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals did, dissected into each of its incidental side efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.872" offset="14730780">Therefore, we urge this Honorable Court to consider such action on the part of the City that it is representing a legitimate and compelling governmental interest and the presumption, therefore, should be applied as the case law states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.595" offset="14789712">And judicial restraint, which is exactly the point as well, should be invoked and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion should be overturned and the District Court?s opinion reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.795" offset="14826493">Thank you.</text>
