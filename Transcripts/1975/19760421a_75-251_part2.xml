            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="7.113" offset="131780">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.801" offset="146513">The complainants in this case are present and former male employees of the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.473" offset="177233">It was noted yesterday that the complaint is not reproduced in the Appendix, but it is well summarized by the District Court in the District Court opinion, which appears in the Appendix to the cross-petition, State's petition in this case, the petition in 75-283; and the complaint is summarized there at pages 6-A and especially 7-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.056" offset="283499">In essence, what the complaint was, it was an allegation that if these complainants had been females identically situated, they would be enabled to retire earlier, or they would receive larger retirement benefits than they were entitled to under the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.353" offset="388721">Which, in our view, presents a classic case of discrimination, an allegation of discrimination on the basis of gender and on no other basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.734" offset="438249">And fully comparable, for example, to the complaint that was before the Court in the preceding case argued yesterday, a complaint that if I were a member of a different race, I would not have been fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.067" offset="503555">And this complaint was upheld by the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.710" offset="542112">It is in the Appendix to the State's petition, the petition 75-283.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.573" offset="565622">And it is summarized on pages 6-A and 7-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.283" offset="584430">In upholding the complaint, the District Court specifically found on Page 12-A, with respect to the portions of the complaint that are particularly pertinent to the claim for back payments, the sort of disparity that existed under the state law, and I will refer very briefly to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.379" offset="680874">The plaintiff Matthews is now entitled to a monthly retirement payment of $923.10, whereas an identically situated female employee's benefits would be $935.63.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="162.343" offset="752659">When you say upholding the complaint Mr. Wallace, you mean a ruling that it did constitute an invidious discrimination under Fourteenth Amendment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="170.661" stopTime="291.271">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="170.661" offset="785991">Under Title VII that it constituted a violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.896" offset="802918">And the plaintiff Covert is getting a monthly benefit of $305.74, where an identically situated female would get $328.66.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.302" offset="856521">This, incidentally, is the only indication before us of the magnitude of the back payments that would be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.916" offset="894974">The difference between those monthly payments for a period going back certainly no further than the effective date of the 1972 amendments, if that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.217" offset="944188">Now, this type of complaint seems to us to be very dissimilar to the situation that was before the Court in the case adverted to yesterday, Geduldig against Aiello in 417 U.S. at Page 484.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.289" offset="1044499">There, both males and females had identical coverage for the disabilities that were covered by the insurance program, and the case presented the more complex question of whether the failure to include pregnancy among the disabilities covered, constituted discrimination on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.015" offset="1139375">And in holding that it did not, the Court pointed out, in Footnote 20 of that opinion, the dissenting opinion to the contrary, this case is thus a far cry from cases like Reed v. Reed and Frontiero v. Richardson, involving discrimination based upon gender as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.332" offset="1220668">The California insurance program does not exclude anyone from benefit eligibility because of gender, but merely removes one physical condition, pregnancy, from the list of compensable disabilities.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="291.271" offset="1268420">Mr. Wallace do you think Congress could now say that under the Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, California could not employ the type of health benefit program that was held to be constitutional in Geduldig?</text>

            <text syncTime="309.024" offset="1339369">Well, possibly so, but that would present a Katzenbach v. Morgan type of question, which --</text>

            <text syncTime="314.988" offset="1363297">Or Oregon against Mitchell.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="316.350" offset="1368730">Or Oregon against Mitchell which, in my view, is not what is involved here, because in order for Geduldig to be comparable to this case, you would have had to have a situation in Geduldig in which men and women were paid differently for appendicitis, even though they were, in all respects, identically situated with respect to the contributions they had made to the retirement program.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.681" offset="1466010">And the cases adverted to in that Footnote 20 seem to me to be the comparable cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.191" offset="1496103">The complaint and the finding here fully fit the test which this Court set forth in Reed against Reed, by providing dissimilar treatment for men and women who are thus similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.502" offset="1557335">The challenged section violates the Equal Protection Clause.</text>

          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="370.559" stopTime="451.503">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="370.559" offset="1585547">Well, Kahn against Shevin was a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.363" offset="1604773">But the case that seems to me most closely in point is Frontiero against Richardson, the next case I was about to advert to, in which the issue was a difference in the payment of dependency compensation, a fringe benefit very comparable to retirement compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.657" offset="1701948">And in that case, while there was some disagreement expressed about whether it was an appropriate occasion for deciding whether sex is a suspect classification under the Fourteenth Amendment, eight members of the Court agreed that the disparity in the payment of the fringe benefit compensation, solely on the basis of gender, was a violation of the equal protection concept inherent in the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.496" offset="1841338">And while that was, of course, a federal case, I see no basis for believing that that concept of equal protection is broader than the explicit guarantee of equal protection as well as due process in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.163" offset="1936006">So it seems to us that at least a prima facie case of a violation of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment had been shown here.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.718" offset="2130148">You said the State failed to do it, but under a Title VII claim there is no room for justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.214" offset="2156166">Under a Fourteenth Amendment claim, there is; and presumably the Fourteenth Amendment claim has never really been tried in the lower courts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="518.729" offset="2178213">It has not been tried, as the Court of Appeals pointed out and I am looking at Page 30-A of the same Appendix, the defendants, the State here, did not appeal from the court's determination that the Retirement Act violates Title VII, nor from the injunction against future payments from the Retirement Fund or from other State moneys under the retirement system in a manner which would discriminate against man on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.380" offset="2284792">Now, that it was open to the State to argue that the Act, as applied, was unconstitutional on the ground that there the disparity in payments was justifiable and not a violation of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, that the Katzenbach --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="564.278" offset="2360443">Not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, it could be a violation of Title VII and vice versa.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="567.748" offset="2374340">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.442" offset="2385103">But it was open to the State to argue that Congress exceeded its powers under Title VII, that it was an improper application of Katzenbach against Morgan, that Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment was not violated, that Congress could not reach this under the commerce power, an argument similar to that made in National League of Cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.416" offset="2460962">The State made none of these arguments, it is left standing here, a prima facie showing of a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.387" offset="2500877">And it seems to us that in this procedural posture, the State has chosen to argue merely that Congress is without the power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce, through a back pay remedy, the provisions of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; a prima facie violation of Section 1, since the State has given us no basis to question that prima facie showing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.615" offset="2621772">So for that reason, we think that in the present posture of the case, on the basis of the State's contentions, the case can be entirely answered as we have attempted to answer it in our brief, by reliance on the power of Congress to afford a remedy of this sort under the power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment conferred upon it by Section 5.</text>

            <text syncTime="656.921" offset="2730964">Mr. Wallace, do you think the answer would be the same if the State conduct was not required by the Fourteenth Amendment, but Congress, pursuant to its Fourteenth Amendment power, did require it and the Court upheld it on a Katzenbach against Morgan theory?</text>

            <text syncTime="681.623" offset="2829811">So long as Congress was within its powers under Section 5 to prohibit the substantive conduct as a violation of equal protection as interpreted under the statute; then, it seems to me, that the issue really is the same whether --</text>

            <text syncTime="709.770" offset="2942347">Well, I believe you would not, since Congress was purporting to act under the Fourteenth Amendment in the 1972 Amendments, which extended Section VII to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.039" offset="2979441">There is always the alternative theory that it was exercising the commerce power, but Congress believed that it really had more direct authority to act against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.087" offset="3031686">I do not think it is necessary to decide, even whether it was a prima facie showing of the violation of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.158" offset="3059898">It does seem to me that in the present posture of the case, the case can be answered entirely by reliance on the congressional power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, without facing the very complex and difficult question that this Court has never answered, about whether the Eleventh Amendment or non-constitutional concepts of sovereign immunity prevent Congress from conferring a remedy against a state by citizens of that state, not within the literal terms of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.697" offset="3238053">That issue has been addressed in some penetrating historical analysis in an amicus brief filed in 75-251 by a group of Civil Rights organizations, and I commend that to the Court's attention, if any of the Justices feel I need to comment on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.779" offset="3326451">And I should add that two very interesting, very recently published law review articles on this subject, not cited in the briefs, should be called to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.717" offset="3374203">One is in the December 1975 issue of Columbia Law Review by John E. Nowak, called the scope of congressional power to create causes of action against state governments in the history of the Eleventh and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.426" offset="3440972">And this one does include some historical analysis of the power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, which incidentally is supportive of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.298" offset="3476499">And the other recent publication is in the February 1976 Harvard Law Review, an article by Lawrence H. Tribe, called Intergovernmental Immunities in Litigation, Taxation and Regulation; separation of powers issues in controversies about federalism.</text>

            <text syncTime="893.157" offset="3675970">And that issue will, of course, be before the Court soon enough, undoubtedly, because the 1974 Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act did explicitly include an authorization of the kind of suit by employees against State and local government employers, that the Court held in the Missouri case was not authorized, but we see no need to reach it here.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.763" offset="3866350">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.425" offset="3880979">Yesterday my brother, Paul Orth, made reference to the fact that, as he expressed it, that there was a two-year inexplicable delay by the State to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.881" offset="3946807">What he was referring to is that at the approximate time the plaintiffs instituted their action.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.571" offset="3989543">The sponsor, or one of the sponsors of this case, the Connecticut State Employees Association, others sought to have the State Retirement Act amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.299" offset="4060492">It was not amended at that session or the following one.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.316" offset="4088600">I had -- let us say, as an Assistant Attorney General I have no, shall we say, cause to appear before the Legislature to advocate passage of bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.171" offset="4147950">I believe that the State Retirement Commission presented the bill, and it would seem to me that you can not blame the State or say that the State is acting in somewhat bad faith when the Legislature fails to pass a bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.674" offset="4234050">That perhaps, among other things, we may say that those that were advocating the passage of the bill did not advocate it well, perhaps they were not doing their jobs as lobbyists well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.734" offset="4290265">However, the mere fact that the Legislature had the bill before it, or had a bill before it, does not constitute an action of bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.433" offset="4357034">Among the other things that Mr. Orth said yesterday was that the plaintiff -- that the State should have promptly re-evaluated its employment practices upon the passage of the amendment of Title VII in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.939" offset="4439059">The illusions being that, I guess in the various briefs, that the State will do nothing until it is forced to do so by a Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.326" offset="4492662">Again, they do not take the practicalities of state government into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.457" offset="4521083">For example, let us say, at this approximate time, when they are saying that we were acting in bad faith, among other things that were going on is, for example, the State Police Department was trying to remove the minimum height requirements from its requirements for becoming a State Trooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.407" offset="4616900">And we were opposed by the same organization that is sponsoring this action, and we had to go all the way to the State Supreme Court before we could accomplish a civil libertarian type of thing, such as removing the minimum educational and the minimum height requirements from the State Police requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.647" offset="4741870">We feel that the awarding of attorneys' fees by the Court of Appeals is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.550" offset="4785547">We understand that the courts may issue injunctions against state officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.274" offset="4820446">But we also believe that in the process, the Federal Court should not -- may not impose a monetary award against the State, against the State's own consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.594" offset="5033710">I think that the only time when you could really apply costs against the State is, let us say, where the State was the plaintiff and the State then loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.033" offset="5083447">I think that perhaps should be the time when the State would pay costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1265.438" offset="5165054">In other words, the $20 shares, the entry costs and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.968" offset="5183130">And I believe that this Court has already said that costs were -- could be assessed against the State, and I am trying to differentiate and to say that the costs should not include attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.845" offset="5262647">I believe that, for example, in Edelman, that the ancillary object would be, for example, in this case, the order was issued against the Chairman of the State Retirement Commission, telling him to no longer pay in this discriminatory fashion, and that it was incidental to the order that it requires payments from the State treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.830" offset="5402663">However, because it is a future payment, and something that the Legislature can make provision for, it is something that can be handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.052" offset="5447490">It is when we get things such as back pay that -- let us say, the State cannot very well handle it, or cannot in a practical fashion handle it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.632" offset="5509870">In a small State such as Connecticut, where everything is, let us say, so tiny, for example, in our little office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.163" offset="5559921">I am in a unit of men that represents 85 State agencies, and we get an overall view of the State government, and we see that the difficulties that state agencies face in producing money at times that they need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.034" offset="5655424">In other words, there comes a time in this past year the State Police Department had to make the decision that it could not purchase a certain number of new cruisers, that it would have to make do with the older cruisers, because the money simply was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.434" offset="5741001">Mr. Orth suggested yesterday that perhaps a remedy would be to provide for installment plans, or for payments to be made in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.784" offset="5782484">I think that Chief Judge Clarie, in the District Court opinion, very wisely said he was going to leave the remedies to the Legislature, and that he would not attempt to enter into the field in which the Legislature had acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.006" offset="5875375">We have the delicate questions of individual officers of the State who are being sued for damages and whether or not those should be paid by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.442" offset="5941099">For example, we have a statute in Connecticut that says, in effect, that no State officer or employee will be personally liable for his actions unless willful or wanton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.581" offset="6001599">Now, under those circumstances, it is obvious that if action were brought against one of the Commissioners and his action were not willful or wanton, the payment would be coming from the State treasury, and obviously such an action would be indeed an action against the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.463" offset="6237119">And for several years in the past, the money that the State has been compelled to pay in has not been large enough to keep the fund actuarially sound.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.059" offset="6539512">That this is some sort of a conglomerate existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.554" offset="6561560">For example, the Connecticut Development Authority has a curious statute which says that, the statute speaks of the Department of Commerce, and then it says, there is created within the Department of Commerce a Connecticut Development Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.134" offset="6627806">So very clearly, inside the Department of Commerce, we have an Authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.407" offset="6744939">So that they have made guarantees that are satisfactory to the bond purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.944" offset="6775032">That the State actually stands behind them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.453" offset="6789139">But we do have a rather curious situation going on with this Authority, and it bothers me at almost every Session.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.448" offset="6833129">I believe that state governments need sovereign immunity and the Eleventh Amendment for very practical reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.313" offset="6868551">And that is, in order to be able to handle our physical existence, the State must be in a position to decide when it is waiving sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.779" offset="6922468">For example, the State has waived its sovereign immunity in automobile accident cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.430" offset="6945037">The statute says that when the automobile is owned by the State of Connecticut and insured by the State, you may bring an action directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.137" offset="6983803">So that where we get time to get ourselves set to handle the problem, then we may safely look to the future and, let us say, waive sovereign immunity in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.389" offset="7048900">For example, we have waived sovereign immunity as concerns certain aspects of the State Department of Health, and the statute says that damages may be paid out of the general fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.703" offset="7122148">So that again there is a way of paying once, let us say, the State has been found liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.898" offset="7162899">But, unless there is a way of paying, and somebody says, you must pay money or court says to the Retirement Authority, to the Retirement Commission or to the Department of Commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2074.005" offset="8399326">I believe that the only way open to this Court is to issue an order to the state official, compelling him to comply or to do his duty in a constitutional sense, and that if, as an incident of that, it requires that money be paid, then it can be -- it must be done in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.197" offset="8524087">I believe that the ancillary aspects are really only very incidental, and that the intent of the order of the Court should not be to compel the States to pay money, but the intent of the order of the Court should be to compel the official to do his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.868" offset="8654804">Charles Alan Wright wrote in Federal Courts, the Second Edition, the 1970 works, that he thought that the Court had decided that -- the Young court was fully aware of the possibility of holding that the Fourteenth Amendment had altered or limited the Eleventh Amendment and had expressly chosen not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.440" offset="8769116">And what Mr. Wright was trying to say is that each amendment must live and be given its validity within its own sphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.694" offset="8818121">We must try to have them both living at the same time and giving effect to both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.879" offset="8862843">And it is a delicate balance that requires each case to be analyzed as we handle each one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.439" offset="8905057">I do not believe that the mere -- let us say, rewriting of the doctrine of the Young case would necessarily be a great blow for liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.393" offset="8964930">I believe that, among other things that could happen, would be that corporate giants, such as in the Great Northern Life and Reed case, might claim gigantic tax windfalls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.636" offset="9017801">So that all is not that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.796" offset="9038490">As to the other aspects of attorney’s fees in there, many of the cases are, in effect, handled by the Attorney General’s office in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.333" offset="9088646">We, for example, handle all the cases that come before the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.363" offset="9116753">And the fact that there are, let us say -- I am trying to compare the EEOC load to our load; and we do a great deal of the civil rights work ourselves under our own Commission of Human Rights and Opportunities, and therefore there is not the great need for, let us say, the payment of attorney’s fees that my opponents would make appear necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.551" offset="9297521">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.378" offset="9304835">Again, the Eleventh Amendment and what it appears to embody, sovereign immunity, seemed fundamentally to embody the idea that somewhere along the line, the sovereign would do right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.254" offset="9368365">Now, here the sovereign, the State of Connecticut, is saying, for one reason or another, we have engaged in discriminatory conduct, and yet there is nothing we need to do about it, as regards to the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.948" offset="9439104">I think the inaction regarding the failure of the Legislature to do anything about this de jure discrimination, the face of its retirement laws, illustrates the principle that perhaps it is harder in governmental employment to get at and root out discrimination than in private industry, because it is hard to point the finger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.954" offset="9555088">And Congress recognized this, and Congress tried to provide, under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, an appropriate exercise of its power; tried to provide what is so vital in the civil rights area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.610" offset="9621752">And that is effective remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.766" offset="9634396">And these remedies go, and have an equitable aspect that not only concerns the future, but you have to get to the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.732" offset="9678281">And you get to the future by attorney’s fees and back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.065" offset="9699597">Those are the methods to eradicate discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.128" offset="9715793">And the method that Congress has chosen, as I indicated yesterday, does not impinge unduly upon federalism, as we know it in a society, and as we should know it in a society committed to the elimination of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.944" offset="9795101">The State is only saying, for one reason or another, we do not want to pay money for the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.685" offset="9830001">This is, in effect, a license to slow down on the anti-discrimination crusade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.655" offset="9869916">And it is a license to other States to do nothing, in effect, when charged with a discriminatory employment practice until a Federal Court finally is forced, usually in a suit by a private litigant, to blow the whistle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.336" offset="9948701">We ask the Court not to allow that license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.785" offset="9970435">The impact of the, call it retroactive, the monetary relief here, which I say is not really retroactive because it has a prospective thrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.234" offset="10020277">But that impact is relatively minimal in regard or in comparison with the impact of the change that took place in the retirement practices once the District Court issued its injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.761" offset="10090389">I thank the Court.</text>
