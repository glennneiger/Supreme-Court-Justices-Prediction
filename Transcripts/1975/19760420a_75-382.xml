            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="31.836" offset="230633">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.502" offset="237320">We are here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.154" offset="251948">That Court with one judge dissenting, reversed the District Court's determination that Section 232 (b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 empowers the President in certain cases to use the system of license fees to control or to adjust the imports of oil and other commodities into this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.725" offset="338257">The reasoning of the majority of the panel was that Section 232 (b) is a delegation by Congress to the President of the power only to impose quotas, but not to license fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.216" offset="388203">Hence, the Court upheld the contentions of the respondents that the fees at issue here are without warrant of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.701" offset="418087">Before coming to the merits of that discussion, I will just briefly as requested by the Court, the question of whether these suits are barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, neither we nor the respondents believe that they are so barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.773" offset="482453">Our position is simply that Anti-Injunction Act applies only with respect to taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and we think that both that the taxes are in the legislative history, support that view.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="118.078" offset="575658">Certainly here there is no disagreement about it as I gather?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="120.556" stopTime="672.338">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="120.556" offset="585584">There is no about disagreement about it, but we request it was discussed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.962" offset="607109">The Anti-Injunction Act is in the 1954 Code and it is contained in Chapter 76 of subtitle (f) which is now -- Section 7851 of that code which is quoted at page 20, footnote 13 of our brief, our main brief, provides that subtitle (f) which includes the Anti-Injunction Act applies to any tax imposed by this Title and of course the fees at issue here are not imposed by that Title.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.442" offset="749111">There is says, the subtitle (f) does not apply to taxes imposed under the 1939 Code except as subsections (b) and (c) provide and subsection (c) provides, in fact that Chapter 76 of subtitle (f) applies to the 39 code and that carries with the Anti-Injunction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.052" offset="827478">So, I think the clear implication is that the Anti-Injunction Act applies outside the 54 Code only when specifically made applicable and it is specifically made applicable only to the 1939 code.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.215" offset="880141">Hence we think it is not applicable of the fees here, whichever else they are, certainly note taxes imposed by the 1954 Code of the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.070" offset="915563">Respondents have made additional arguments in this direction in their brief and we can accept one of them and we prefer not to accept the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.008" offset="943357">Their first argument is that these fees are not taxes and hence do not fall under the Anti-Injunction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.325" offset="964569">That argument is in some attention with their argument later on in the brief that they are taxes and cannot be delegated, but in any event, we agree that they are not taxes and do not fall under the Anti-Injunction Act for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.130" offset="1011798">The other argument is that the Anti-Injunction Act would not apply to a petition for review FEA regulations in the Court of Appeals because Court of Appeals' jurisdiction for that purpose is given by the FEA Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.934" offset="1075015">However, the repeal of the statute in a policy is so basic as that expressed in the Anti-Injunction Act that I think are going to be expressed and there are certainly no intimation that those are to repeal the Anti-Injunction Act in the FEA Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.430" offset="1129036">So that I think that argument is incorrect, but the other two I think are correct in support of the notion that there is no application of the Anti-Injunction Act here.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.006" offset="1167384">With that I would like to turn to the merits if I may and discussed directly the President’s power under Section 232 (b) to impose license fees for the importation of foreign oil and perhaps I should say a word about why the President shifted from the imposition of quotas to the use of license fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.659" offset="1249931">Quotas have been used for some time in this field and had been found rather unsatisfactory for one thing there are quite rigid.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.478" offset="1281173">They specify particular amounts and as demand changes, domestic demand changes, they provide much too much protection for the domestic industry or much too little protection to domestic industry and it becomes an administrative nightmare constantly adjusting the size of a quarter, whereas a fee sets the margin of encouragement you wish to give to domestic industry, in this case for national security purposes, and as domestic demand changes, imports increase or decrease, but the margin remains there and you are given the amount of protection you desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.401" offset="1428922">Well, Section 232 (b) states that the Secretary of the Treasury must advise the President when he so finds that an article is being imported in such quantities or in the said circumstances as to threaten to impair the National Security and the President unless he disagrees, shall take such action and for such time as he deems necessary to adjust the imports of such article and its derivatives, so that such import will not threaten to impair the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.096" offset="1547726">Here the finding was made by the Secretary of State concerning Oil and Petroleum Products.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.867" offset="1566744">I should state in passing perhaps that this section of the statute has never been used in its history for any commodity other than oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.621" offset="1601748">Here the Secretary of the Treasury made that finding, the President agreed and he placed license fees on importation of oil to lessen the amounts in which it was imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.747" offset="1646260">Now, I take it that respondent do not challenge the finding that there was a threat to national security and indeed the language of the Court of Appeals suggest that they agreed that there was?</text>
            <text syncTime="394.297" offset="1680533">So all we are talking about is the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.983" offset="1699237">Now, I read the respondents in the Court of Appeals read it as if it said the President shall take such action as he deems necessary to adjust the imports provided that the only action he shall deem necessary as quotas.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.138" offset="1763916">That is not what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.020" offset="1771439">If it were a quota statute only it would be quite easy to write it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.256" offset="1784291">Many delegations of power in this field are written as quotas.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.899" offset="1802891">This is deliberately given very broad application, such action as he deemed necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.009" offset="1827341">So the plain text of the statute supports the President’s power to use license fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.887" offset="1850851">They are certainly without doubt a means of adjusting imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.606" offset="1861718">They have been used in the history of this Republic from the beginning, monetary exactions have been used from the beginning as a means of adjusting imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.954" offset="1891080">Now, we turn to the legislative history, defined and it bears out that plain meaning of the statute rather clearly and I think no other conclusions is really possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.302" offset="1920546">This national security provision appeared in this present form in the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.895" offset="1950848">The Senate Committee on Finance had before them number of proposals to control imports of various kinds of products.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.727" offset="1978224">Oil was certainly by no means the only kind of product that was considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.841" offset="1990659">There was zinc and lead, and fluorspar and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.694" offset="2006123">Now, one of these amendments that was before them was by Senator Neely which provided for a quota system on oils in Section 1 and provided for a general power to take such action with respect to any products he thought necessary in Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.338" offset="2068713">This was replaced, the Neely Amendment was replaced by what we have here which was then the Byrd-Millikin Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.847" offset="2098701">Now, that was a compromise of all these raised proposals, some of them are giving broad power, some are requiring quotas, some of them applying to different products by name and the Byrd-Millikin Amendment is quite broad in the sense and it simply says when there is a finding by the Director of the Defense Mobilization about effective imports on national security being threatening, the President is given powers to take such actions as it is deemed necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.959" offset="2219178">So as to all products they adapted the second Section of the Neely Amendment as a compromise in this Byrd-Millikin Amendment, adapted the same form of approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.636" offset="2253868">Now, the significance of that is when you realize that the Byrd-Millikin Amendment in this respect is identical to the approach of the Neely Amendment is that Senator Martin, who was a co-sponsor of Neely said that during the hearing that Neely gave the President the power to take such action as is necessary and that included the power to impose import quotas or to increase duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.865" offset="2358776">Now, by a common utilitarian proposition, if the Neely Amendment gave that power in the Byrd-Millikin, it is the same as the Millikin Amendment, then the Byrd-Millikin Amendment which we have before us now in the form of 232 (b) gives that power to use monetary exactions, but there is more evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.063" offset="2431606">In the floor debate, Senator Millikin stated that his amendment gave the President the power not only to use quotas, but also to use tariffs and import taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.447" offset="2469117">Senator Barkley who was a member of the Finance Committee said the power is to use quotas or to take such other steps as the President deemed desirable, he clearly thought there was something other than quotas that could be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.820" offset="2514571">Senator Bennett said the power included tariffs, quotas and stockpiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.713" offset="2534215">Senator Byrd in the colloquy with Senator Saltonstall which the Court of Appeals misinterpreted said the Amendment put other commodities on the same basis as agricultural commodities were already on.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.503" offset="2589281">Now, Senator Byrd have just been discussing with Senator Thye the President’s power under the Agricultural Adjustment Act to use duties as well as quotas to affect the size of imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.131" offset="2635883">Now, respondents reply in their brief as I understand it is that in the discussion of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, Senator Byrd referred to the use of quotas.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.508" offset="2673395">I do not know what to make of that because the Act does provide for the use of duties for use of monetary exactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.410" offset="2696905">Unless the respondents are suggesting that Senator Byrd did not understand the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and therefore, his misunderstanding of that Act must be carried over into the legislative history of this Act, but there is really no basis in the floor debate to say that Senator Byrd displayed a misunderstanding of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, it is an odd thing to attribute to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="738.156" offset="3055932">I think all of that is, well, I understand the motivation for that kind of liberal reading, but it just does not square with the legislative history or with the purpose of the statute or whether it is placed in Title XIX, I think we are effectively talking about the use of monetary exactions or quotas.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.711" offset="3714113">There are ranges of other restrictions that they were allowing him, of course they act on imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.689" offset="3738042">Now, we have discussed on our brief, Congressman Cooper discussed this in the house, nothing to the contrary was said in the debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.177" offset="3784017">The respondents keep stressing the fact that they can find a man who were not talking about this only use the word “quota.”</text>
            <text syncTime="926.936" offset="3811080">They never find anybody who says it is restricted to quotas.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.581" offset="3821633">It is limited to quotas.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.545" offset="3825500">There is no power to impose duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.591" offset="3837725">They just found the use of quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.587" offset="3845666">We have a number of examples in which it is perfectly clear that people are talking about monetary exactions as well as quotas.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.783" offset="3882446">Now in 1958, the Office of Defense Mobilization submitted a report to as sub-committee of the House, Ways and Means Committee which committee is in charge of this matter and that report explicitly stated that the legislative history of this provision indicated that President was authorized to impose new or increased tariff duties or quotas and after that report was submitted, this very provision was reenacted in the Trade Act of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.019" offset="4023403">Now, it was again reenacted in Section 232 (b) this time of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 where it is currently located and in 1970, this House voted to amend that statute to take away the President’s power to impose duties, fees, or charges and that memo was deleted on the floor of the Senate and was not enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.290" offset="4120474">And finally I think the Cabinet, in 1973 the President used the fee power on oil, that this unsuccessful 1973 Amendment would have denied him and after the exertion of that power under Section 232 (b), Congress went ahead and reenacted it in the Trade Act of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.705" offset="4222143">So I found it almost incredible to think that Congress did not know that it was enacting a power which on its face gave the power to impose license fees and which they have been told, involved tariffs or duties or fees which the President had exercised before they reenacted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.561" offset="4309601">I think there can hardly be a clear demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.186" offset="4324020">Now, the Court of Appeals suggested that this statute should not be read broadly because, although it was written broadly, that was odd because other statutes were written narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.878" offset="4366861">I think it is a very odd mode of statutory construction to say that a broad statute must be narrowed because look there are narrow statutes all around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.959" offset="4395178">I think the comparison indicates that when they wrote a broad statute, they meant to write a broad statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.950" offset="4423077">In any case, as I have just pointed out to you Mr. Chief Justice, there are other statutes that are quite broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.187" offset="4452020">This Trading with the Enemy Act is broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.266" offset="4472396">Now, at the end I want to come to two of respondent’s arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.390" offset="4484830">I think they tend to raise two arguments of constitutional dimension which do not, first of which they suggest would affect the way in which we read the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.467" offset="4529134">They do not suggest the statute is unconstitutional, but they suggest we alter its meaning in order to avoid deciding whether it is unconstitutional and I think there are fatal defects on that suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.626" offset="4577826">The suggestion is that this unconstitutional delegation to the President of congressional power and in order to avoid that we read it the way they want to read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.059" offset="4611576">The odd thing about that is that if it were too broad a delegation of legislative power, it is difficult to see why respondents think that quotas remain valid, although fees do not, but they attempt to salvage that point by saying the quotas are laid under the commerce power while these license fees are laid under the taxing power and that for reasons which are not disclosed and are certainly not obvious the Tax Delegation Doctrine is much more stringent when applied to a delegation of taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.097" offset="4739681">I do not think this is by the way a delegation of the taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.531" offset="4749398">I think this is a commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.153" offset="4755877">It is common to use monetary exactions as modes of regulation under the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.315" offset="4776566">It is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.712" offset="4782208">This is in light of the taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.440" offset="4793075">Now, as I have mentioned before, of course when they argue --</text>

            <text syncTime="1218.736" offset="4978231">Yes and I wish it had not slipped my mind because it is a commerce case in the 20s or 30s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.640" offset="5005921">I will try to think of it as I go along here when we get back up in which at that point was addressed in the courts that there is no reason you cannot use monetary exactions through the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.527" offset="5049388">But here, respondents are saying that although this thing is not a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act, is it a tax when we get to delegation doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.145" offset="5095886">They have a concept of tax which is kind of accordion like and it collapses and unfolds according to current needs of the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.505" offset="5121382">I do not think it is a tax, but I do not think it matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.146" offset="5139877">Worse than that I think respondent’s argument is in consistent in terms of constitutional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.588" offset="5169656">Look at that brief, at page 34, note 44, they give us the reason why delegation doctrine applies more stringently when taxes are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.220" offset="5224200">The reason turns out to be Chief Justice Marshall’s statement of the power to tax involves the power to destroy, and therefore, we have to control this thing much more carefully, but then it is too bad they put it that was because at page 26, note 30, they are arguing a different point and there they say that 232 (b) is the very statute, although it gives no power to tax which is too dangerous for the President to have, it does give him the power to place a complete embargo and destroy the commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.092" offset="5379681">Now, they say the power to destroy does not imply the power to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.757" offset="5394309">Now, so far as I can make out the argument runs something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.606" offset="5409774">The President cannot have the power to tax because it involves the power to destroy, but he already has the power to destroy and that is why he cannot have the power to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.728" offset="5450211">Now, the dominant characteristic of that position I think is kind of in coherence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.779" offset="5478424">There is really no reason rooted in constitutional policy why delegation doctrine should be applied more stringently to an import fee than to the power to embark or set a quota and I suppose that is the reason that this Court held in Hampton &amp; Co. against United States, and held unanimously that there is no distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.838" offset="5570688">It was there argued, but the delegation of the President to raise import duties is unconstitutional although other kinds of delegation would not be and Mr. Chief Justice Tuff and the unanimous Court said there was no such distinction between delegations under the commerce power and those under the power to levy taxes and fix custom duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.238" offset="5644249">In the second place, as I have mentioned, these things are laid under the commerce power and not the power to tax and finally I would suggest that there is no delegation doctrine issue in this case and the suggestion that we avoid problems of delegation doctrine by reading a statute contrary to its intent in this language is therefore a device that we need not resort to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.129" offset="5747798">The delegation doctrine cases which stuck down statutes, the Panama Refining case and the Schechter Poultry case, even if we assume that they have not been undercut and certainly a case like Southwestern Cable case suggest that they have been funk in at least in some dimension, but even if we assume they have not been undercut and still stand as perfectly good law, they are not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.352" offset="5864722">One can just compare the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.555" offset="5869529">In Panama Refining Section 9 (c) of the National Industrial Recovery Act gave the President completely unguided discretion whether or not to make it criminal, the interstate shipment of hot oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.001" offset="5919266">Unlike the statute before is now; Congress provided no criteria whatever for whether or not he should make it criminal required no findings as a predicate to his action and declared no policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.196" offset="5968063">The President was not only unfettered, he was completely unguided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.868" offset="5982796">Now, in Schechter Poultry, Section 3 of the national Industrial recovery Act authorized the President to impose codes of fair competition on industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.576" offset="6021666">But when we look at the statutes, the power was to regulate industry and always all together had nothing to do with competition or fair competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.877" offset="6050819">There was no policy guidance and in fact all that Congress had done with him to the President is commerce power and left him to legislate it at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.734" offset="6090211">Nothing of that sort has happened here, not remotely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.493" offset="6105258">The Congress here provides criteria for the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.155" offset="6115916">They provide criteria which are as definite as the subject matter admits them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.574" offset="6145591">The fact as I say are listed in 232 (c) and here unlike those cases, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to make a study and a finding prior to the President’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.179" offset="6196060">Now, I discussed already the fact that the respondents try to make this case sound like Schechter by talking about the various things that the President might and I think I have adequately suggested why the legislative history and the placement of the statute confine it, so there is not anything like Schechter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.913" offset="6267008">I have no time to discuss their final constitutional argument which is the uniformity requirement as to duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.152" offset="6295952">You will find substantive arguments as to that and are included in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.553" offset="6309535">I would suggest here only that the issue is not really properly before the Court because it is not alternative means, an alternative ground for sustaining the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.456" offset="6349137">The judgment below really requires the District Court to hold that no fees at all may be exacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.987" offset="6379230">This theory would support a judgment which eliminated the exemptions from the fees which introduced the uniformity, but we could exact fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.771" offset="6418414">So a different judgment would be required and for that reason I think that argument is not proper before the Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.217" offset="6464180">In short, what we have here is an energy crisis that endangers the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.015" offset="6479331">We have an energy crisis which Congress foresaw and provided for quite deliberately and repeatedly delegated the President the power to cope with this threat by unlimited means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.533" offset="6525411">The President responded, and I suggest neither the Court of Appeals reasoning nor the argument of respondents here withstand analysis nor provide any reason to take this delegated power away from the President and we ask that the judgment below be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.449" offset="8181157">I will get back to the exact wording and the exact meaning of that statute, but I would like to emphasize our position that the Court should give this a very narrow and careful construction because in effect, the statute under the interpretation of the government undermines the whole tariff structure of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2187.340" offset="8852713">The reason why it really has a sweep far broader than a tax is that the money is paid in the fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="2199.322" offset="8900569">So, in that sense it is certainly a tariff and has all the incidents and the economic effect of a tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.724" offset="8930244">But the moneys are paid into a fund and the government allows exemptions based upon various parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.434" offset="8969010">So that certain parts of the county because of these exemptions do not pay as high a license fee as others, the result is that the imposition is not uniform and it is in violation of the Uniformity Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.272" offset="9044451">Now, I believe and I can only speculate that the government set this up as a license fee system in order to avoid that problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2945.769" offset="11886365">That is quite easy and there are two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.802" offset="11894515">First, the government had abolished the tariff and also had put exemptions on the fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.462" offset="11925131">So the tariff was not being felt by that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.786" offset="11938505">The Circuit Court mentioned that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.031" offset="11947387">Also, the Congress in 1974 mentions specifically that it had not gotten to the problem of the oil tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.083" offset="11983645">Much important, Your Honor, is the 1962 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.476" offset="12001199">Look at that! That specifically gave the government the power which the government now claims today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.377" offset="12032860">It specifically gave the tariff for security reasons and that was rejected in 1962 and Senator Byrd gave up a very complete analysis of that, of the reasons why it was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.380" offset="12096807">That is a far more important indication because during the 60s and in 1958, the protectionists tried to add the tariff power to this section and were unable to and only in 1970 when for the first time after 15 years the government, the President’s Task Force reported that perhaps a tariff could be put on, did Congress attempt legislation the other way?</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.063" offset="12219583">It abandoned the 1970 legislation because President Nixon promised not to put one on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.443" offset="12249049">It was not until 1973 that he put a mild one on and a bite of it as the Circuit Court said, the bite of it was not felt and was not dealt with in 1974.</text>

            <text syncTime="3526.409" offset="14208964">I would like to point out in the first place that the tariff on oil is in effect in this case involves in no way the assertion of the power to remove any tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.309" offset="14240520">The tariff laws are not at stake in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.104" offset="14251700">Secondly, in reply to a question from Mr. Justice Powell, we discussed the 1962 unsuccessful amendment tool in this law which would have given the President explicit power to lay duties and impose quotas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.100" offset="14311677">The reason that was not passed because it was not like this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.591" offset="14325679">In the first place, it was not a national security statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.024" offset="14335397">The President was empowered to do anything when the national interest was involved, a much broader statute and furthermore, there were no criteria in the statute for when he should any of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.744" offset="14386283">If there was a statute like Schechter, the NIRA in any sense it was that statute and that was why it was rejected by the Congress.</text>
