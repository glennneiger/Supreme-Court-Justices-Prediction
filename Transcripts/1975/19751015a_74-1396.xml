            <text syncTime="304.367" offset="1322352">The facts show that no sales are made to retail customers, all sale to be made to wholesale and on all such imported tires and tubes the importer has paid to the United States the 4% import duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.586" offset="1379194">The tires are imported without packaging and are never altered or modified in any way from the original form in which they were imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.868" offset="1416392">Now, the Supreme Court of Georgia, may it please the Court, expressly recognized at page A7 of the Appendix to the petition for certiorari that the individual tires are not treated or altered in any manner, but they, nevertheless, deny immunity upon the ground, as shown at page A18 of the Appendix to the petition for certiorari, that the tires had lost their status as imports when they were segregated by size and style and stacked in the importer’s warehouse with other similar imported tires of the same size and style and it is this decision, may it please the Court, which is presently here for review and we believe the decision is erroneous and our contentions are based primarily upon four facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.477" offset="1618789">Number one, the original form had not been changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.593" offset="1639269">Number two, the tires were still in the flow of import distribution and had not reached the point of final destination as they had in Youngstown, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.831" offset="1684200">The right to sell which has never been seriously challenged until now, the importer’s right to sell, and four, the unequal treatment accorded to unpackaged imports as compared with packaged imports as we were just discussing with Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.814" offset="1752118">First, it is undisputed, Your Honors, that the tires were imported without packaging and at all times remained property of the importer in his warehouse, in the original form in which imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.988" offset="1812827">And, in 1827 this Court held in Brown versus Maryland in Chief Justice Marshall’s landmark decision that where these things imported, if it would please the Court, remains the property of the importer in his warehouse in the original form or package in which it was imported and “a tax upon it is to plainly a duty on imports to escape the prohibition in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.084" offset="1953261">References to the term “original form” are found in many subsequent decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.394" offset="1982414">And we suggest that the plain and natural meaning of those words is that where an article is imported without packaging, holding such an article in its unaltered original form in which imported, is equivalent to holding a packaged import in the original package in which it was imported, and that is the meaning that has been given to these words by the Courts of New York, Florida, and North Carolina and those decisions are cited in our brief and, in our judgment, was the meaning intended by Chief Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.360" offset="2146358">Here, the Georgia Court ignored and disregarded the words “original form” completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.613" offset="2179377">They treated them as being completely meaningless and that is precisely what the tax officials in this case are asking this Court to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.276" offset="2222009">And, we suggest respectfully that the Court has not done so for nearly 150 years and no persuasive reason has been or can be advanced for doing so at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.712" offset="2283762">The second factor that we rely upon is what we call the final destination factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.416" offset="2306541">It is undisputed that the tires are still in the flow of import distribution, have not reached their final destination, the importation journey has not definitely ended nor have the tires been irrevocably committed to the use for which they were imported --</text>

            <text syncTime="619.201" offset="2581663">But I say that, Mr. Chief Justice, because, one, as we all know one of the important reasons for the inclusion of the Import Clause in the Federal Constitution was a desire of the framers to prevent taxation by a seaboard state with their great ports of entry of imported goods flowing through to inland states and that was plainly stated in Brown versus Maryland and this Court reaffirmed it in the 1959 Youngstown decision where the Court said the constitutional design was to immunize imports from taxation by the importing states and all others.</text>

            <text syncTime="793.301" offset="3278087">Well it does, but that has been construed to include a general ad valorem tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.592" offset="3299299">In Low versus Austin in 1872, the Court held that or California made that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.260" offset="3321973">California made the same argument again in 1946 in Richfield Oil and the Court, again, rejected it in an opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas where he said that it would entail substantial revision of the language of the Import Clause to substitute for the prohibition against any tax the words in a discriminatory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.246" offset="3421865">And so, for those reasons, I respectfully answer Your Honor’s question by saying that no, I do not think my goods should be required to bear part of the expense of protecting the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.658" offset="3487485">Coming back now, if I may, for a moment to the final destination factor, we submit that that is essential and vital to a determination of whether the tires are still in the flow of import distribution, and are therefore, still imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.093" offset="3557284">The Georgia Court disregarded this fact and to do so is to lose sight of one of the underlying purposes of the Import Clause and the issue which really lies at the very heart of this case and that is, if it please the Court, whether the tires have retained their distinctive character as import.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.786" offset="3640040">And I cannot think of a better case to demonstrate this than this Court’s decision in Youngstown, where the Court held that the ore and lumber there involved had lost their distinctive character as imports and in so doing, the Court gave major weight to two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.378" offset="3726453">One, the importation journey definitely had ended, and two, the articles had been irrevocably committed to use in manufacturing at the point of final destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.573" offset="3783191">And we respectfully suggest to the Court that the same consideration should be given to the final destination factor here because here, in short contrast, if the Court please, to the facts in Youngstown, we have undisputed evidence which shows, first, the tires are imported for sale and sold only at wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.892" offset="3880471">Two, they flow out from the importer’s warehouse to franchise dealers in six states in the original form in which imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.380" offset="3918401">And three, it is such dealers who sell the tires at retail for local consumption at the point of final destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.193" offset="3961659">And we respectfully submit that under those circumstances, while the tires are in the importer’s warehouse, they have neither completed their import journey nor have they been irrevocably committed to use it at the final point of destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.863" offset="4024353">On the contrary, they are in the language of Chief Justice Tony, if I may be permitted to quote a brief statement, Mr. Chief Justice, “merely intransitive and on their way to the distant cities, villages, and country for which they are destined and where they are expected to be used and consumed and for the supply of which they were in truth imported.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.926" offset="4124559">That precise language from the license cases was quoted in the Youngstown decision, in 1959 and we submit, it is clearly applicable here and under these circumstances, the tires fall squarely within the underlying purposes of the Import Clause and clearly retain their status as imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.715" offset="4207733">Moving along, our third factor, may it please the Court, is the importer’s right to sell its goods, free from local taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.199" offset="6117702">My final point, if the Court please, I think I did not finish the right to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.986" offset="6148840">It is unquestioned here that we pay the 4% import duty and we say that by so doing, we acquire the right not only to import the tires, but to sell them and until they are sold, they retain their status as imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.020" offset="6208921">And the final factor is that unpackaged imports, in our judgment, should not be accorded a lesser degree of immunity than that which is generally recognized for packaged imports and that is precisely the result which the Georgia Supreme Court arrived at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.314" offset="6278094">And in so doing, we think that it violated long-standing and fundamental constitutional prohibitions because the intent and purpose of the Import Clause was to command a uniform degree of immunity for all imports whether packaged or unpackaged and unless we are to ignore that constitutional command, it cannot be successfully argued that unpackaged imports are entitled to less immunity than packaged imports.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hosea Alexander Stephens, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1584.048" offset="6441098">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.940" offset="6476624">Argument in behalf of the respondent, I respectfully submit, should begin by noting that the right of a state and its political subdivisions to levy non-discriminatory ad valorem taxes on property located within its boundaries is an inherent attribute of sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.846" offset="6576308">The constitution of Georgia so declares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.948" offset="6596683">Its taxation scheme expressly states that the property of non-residents shall not be taxed higher than that of residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.265" offset="6641927">So, there is no contention here on the part of the petitioner that there has been any discrimination against the petitioner on the ground that it is a non-resident of Georgia rather than a resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.046" offset="6697098">Now, the last term as is fully known to the members of the Court, in the National Cash Register case, there was a determination as to when American-made goods, possessing very unique qualities, unsuited for use except by some foreign nation, when they become exports and in this particular case, to some extent, the reverse side of the coin is before the Court and that is when foreign-made goods actually cease to be imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.871" offset="6884343">Now, the Georgia Supreme Court, after cataloging numerous cases, concluded that, in the language of Mr. Justice Gunter, that the case has established a sort of two-hat approach to the import process and it depends on which hat the particular concern is wearing, whether that of an importer or that of a wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.573" offset="6999178">And certainly, the Supreme Court of Georgia spent some time analyzing Brown against Maryland and it is obvious that the Supreme Court of Georgia had no desire to ignore the holdings of that Court in that particular decision, but it did lay emphasis upon the factual aspect of this particular situation and while it is not a link to the record, it began with the first specific matter which is that Michelin owns a warehouse in Gwinnett County, Georgia on the north side of Atlanta, and utilizes a bonded warehouse in Clayton County, Georgia on the south side of Atlanta, thereby, a permanent distribution, a center has been set up in the Atlanta area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.303" offset="7242117">Bulk shipped lots of tires in closed in sea vans and over-the-road containers arrive at these warehouses at recurring intervals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.588" offset="7283285">The sea vans and over-the-road containers are opened, entries are made into it and the tires are placed on pallets. Each pallet with tires loaded on it, it is then moved into the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.898" offset="7344517">The tires are segregated by size and style, as was mentioned by Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.486" offset="7374819">They are then stacked. Four stacks of five tires each on a pallet with a heavy cardboard comb put down between it and another pallet of three tires placed over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.238" offset="7421839">There is no question, but a new shipment is introduced into that warehouse with the residue of what has been left from previous shipment, and furthermore, that shipment arriving from France and shipments arriving from Nova Scotia are distinguishable only by the word “made in France” or “made in Canada” appearing on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.153" offset="7545450">Then, the process of getting them out of the warehouse was developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.989" offset="7568856">Orders received by Michelin in Gwinnett County, Georgia at its facility, they are on Highway I85, are filled from this -- I am going to use the word “co-mingled” inventory because I submit that is what it shows had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.690" offset="7647641">They are shipped by common carrier, united parcel service, or a dealer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2034.806" offset="8244069">Yes sir, January 1 of each year is the critical date for ad valorem tax purposes in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.467" offset="8290776">It is the position of the respondents, may it please the Court, that this matter is, in reality, controlled by May against New Orleans which has already been mentioned by Mr. Justice Rehnquist and discussed to some extent by the philosophy of Burke against Wells, that is the case in New York City in which an import firm established a wareroom and was vending in the original package articles imported from Ireland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.313" offset="8450123">And the State of New York, instead of issuing an ad valorem assessment on the property itself, issued an assessment on the capital of the company utilized in that particular process which was retained from the sales of the goods, but much of the language in that opinion indicates that if it had been an ad valorem assessment the result would have been the same because the Court in its opinion, went back to Brown versus Maryland, discussed when the Original Package Doctrine loses its force or validity, and placed the two in exactly the same context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.615" offset="8655341">Now, as to what an original package is, in our brief we have stressed a line of cases holding that if, as the Supreme Court of Georgia did, the sea van or over-the-road container concept is rejected as the original package that the aggregation of goods is a definition which emerged very early in jurisprudence in the Austin case from Tennessee and that the aggregation of goods where they are not individually wrapped, constitutes the original package.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.284" offset="8826077">And, we rely upon EJ Stanton &amp; Sons case from California in which it was referred to as invisible customer and that is some language to which the petitioner took strong exception in the petition for certiorari and in the briefs, but it merely illustrates the premise that an aggregation of goods or, as the Supreme Court of Ohio termed it, the commercial unit of importation, when that is broken, the package is broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.889" offset="8960451">And in this particular case when Michelin established a distribution center in Gwinnett County, Georgia and even in Clayton County, Georgia, although they are not a party here, and on a regular sustained recurring basis just as in Burke against Wells in New York, on a week-to-week, day-to-day, month-to-month basis had goods available for shipment, received goods to replace those shipped, we submit, if the Court please, that that really is the end of the importation process and that the Supreme Court of Georgia correctly so determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="2307.984" offset="9336823">I believe that was the holding of the Volkswagen Pacific case from California, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2318.839" offset="9380291">In that particular case, the facts were packaged automobile parts and completed VW and Porsche automobiles were being brought in by sea going vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.272" offset="9457927">And as I remember, and do not hold me to this because I have not read this case today, as I remember, the packaged auto parts were held exempt, but the automobiles had to have things done to them to get them ready and while the outward form or shape of the vehicle was not changed, it could no longer be in the original form because it would be the difference between being able to crank it up and drive it away and not crank it up and drive it away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.515" offset="9594913">I believe the California case has ruled only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.367" offset="9614348">As I remember, this Court declined a grant to certiorari in that particular case which I fully appreciate, is not very decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.316" offset="9678192">Now, as to the statement in Brown versus Maryland which has been urged by petitioner’s counsel here, in a footnote to our brief, we invite attention to an article by Professor Thomas Reed Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.661" offset="9759485">I was never so fortunate as to attend that university or be one of its students, but I have always regarded him as a very outstanding writer and his comment was that the language of Mr. Marshall, certainly was broad enough to include sale, or use, or breaking bulk and we submit when an import firm gets into the distribution business such as shown in the record in this case that the maintaining of the tires for inventory meet the test of use, as referred to as Youngstown and it certainly meets the test of Burke against Wells where they had a permanent wareroom in New York City and was vending from the original package.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.739" offset="9975883">If the Court would bear with me, I would like to conclude with just one quote from May against New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.794" offset="10040040">“The goods imported, lost their distinctive character as imports and became a part of the general mass of the property of Louisiana and subject to local taxation as other property in that state the moment the boxes, cases, or bales in which they were shipped reached their destination for use or trade and were opened and the separate packages therein exposed to sale.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.384" offset="10134394">Now, we submit that the breaking of a bulk shipment of tires, the aggregation of goods, the commercial unit of importation or whatever it is and the exposing of the individual tires for sale, if that occurs, the import process has terminated and just as the Supreme Court of Georgia said, then the concern dawns the hat of a wholesaler.</text>

            <label>Mr. Earle B. May, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2559.458" offset="10342747">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.277" offset="10354032">Mr. Justice Blackmun, in answer to your question, there are photographs which are part of the original record in this case, color photographs showing the form in which the tires are in fact delivered to the importer’s warehouse in Gwinnett County, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.361" offset="10410352">Exhibits P2, 3, and 4 to the record of those photographs and finally, I would like to mention Burke versus Wells which Mr. Stephens mentioned, as we read it, is an income tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.839" offset="10468239">It was not a tax on imports and clearly is not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.495" offset="10482868">I would like to conclude, if I may Mr. Chief Justice, by saying that when you carefully consider all of the arguments raised by the tax officials, the result sought would require a substantial revision of the language of the import clause as well as the overruling of the entire Brown versus Maryland line of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.050" offset="10565101">And we respectfully submit to the Court that it has consistently rejected all efforts to overrule Brown versus Maryland and expressly refused to undertake revision of the import clause in Richfield Oil in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.887" offset="10624451">And for this reason, we suggest, that these arguments should not be urged before this Court, but before the only branch of government which has the power to consent to the state taxation of imports which is the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.812" offset="10688085">As the Court recognized in HOOVEN &amp; ALLISON, Congress has the power to lay down its own test for determining when immunity is and unless and until that body sees fit to do so, we respectfully urge the Court to continue to follow the test which it has consistently applied for almost 150 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.556" offset="10791112">That test, in our judgment, is contained in the Brown versus Maryland lines of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.494" offset="10814832">Those decisions reflect what we believe are a most thorough and careful consideration of what the framers intended when they originally adapted the Import Clause and we believe they are as sound today as they were when originally written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.237" offset="10889855">Accordingly, we respectfully urge, Mr. Chief Justice, that such decisions be followed in this case and the decision of the Georgia Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.981" offset="10924859">Thank you very much.</text>
