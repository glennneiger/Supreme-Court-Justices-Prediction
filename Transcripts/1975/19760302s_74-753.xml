            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="9.539" offset="111808">This case comes to us from the United States Court of Claims and it concerns the basic jurisdiction of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.786" offset="148797">Mr. Testan and Mr. Zarrilli are government trial attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.635" offset="168128">They requested their employing agency to reclassify their positions to a higher grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.981" offset="193519">They claim that their duties met the requirements for that higher grade and were identical to the duties of other attorneys in another agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.433" offset="231344">Thus they said under the principle of equal pay for a substantially equal work prescribed in the Classification Act, they were entitled to the higher classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.228" offset="282544">Relief was denied by their agency and by the Civil Service Commission, and the two attorneys then sued the United States in the Courts of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.484" offset="315563">They sought reclassification and back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.594" offset="336043">That Court held that it was not empowered to direct reclassification but it further held that if the Civil Service Commission were to decide that it had made an erroneous classification, then the Court could award money damages for back pay lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.522" offset="399677">It also held that court had power to order the commission to reconsider the classification decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.320" offset="426949">Thus, it remanded the case to the commission to make the comparison and to report back.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.830" offset="448892">We reverse, we hold that the Tucker Act which is the statute primarily concurring jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims whenever a substantive right enforceable against the United States for Money damages exists, does not in itself support the action taken by the Court of Claims in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.566" offset="523916">We also hold that the neither the Classification Act nor the Back pay Act creates a substantive rights in these respondents to back pay for the period of the claimed wrongful classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.742" offset="576578">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
