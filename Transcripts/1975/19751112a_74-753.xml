            <text syncTime="48.405" offset="296981">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.444" offset="309101">This case is here on the Government’s petition for writ of certiorari to review a decision by the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.371" offset="336791">Two questions were presented in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.546" offset="349539">First, whether the Court of Claims had jurisdiction over this case and second, whether in determining the correctness of respondent's classifications, the Classification Act requires that there positions be compared with the positions held by employees in another Federal Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.809" offset="414532">The relevant facts are both few and largely undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.601" offset="437728">Respondents were employed as trail attorneys by the Defense Supply Agency of the Defense Personnel Support Center in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.015" offset="471374">There positions are subject to the Classification Act and under that Act, they were at all relevant times classified at civil service grade GS-13.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.295" offset="516514">On December 9, 1969, they submitted requests to their employing agency seeking reclassification to civil service grade GS-14.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.406" offset="552981">In support of those requests, they argued that they were entitled to reclassification at GS-14 under standards, the general standard promulgated by the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.736" offset="598225">And secondly, that their positions were identical to positions occupied by attorneys employed by the Air Force Logistics Command in Dayton, Ohio, positions that were classified one grade higher than their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.248" offset="668337">After an audit by a position classification specialist, respondents' employing agency informed them that they were properly classified at GS-13.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.916" offset="710969">On appeal, the Civil Service Commission endorsed that conclusion, made the same finding and denied respondents request for a classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.028" offset="759452">The Commission also ruled and informed respondents that the comparisons that they had requested did not constitute a proper method of classification under the Classification Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.909" offset="810966">Respondents then filed the present suit in the Court of Claims, seeking an order directing their reclassification to GS-14 as of the date of the first administrative denial of their requests and backpay accrued from that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.671" offset="877944">The Court of Claims in a four to three decision ruled that it had jurisdiction over the case under the Tucker Act and on the merits that the Civil Service Commission had been arbitrary and capricious in not making the comparisons that respondents had requested, the Court therefore, remanded the case to the Civil Service Commission with instructions to undertake the requested comparisons and to report the results to the Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Rupp</label>
            <text syncTime="231.056" offset="1027573">There -- I know of one that resulted in a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.363" offset="1056726">There is case decided by the District of -- District Court in the District of Columbia Chapter in which the Court held the comparisons were not required, were not appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.535" offset="1105418">I did not know and I may have misconceived your question initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.481" offset="1117225">I did not know whether many such requests have been made directly to the Civil Service Commission and then had not been pursued after they have been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.305" offset="1144497">I do know that the Civil Service Commission’s policy is uniformly to deny such requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.012" offset="1183368">As noted in our reply brief the central and in our judgment dispositive issue presented by this case is whether any federal statute or statutes gives respondents a substantive right to recover from the United States money damages for the period of a wrongful civil service classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.914" offset="1270930">In assuming jurisdiction in this case, the Court of Claims conceded that the classification process involves substantial discretion, a concession which I think flows naturally from this case decision in the Ramsbeck case.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.648" offset="1329862">The Court of Claims also conceded that it was without power to direct respondents for classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.005" offset="1355358">The Court reasoned, however, that if respondents found administratively to be entitled to reclassification, that determination could create a right to money damages or right to reclassification which the Court could then force by way of a money judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.016" offset="1427351">Well, I think it’s fair to say that the Court of Claims dealt at best equivocally with the issue of its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.710" offset="1454101">The Court appeared to assume first that a substantive right to the recovery of money damages against the United States could appropriately be found by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.417" offset="1492971">And second, that the history of the relationship between the Federal Government and its employees, evidence is an intent on Congress’ part to permit the recovery of money damages for the period of wrongful Civil Service Classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.852" offset="1550754">We submit that both of these assumptions which are together essential to what holding at the Court of Claims had jurisdiction over this case, so that the cause of action was stated are incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.604" offset="1613761">It is settled of course that the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act is limited to cases in which the claimants seek actual presently due money damages, claims founded upon the Constitution, any federal statute, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.488" offset="1689307">To that extent then we acknowledge that Congress has waived in the Tucker Act a portion of the sovereign immunity or the historic immunity of the United States to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.937" offset="1735074">But its essential I think to recognize that the Tucker Act is not itself create any substantive rights to the recovery of money damages from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.696" offset="1774048">Whether the claimants such as respondents are entitled to the recovery of money damages depends in our view, upon the existences of the statute or combination of statutes, a substantive provision of some sort in a statute expressly and unequivocally waiving the immunity of the United States to the recovery of money damages from the Public Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.695" offset="1874045">It is not sufficient for these purposes in our view nor indeed is it even relevant that the existence of such a substantive right might be thought responsive to a particular conception of public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.421" offset="1920961">The settled rule followed in countless cases, many of which are cited in our main brief at pages six through eight, prohibits Courts from implying authority to collect upon the Public Treasury which is precisely what the Court of Claims did here and what respondents would have them do.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.016" offset="2007374">Respondents' contention to the contrary apparently precedes from their view as the Tucker Act, of the Tucker Act as constituting not only a grant of jurisdiction to the Court of Claims over particular types of cases, that is those involving claims from money damages, but also is creating substantive rights to money damages whenever the provisions of any Federal statute have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.738" offset="2114267">We submit that those are separate issues and that they must be analyzed separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.975" offset="2143211">An example, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, it is quite clear that Congress there waived a portion of the historic immunity of the United States to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.868" offset="2190754">It incorporated the Law of the Place and gave to private parties a substantive right to proceed against the United States for certain types of tortuous activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.042" offset="2235475">It did not, however, waive the immunity of the United States to suits in the Court to such suits in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.678" offset="2270061">Respondents' failure to appreciate the distinction between substantive rights and a grant of jurisdiction leads them to the a conclusion that would render meaningless, the multitude of federal statutes in which Congress has expressly created a right to money damages in particular and clearly defines circumstances in favor of private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.174" offset="2363998">Respondents' view would render the Back Pay Act, certainly superfluous as would it render a meaningless -- a number of other statutory provisions, for example, the provision in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, 42 U.S.C. 2000 (e) (5) (g) which --</text>

            <text syncTime="587.585" offset="2453650">Of course if you read, if you read the Wickersham case, Mr. Rupp, you wonder if the Back Pay Act was not superfluous?</text>

            <text syncTime="593.726" offset="2478205">Well, the Wickersham case, it is important to recognize I think that the context in which the Wickersham case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.761" offset="2522404">Prior to the passage of the Civil Service Act 1883, this Court held in several cases that federal employees who were discharged or not promoted stated no cause of action, were not entitled to judicial redress, notwithstanding the cause or reasons, the grounds for their suspension.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_p_rupp" startTime="628.439" stopTime="673.692">

            <text syncTime="628.439" offset="2617072">Keim and Hennan are the principal cases, I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.718" offset="2630133">With the passage of the Civil Service Act of 1883, which was measurably strengthened by the Lloyd-LaFollette Act in 1912, this Court, beginning with the United States versus Wickersham, and other Courts recognized that federal -- and that Congress intended that federal employees should not be separated from their position wrongfully, that they were entitled to the privileges and emoluments of the position to which they were appointed until they were wrongfully separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.585" offset="2741624">That is what those statutes meant, separation for cause and not otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.858" offset="2762731">At the same time, however, the Courts have continued to recognize that people are not entitled to receive the salary of the position to which they have never been appointed.</text>

            <text syncTime="673.692" offset="2798048">But really, all the Back Pay Act does is say if you are wrongfully denied your emoluments, you’re entitled to backpay, I would have thought -- I thought that was established by Wickersham?</text>

            <text syncTime="684.094" offset="2839635">Well, to some extent it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.243" offset="2844233">It certainly covered a -- some kinds of cases and maybe the kinds of cases that will arise in the majority kind of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.177" offset="2879968">Although the Back Pay Act extended protections to classes of employees who had not been there to -- for protected by judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.142" offset="2915913">If you look at the legislative history particularly of the Back Pay Act amendments passed in 1966, Congress thought it was filling in the gaps left by the Back Pay Act of 1948, which the legislative history indicated was tied to Section 7101 of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act and judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.058" offset="3003580">At the time they passed those amendments in 1966, they gave a rather careful consideration to the costs of the coverage that they were providing for.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.769" offset="3058437">Now, if the violation of any federal statute, including the Classification Act gave rise to a cause of action for backpay, it would have been a hold if you liked to pass the Back Pay Act or any number of other federal statutes such as the --</text>

            <text syncTime="930.902" offset="3826959">The principal point of my argument this morning was that it is inappropriate to imply authority to collect from the Public Treasury of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.173" offset="3875965">To complete that discussion let me only make a couple of additional points.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.492" offset="3893310">The first is that the principles that are discussed this morning do not govern Fifth Amendment taking cases in the citation by respondents and amici in this case to those cases appears to us consequently to have been misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.234" offset="3960288">The Fifth Amendment by its very terms is as this Court recognize in the Rail Reorganization Act Cases, a self executing waiver of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.495" offset="3997278">It would mean nothing if it did not meant that.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.408" offset="4008981">This Court has recognized that, beginning with the Cosby Case, and that view was reaffirmed in the Rail Reorganization Act Cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.388" offset="4040850">The Fifth Amendment is not implicated in this case and those cases do not govern here.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.924" offset="4059031">The second and the last point I would like to make in that regard is that neither is this a case like Bivens or Bell versus Hood where the immunity of the United States is not directly implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.073" offset="4111590">The issue in those cases, fundamentally, in those cases is fundamentally is whether the activities complained of the basis for the suit in those cases were Acts of the Sovereign with respect to which the defendants there were entitled to claim sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.487" offset="4177209">Although that issue may not be finally be disposed of, it seems relatively clear that if the person or a Federal employee is acting unconstitutionally or beyond the scope of his or her statutory authority, those allegations are not made here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.473" offset="4273235">This Court has so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.020" offset="4295387">The importance of the Court of Claims, to the Court of Claims assumption of jurisdiction in this case of its being able to imply a cause of action against the United States stems precisely from the fact that there is no federal statute expressly and unequivocally waiving or implying a substantive right in favor of individual federal employees to collect from the Public Treasury for the period of an assuredly wrongful Civil Service Classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.694" offset="4426104">Indeed the respondents in the amici had appeared to concede that there is no such substantive provision is explicitly so providing in the Classification Act, and in fact when the scheme provided for in the Classification Act, the classification process provided for in that Act is viewed as a whole, it seems to me apparent that Congress did not intend that classifications would operate either retroactively or that reclassification might provide a predicate for the recovery of backpay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.629" offset="4561836">For example, the Classification Acts provides in a number of provisions that the classification certificates issued by employing agencies in the first instance and on occasion in the event of review by the Civil Service Commission are to be binding on payroll, certifying and other officials with authority to disperse monies from the Public Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.380" offset="4648876">There is no provision in the Classification Act, warning either at retroactive reclassification or the award of backpay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.295" offset="4680537">Neither, I should note, is there any suggestion, however, tenuous in the legislative history of the Classification Act supporting the claim made by respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.133" offset="4735812">That omission it seems to me is particularly significant in light of the long standing rule that federal employees are entitled to receive only the salaries of the positions to which they were appointed, notwithstanding the fact that they may have performed duties of another higher paying position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.394" offset="4808850">Furthermore, although the Classification Act has been in effect for approximately 50 years, although significantly amended in 1948, but in its essential and effect for over 50 years, we have been able to locate only one of the case in which the Court of Claims or any other Court, we know of no other Court, that so held by implication as the Court of Claims did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.557" offset="4905503">The only other case in which the Court of Claims appeared to assume in dicta and again without reaching the issue that the Classification Act might provide a warrant for a retroactive reclassification or the award of backpays, the case Bookman (ph) versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.886" offset="4974884">Prior to the decision in Bookman, the Court of Claims had consistently and repeatedly held that federal employees were only entitled to the salaries of the positions to which they were appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.047" offset="5027547">They so held in cases such as Bear versus the United States, Price versus the United State and Coleman versus United States and as recently as 1968, none of those cases were cited or discussed in the Court’s opinion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.890" offset="5086897">In the series of decisions extending over 40 years, beginning shortly after passage of the Classification Act, the Comptroller General of the United States has taken the same position, that is that reclassifications may operate perspectively only and that federal employees may not recover back pay for the period of a wrongful classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.029" offset="5167459">The only exception to this general rule that has been recognized has been for administrative errors, attributable to the failure of the subordinate to implement a valid classification decision made by the employing agency or the Civil Service Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1288.185" offset="5256066">No, that may be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.416" offset="5276964">Although the Court of Claims in this case expressly disclaimed the erroneous on the Back Pay Act, let me make a couple points in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.595" offset="5313640">Again the Back Pay Act is not explicitly provided for the payment of money damages for the period of a wrongful classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.721" offset="5342166">The Back Pay Act authorizes the award of backpay and “to an employee subjected to an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction” of all or part of his compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.591" offset="5401725">That language does not cover the situation with which we have been presented here which does not involve the withdrawal or the reduction of compensation, but in assuredly wrongful failure to increase compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.070" offset="5451567">If there is any ambiguity in that language, and I think there is none, the legislative history of the Back Pay Act makes unmistakably clear that Congress meant that act to apply only to wrongful suspensions, demotions, removals and other unwarranted and unjustified personnel actions resulting from the reassignments or a transfer from full or part-time work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.986" offset="5563266">The Back Pay Act originally grew out of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act of 1912 which governed dismissals and suspensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.170" offset="5599942">As amended in 1966, the Congress filled in a number of gaps in the Act, but did not provide for the recovery of backpay for persons wrongfully classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.722" offset="5682176">The Court of Claims prior to this case has held as well that the Back Pay Act does not provide a predicate for the recovery by federal employees of backpay for the period of wrongful classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.005" offset="5739332">For it would have ruled otherwise other than it did in this case then it would have required to overrule a long line of its own decision, including Desmond versus United States, Dianish versus United States and Gaines versus the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.428" offset="5800981">Even if a substantive right to the recovery of money damages against the United States for the period of a wrongful classification could appropriately be found by implication and as I’ve argued this morning and in our briefs that it cannot be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.828" offset="5858659">I think that, we believe that the Court of Claims would no less assuredly have been without jurisdiction over this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.066" offset="5883528">We have discussed in some detail the history of the relationship between the federal government and its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.575" offset="5913621">In our briefs, we discussed it a bit further this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.895" offset="5938907">The fact is that when Congress was considering the Classification Act and the Back Pay Act, the prevailing rule was that wrongfully classified Civil Service employees were not entitled to the recovery of backpay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.919" offset="5998989">Congress could have provided in either the Classification Act or the Back Pay Act, for such recovery, it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.279" offset="6028455">It seems to me that it is persuasive evidence of Congress' intent not permit the recovery of backpay such as that sought by respondents in this case in the circumstances presented in their compliant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.087" offset="6099612">One final point on the jurisdictional or cause of action aspect of this case, that is the argument made by the amici that our position in this case would leave respondents wholly without remedy for wrongful classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.011" offset="6179338">As their discussion of the substantive provisions of the Classification Act reveals, I think, Congress created in the Classification Act an elaborate set of administrative safeguards to ensure that the goals of the Act would be met in practice, including the goal of equal pay for substantially equal work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.356" offset="6256765">We have also acknowledged that a suit could be brought in District Courts seeking perspective classification, although that remedy, the scope of that remedy is of course a limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.657" offset="6317892">To the extent that persons wrongfully classified or assuredly wrongfully classified are without backpay for the period of that wrongful classification is a matter in our view to be left to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.736" offset="6386228">They have resolved this far not to provide backpay under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.063" offset="6423531">With respect to the merits of the contention that the Civil Commission was arbitrary and capricious in refusing to compare respondents’ positions with the positions held by employees in another federal agency, let me say only that that kind of position to position comparison was very substantially the kind of classification scheme which Congress rejected in 1923 when it enacted the Classification Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.350" offset="6572742">They are inseparable in our view, practical difficulties associated with the suggestion that the Civil Service Commission has a duty to compare positions under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.228" offset="6620181">The Court of Claims attempted to deal with these difficulties in part by suggesting that its holding was limited to circumstances which the complaining employees and employees referred to, had a large nexus of duties performed in common.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.508" offset="6781304">The entire thrust of the Classification Act is to require the classification of positions by reference to generally applicable standards repeatedly in the Classification Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.710" offset="6818189">The Civil Service Commission is required to promulgate generally applicable standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.925" offset="6835012">Employing agencies are obligated to look at those classification standards in making classifications, in reviewing the appropriateness of classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.800" offset="6870538">The Civil Service Commission is required again to scrutinize the classification decisions reached by employing agencies in light of the General Classification Standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.141" offset="6927903">One of the great problems that would be presented with the Civil Service Commission to have a duty to perform comparisons of the type requested by respondents is that the employing agency in the first instance would not have access to the kind of information it would need to make such comparisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.810" offset="7014525">You would then have the decision made by -- a classification decision made by an employing agency not taking into account the full range of considerations made appropriate by the Court of Claims' decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.288" offset="7068442">Not only then would federal civil service employees have the prospect of to bite it said very largely the same apple, they would also have the prospect of review by a body obligated to take into account considerations that could not have been taken into account by the employing agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.558" offset="7141585">We believe that there is a very great likelihood that that would stimulate appeals in a large number of cases in which appeals were not warranted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.095" offset="8111668">Now, that provides that the Court of Claims who have jurisdiction to enter judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution or any act of Congress or any regulation of the Executive Department or upon any express or implying contract with the Unites States or for liquidated or un-liquidated damages in case it is not sounding in tort.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.946" offset="8303093">Four to three and Nichols joined, ruled this; they said that this case is peculiar in its facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.391" offset="8332873">Whereas here, employees all belong to a small betterly manageable category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.197" offset="8356070">Their jobs have a large nexus of duties shared in common and other employees were specifically pointed out by the complaining employees, we deem the case to be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.246" offset="8396298">Now, the case on which the Court of Claims depended was the Selman case, Selman against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.746" offset="8422316">In that case, Navy Captains had been assigned as Assistant Judge Advocate Generals of the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.697" offset="8446140">And the statute provided that if an officer was assigned to that position, he was entitled to the pay of rear admiral-lower half.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.848" offset="8482711">Nevertheless he was only paid at the rate of Navy Captain’s pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.858" offset="8502773">Now, when it came to the Court of Claims, the Court of Claims ruled that the statute was mandatory and gave them the pay of a rear admiral-lower half for the period of their service and gave Selman backpay for 44 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.265" offset="8564318">Now, this case, the plaintiffs are trial attorneys before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.217" offset="8592217">Now, the trial judge pointed out and he set forth the position, descriptions of both the plaintiffs which are under GS-13 and the Air Force Attorneys which are GS-14 and he said that there is really do difference between the position descriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.669" offset="8662016">The duties are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.653" offset="8665882">They prepare cases, try cases, file posturing briefs, file pre-trial briefs, interview witnesses, secure expert witnesses, they do everything, the same job is both of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.595" offset="8717709">Now, he said that if you apply the equal pay for equal work statute and if you look at the General Attorney series, you come to the inescapable conclusion that the plaintiffs are entitled to be classified at grade GS-14.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.372" offset="8784791">You have to make two jumps though to have the Selman case control this case, do you not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.819" offset="8806630">You have got that there is language in either the Back Pay Act or the Classification Act that is equally mandatory and you have got to show that Selman is right in the light of our decision in the King case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin J. McDermott</label>
            <text syncTime="2187.263" offset="8852396">Well, Selman is right because it was pursuant to a statute which provided for that pay, a pay of a rear admiral-lower half for an Assistant Judge Advocate General, it is a specific provision of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.188" offset="8912060">Now, we say that whereas Selman depended upon the provisions of a statute, we depend upon the provisions of the General Attorney Series and the trial judge and he studied this case, I think very well, he said this, “that the action of the comparison of the position descriptions at the DPSC and the AFLC demonstrate that they are strikingly similar” and he was of the opinion that one classifier, for instance, how that Dayton would look at the General Attorney Series of the position description and come to the conclusion and it was properly classified at grade GS-14.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.623" offset="9121771">Whereas the position classifier at the Defense Personnel Support Center will look at the same position description, the same General Attorney Series and come to the conclusion, that it was properly classified at GS-13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.439" offset="9169105">Now, he said the position descriptions are almost strikingly similar and the duties of the trial attorneys are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.239" offset="9200243">Now, also, Mr. Rupp argued that the Back Pay Act does not cover the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.867" offset="9234829">Now, in the amicus curiae brief, at page 16 on line 17, there is an analysis of the Back Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.623" offset="9269833">Now, it is submitted that the phrase unjustified or unwarranted personnel action within the meaning of the Back Pay Act applies as well to this action wrongly classifying the plaintiffs in this case as it would as if there were a removal or reduction in rank or a suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.274" offset="9356455">And he -- that is pointed out that the Congress left that phrase almost open for interpretation and that the Civil Service Commission did the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.264" offset="9400341">And that there is no statement in any of the Congressional hearings or reports defining what is meant by unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.728" offset="9438270">And that is merely a question of interpretation of the statute and we submit that, on that basis we are entitled to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.403" offset="9468886">Now, so far as jurisdiction is concerned, we depend on three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.838" offset="9490620">One, the General Attorney Series and the trial judge has found that we are entitled to grade GS-14 there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.404" offset="9520922">There are only two factors that are concerned there and that was and he went into them quite thoroughly in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.187" offset="9552060">Now, actually if you look at this case and you look at the Selman case, and in Selman, the Court said, that they were entitled to the rank of -- to the grade -- payable rear admiral-lower half because the statute so provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.073" offset="9627606">We say that we are entitled to the grade of GS-14 because the General Attorney Series so provided and the equal pay for equal work statute so provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.614" offset="9669715">Now actually, if you come down to the position of the Civil Service Commission, that says that we disregard the statute which says equal pay for equal work and we look at the position description of the person only under the series which is applicable to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.448" offset="9745052">Now, the Court of Claims and the trial judge ruled that that was improper and arbitrary and capricious because the Commission actually refused to follow a Congressional Mandate of equal pay for equal work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.108" offset="9799701">And there are many cases, recorded claims where that provision has been established and enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.078" offset="9823629">Now, we submit also that the trial judge found that there was discrimination in this case and he specifically found that out, found that in his opinion where he said on the evidence in this case he has concluded that the refusal to classify plaintiffs to GS-14 is arbitrary, discriminatory and is not supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.897" offset="9938881">Now, if there be discrimination in this case, then we cite the decision of the Court of Claims in Chambers against United States, and that ruled that a black applicant for a position in the Social Security Administration who had been discriminated against was entitled to backpay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.589" offset="10013696">Now, that is a very well written opinion by Judge Nichols and I suggest that if that opinion be followed and fact of discrimination be found to have been adopted by the trial judge as a finding, based upon his review of the record then I suggest that we are entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.728" offset="10102199">Now actually, if you look at what is referred to as the remand statute, all that the Court of Claims has done here has been to follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.805" offset="10218496">They found that the Civil Service Commission’s action was arbitrary and capricious and that the Commission should comply with the mandate of the statute calling for equal pay for equal work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.590" offset="10257679">And the Court of Claims ruled that the grades of other lawyers representing in other per curiam agencies before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals provide an essential benchmark and without consideration to them no confidence could be felt to the statute calling for equal pay for equal work has been obeyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.997" offset="10343257">Now the statute, that is 92-415, that is what is referred to in Mr. Rupp’s brief as the remand statute, provides that in any case within its jurisdiction the Court of Claims shall have the power to remand appropriate matters to any administrative or executive body or official with such direction as it may deem proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.621" offset="10425803">And the senate report pointed out that the Act provides the United States Court of Claims with the necessary means to compel administrative or executive bodies to take further action where it is necessary to make an adequate record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.392" offset="10472928">And that is all that the Court of Claims has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.045" offset="10483482">It said that that it disagrees with the trial judge that the Court has the right to reclassify people, but that is a job for the Civil Service Commission and it remanded it back to the Civil Service Commission to take into consideration, the equal pay for equal work statute and to find if the plaintiffs using as a benchmark the grade applied to the trial attorneys from the Air Force at Dayton to determine whether or not they were entitled to grade GS-14 and that is all that the remand statute does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.460" offset="10625170">So we ask the Court in consideration of this case to find first all that the Court of Claims had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.357" offset="10664772">To consider this, it is never necessary for a statute to itself provide that for a breach of it, a person shall have an action against United States because that is what the Tucker Act does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.479" offset="10725271">The Tucker Act gives jurisdiction to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.816" offset="10738541">And there are many statutes and regulations, the breach of which do not spell out the right to sue in the Court of Claims for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.775" offset="10774381">So we submit that there is -- first all there is jurisdiction and that it is a good thing for the practice of law generally to raise the grades of lawyers who appear before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.632" offset="10845852">Now, we have a letter from the chairman of the Armed services Board of Contract Appeals in which he says that generally most of the lawyers who appear before them are grade GS-14.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.217" offset="10896217">The only exception appears to be the trial attorneys for the Defense Personnel Support Center and when they do the same work that other lawyers do before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals then I submit that they are entitled to the same pay because it is equal work, equal pay for equal work and that is a statutory definition and reinstate and I submit that the Court of Claims’ judgment should be affirmed.</text>
