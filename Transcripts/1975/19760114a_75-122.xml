            <text syncTime="629.828" offset="2622615">In that case, the prosecuting attorney for Wayne County in 1937, asked the Michigan regulatory agency there, a successor to the regulatory agency which exists today, they asked them to investigate monopolistic practices and schemes engaged in by Detroit Edison and the Michigan Public Service Commission or at that time it was called “The Michigan Public Utilities Commission,” stated and I am quoting from the order of the MPSC there, “that it is without jurisdiction to investigate the acts, practices, devices and schemes under which the present rates were established in order to consider and report how such evils maybe remedied.”</text>

            <text syncTime="795.753" offset="3286334">They have a two-fold duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.626" offset="3293857">They have a duty to see that the rate is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.794" offset="3302530">They have got another duty to see that the investor in the company gets a fair rate of return.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.637" offset="3329906">They talk about conditions of services and those services refer basically to the transmission of this electric service.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.100" offset="3363761">In fact, Detroit Edison knows very well what it means by service.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.930" offset="3379017">It describes the term service in it is rate book which was attached to the defendant’s response in our motion -- in their motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.327" offset="3412662">And in four different places, they talked about character of service and each time they talk about it, they talk about it as alternating current service, primary high voltage service.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.581" offset="3453622">So, they are only talking when they discuss service here, the question of whether or not the rate was fair and that is the cost of electrical service.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.239" offset="3488313">Remember, you know it is difficult for me to able to express because the lamp or the light as such seems to be an integral part of this thing that we call light appear, but it really it is another commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.199" offset="3540140">It is a product like a refrigerator.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.684" offset="3550066">If that is not tied-in to the sale of refrigerators, it would be a more obvious situation here, but we do not have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.075" offset="3575666">We have a little innocuous thing called the lamp or light bulb.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.825" offset="3590608">This light bulb being a product is beyond the jurisdiction of Detroit -- of the Michigan Public Service Commission to regulate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.405" offset="3632927">The constitution in Michigan, I understand this goes back to years ago, when the farmers in the Upper Peninsula were complaining about the setting of range breaks down in lancing and they wanted to retain jurisdiction over the rate making process and the constitution says that the municipalities will reserve to themselves jurisdiction over the streets and alleys and that the Michigan Public Service Commission does not grant the monopoly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1397.196" offset="5692107">They have advertised this program as free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.464" offset="5701198">They have never submitted anything to Detroit -- to the Michigan Public Service Commission seeking approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.384" offset="5728888">In 1954, Detroit Edison on its own, again, without going back to the regulatory agency, stopped home delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.794" offset="5762533">There has been no regulation of the other bulbs that they sell when I address myself to page 275 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.350" offset="5796702">There is nothing here to indicate that the Michigan Public Service Commission investigated the competitive effect, the anti competitive effect of this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.109" offset="5839751">There is a survey made by an independent company in the appendix at page 290 and that tells you what the program is really all about on page 292 and what they have really tried to do here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.100" offset="5919686">Lamp renewal policy helps raise the wattage on lamps used, thus giving better lighting service to the public and resulting in lighting revenues to the Detroit Edison company, considerably above the average.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.750" offset="5982275">Now, this program has a lot of aspects to it to, the longer life aspect to it of the bulbs, also means that revenues of the Detroit Edison go up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.267" offset="6024385">Another aspect of the program and all of these facts which are more fully set out in the facts in our brief have never been subjected to the regulation of the Michigan Public Service Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.136" offset="6531892">The United states is here as amicus curiae in support of the petitioner because any rule announced in this case will heavily affect the government’s enforcement policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.334" offset="6568672">This relatively new field of Anti-Trust enforcement and it is that way because there has been modern proliferation of regulatory agencies, licensing agencies and so forth at the state and local levels which offer ever increasing opportunity for quite sophisticated businesses to get Anti-competitive policies immunized in some way by regulation or appear to be immunized in some way by the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.615" offset="6669818">And we think it is quite important to the Federal Anti-Trust policy that any immunity that it is granted be one that arises because there is a deliberate and affirmative regulatory policy of a state to command the activity which is questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.072" offset="6743588">And we think here that if the position or the doctrine espoused by Detroit Edison becomes the law, then the immunity of Parker against Brown will be expanded and will in fact shield anti competitive conduct that no state particularly wants and certainly that no state requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.817" offset="6822582">Now, I should make it clear that I express no opinion on the legality of the underlying conduct here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.912" offset="6846928">I do not know whether this is an illegal tie-in or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.938" offset="6855079">I do not think the record permits us to tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.352" offset="6864692">There is much play on both sides, by the petitioner and by the respondent, about whether or not this program is good for consumers, I frankly do not know and I do not think the question is before this Court at this time and so I intend not to address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.445" offset="6917146">Further more, I think the Noerr case which appears in the brief frequently is not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.654" offset="6933968">At least it is the government's position that any company may petition the state for any rule at once.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.702" offset="7046086">The question here is simply whether a Federal Court may even examine respondent’s practice in the light cast by the Anti-Trust laws and we think the answer to that is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.342" offset="7096659">We think the immunity doctrine was derived from Parker against Brown simply does not cover the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.725" offset="7118184">The status of the immunity depends upon two questions; one petitioner’s counsel has just discussed in part, which is the question of whether indeed there is a state agency acting with authority to act, the ultra virus question so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.645" offset="7173877">I shall not discuss that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.783" offset="7182445">I should like to discuss the question of whether the conduct here was compelled by any affirmative policy of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2255.734" offset="9126269">There the Court said that a private party might force retailers to maintain prices and provided the procedures if they elected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.331" offset="9384672">I think it essentially involves in affirmative state policy or involvement under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.968" offset="9411213">It involves affirmative state policy under Parker, but I think it is somewhat perhaps -- I do not think it is necessary for this Court to decide which is broader, but it seems to me that it can hardly be argued plausibly that the anti-trust concept of state action is broader than the Fourteenth Amendment concept and unless that is true than I think Jackson against Metropolitan Edison really disposes of this case by analogy if you wish to have said that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="2480.869" offset="10026762">With the exception of the treble damages which the petitioner seeks here, all the relief that he seeks otherwise is available to him from the Michigan Public Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.804" offset="10062497">He conceded during his oral argue to be for Judge Fiekens that it may will be theoretically, at least the Michigan Public Service Commission can tell Detroit Edison to avoid including the cost of light bulbs in its rate pay, based for purposes of determining its rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.810" offset="10114533">When Judge Fiekens asked him whether they have tried to invoke the procedures at Michigan Public Service Commission, he admitted that it was a crucial question as to whether or not the lamp exchange program came within the jurisdiction, but he conceded that he have not approached the Commission at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.811" offset="10166569">It seems to us that Judge Fiekens was reasonably -- was correct in his opinion when he said that certainly the anti-trust court should not step in when the Commission has not even and approached by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.373" offset="10208783">Now, the petitioner and the Department of Justice both seem to us to be operating under what we believe are misconceptions of both fact and law and the way the regulatory process works in the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.211" offset="10248176">The Commission's most recent order to Detroit Edison, involving the lamp supply program is in case (U) 45 7D which is dated February 3, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.160" offset="10287986">The opinion and or of the Commission begins with the language, “therefore it is ordered that,” it goes on to say in sub-paragraph D, “in conformance with Commission Order number D3096 filing procedures, the Detroit Edison Company shall promptly file with the Commission, rate schedules substantially same as those attached hereto as exhibit A.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.725" offset="10366249">The exhibit A which is referred to in the order, includes the lamp supply program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.828" offset="10386625">It contains the following language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.342" offset="10396656">Incandescent lamps will be furnished without extra charge (1) to residences connected for the first time to the company’s lines and such quantities maybe needed for all permanent fixtures, (2) as replacements of approved burned out lamps in proportion to the use of energy for lighting purposes under the applicable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.689" offset="10474083">The Commission then went on to say “the Commission specifically reserves jurisdiction of the matters herein contained and the authority to issue to such further order or orders as the facts and circumstances require.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3001.658" offset="12109975">At the time it was unavailable to large commercial customers and Detroit Edison wanted to reduce its cost, so it could reduce its rates and it did go into the Commission and it asked for permission to eliminate the lamp supply program to large commercial customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.092" offset="12167653">The Public Service Commission did permit that and said that “lamp replacements of approved burnt out incandescent lamps will continue to be furnished under its general service rate which applied to small business” and it also require it to continue to furnish lamps under the exchange program to residential customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.381" offset="12240796">So not only did they consider the lamp supply program in 1964, but it exercise the discriminatory judgment as to which parts the program would continue and which parts it would be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.426" offset="12289070">And in 1964, it is said, “it is further ordered that Detroit Edison shall promptly file rate sheets to be effective on service or rendered after December 1, 1964” and that included the residential lamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.291" offset="12340479">And at that time they reserved jurisdiction of the matter and the authority issued further orders and the order says maybe required and the order is signed by each of the commissioners and under date of November 12, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.800" offset="12390530">There are have been 18 orders of the Michigan Public Service Commission and its predecessors to Detroit Edison since 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.498" offset="12417279">The Michigan Public Service Commission and its predecessors, well, state regulation of the utilities begin in Michigan in 1909 and till 1916, Detroit Edison has been at all times under an affirmative order to continue the lamp supply program.</text>

            <text syncTime="3103.880" offset="12518844">Well, the reason for that, it seems to be that no one has ever asked for such a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.174" offset="12535980">We do not know of any complaints which have made been made to the Michigan Public Service Commission about the lamp supply program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.681" offset="12558027">I would not say that someone may not have written letter, there may not have been complaints, but we do not know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.208" offset="12576104">There has been a case filed in the State Court in Michigan which the petitioner refers to on its brief, it is the Rio (ph) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.526" offset="12601390">It was filed in 1973 and it seeks an injunction against the continuation of the lamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.633" offset="12621870">We have not mentioned it in our brief for which I apologize, but I learned over the recess that the Court of Appeals -- that the Circuit Court in Michigan has decided that case and they dismissed it in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.675" offset="12665965">That is an unreported opinion and I did not know about it and I would like permission to furnish a copy to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.210" offset="12688117">It decided the case, dismissed the case on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter because the Michigan Public Service Commission had jurisdiction over the lamp supply program and that the petitioner or the plaintiff in that case had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before coming into even the State Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.669" offset="12761991">We think that these are state law questions that the jurisdiction of the Michigan Public Service Commission should, in the first place, if the petitioner thinks that they do not have jurisdiction, he should argue it to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.694" offset="12806086">If he disagrees with the conclusion that they reached, he has available appeal procedures to the Circuit Courts in Michigan and if he disagrees the lamp, he can go to the Michigan Supreme Court, but he has not done any those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.957" offset="12851121">He simply gone into the anti Trust Court and tried to get the Federal Courts to decide what are, I would conceded at least a realistic and a significant questions of state laws as to extent of jurisdiction to the Public Service Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3351.315" offset="13508571">Their typical practice is to send four or five men into the company for a period of four or five weeks.</text>

            <text syncTime="3364.055" offset="13559562">The cost of the lamp supply program is specifically included in an account as it is required to be under the Michigan Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.577" offset="13597596">The Michigan administrative code requires these costs to be included in customer installation expense which is where they are included.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.772" offset="13630406">This is also consistent with the treatment which the Federal Power Commission requires and has required since 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.299" offset="13660499">So that there is not any mystery about the fact that there has been a lamp supply program which Detroit Edison has had in effect since 1885.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.794" offset="13694458">Now, my friend on the other side has said that the lamp supply program has made Detroit Edison a best loved utility in the country and if that is the result of lamp program which I understood as what he was saying, it seems to me that certainly demonstrates the wide spread use and knowledge of the existence of the lamp supply program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.109" offset="13783797">We had a survey conducted some years ago which indicated that 94% of our customers used the lamp supply program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.644" offset="13817861">We -- there are about million and a half house holds in the Detroit Edison’s service area which get service from the Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.402" offset="13844924">Now, if 94% of them used the lamp supply program, it is hardly any secret and we have not kept it a secret and in fact, the exhibit which the petitioner’s counsel referred to in the appendix which shows the availability of the different size of light bulbs, demonstrates that this program is well publicized.</text>

            <text syncTime="3839.188" offset="15460022">Another reason why we are able to furnish light bulbs at this cost is because Detroit Edison gets competitive bids from the light bulb manufactures.</text>

            <text syncTime="4319.996" offset="17383262">Michigan has an Anti-Trust law, so the Anti-Trust laws in competition or the state policy of Michigan just as there the national policy of the United states under Federal Anti-Trust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.004" offset="17419310">So that as in gulf states' utilities, the public utility can be the first line of defense against anti competitive practices which may later turn out to be anti-trust violations, so that the petitioner has a form before the Michigan Public Service Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="4396.036" offset="17687431">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.160" offset="17703941">I represent a group of Michigan utilities who locally could not care less about light bulbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.056" offset="17727555">They some of the electric companies that do not have this provision, others are gas and telephone Companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.220" offset="17748244">Our concern is not what this particular tariff or the provisions, merits, public interest anti-competitive or otherwise features of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.331" offset="17780636">Our interest is in the position taken by the petitioners and the Solicitor General which would make life absolutely impossible for a utility to operate and would be grossly unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.379" offset="17820865">Now, let me use as an illustration the point that just been discussed by Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.266" offset="17844375">I do not think it makes the slightest difference, whether utility proposes this tariff, whether the chairman of the Commission drafts it or the speaker of the house drafts it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.713" offset="17890142">The point is no matter who submitted this tariff if the utility has not had the option.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.129" offset="17911875">If Detroit Edison files a tariff with this lamp provision in it, the Commission can take it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.010" offset="17935386">If the utility files a tariff with the provision out, the Michigan can put it back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.631" offset="17957851">The authority for that is under the pervasive regulatory statute which is common in the public utility regulatory matters wherein addition to fixing rates the Commission made by order also establish such rules and conditions of service as shall be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.047" offset="18019500">You are absolutely right Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="4480.813" offset="18026605">There are hundreds of these conditions and service and these tariffs just bristle with problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.743" offset="18046249">Who puts the meter where and who takes the pipe how far in and who pays how much to get a cable put in a subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.715" offset="18074148">These are just full of problems and any bristle with anti-trust problems and this is just one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.092" offset="18099644">My point is that under this pervasive regulation, it does not matter who wrote the first draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.321" offset="18116571">The important thing is that the Michigan Commission is the one who decides it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.329" offset="18132662">Now, it is more toward the mat and this is critical and that something I hope I can emphasize enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.392" offset="18160875">The standards are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.940" offset="18171115">Under Parker v. Brown you cannot just say, let us forget the competition, there has to be a state that competition is displaced, eliminated or subordinated and that is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.283" offset="18220434">You also have to substitute machinery by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.780" offset="18238406">The state imposes its views of what the proper decision is under the other standard and the utility feel we call the Public Interest Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.043" offset="18271529">Now, in Michigan, the Michigan Supreme Court said in a case affirmed here in 1951, that the right to exclude competition where the general public convenience and necessities so require has been delegated by the legislature to the Michigan Public Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.561" offset="18345508">The standard is not the same as the standard under the Anti-Trust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="4642.207" offset="18672143">Now, that is the critical distinction here because there has been a different standard and a machinery for enforcing that standard substituted for competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.991" offset="18715297">Substituted for competition and that is what this public utility regulation is all about and the Solicitor General speaks of a trend.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.790" offset="18746435">He says there is be a trend here where, as he would put it, some people are starting to use mechanism of the states to frustrate national policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.036" offset="18779454">Now, as I have read, the national policy is not, and I emphasize not, to impose competition as part of the Standard Regulating Public Utilities, it is simply not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.729" offset="18822190">And the Federal Power Act, the Federal Communications Act, the Natural Gas Act, all use a public inter standard and most importantly here leave to the states, leave to the states as to this local distribution matters like Detroit Edison, the question of their regulations under their public interest standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.978" offset="18887183">Now, if you go to the Federal Anti-Trust Court and that is what these all about, whether you are going to have a hearing on whether these light bulbs last long and whether they are good or bad or indifferent, you are going to have a hearing in Anti-Trust Court, that is what these people want and may be that the petitioner wants treble damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.068" offset="18943608">What the Solicitor General wants is to take over into Anti-Trust Courts, the imposition of Federal Anti-Trust Standards and he says he does not preempt, but he preempts in practical effect by imposing Federal Anti-Trust Standards through the Federal Courts on the states.</text>
