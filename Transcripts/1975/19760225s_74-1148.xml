            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73676">The second case, Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. versus Cottrell, Health Officer of Mississippi is here from a three-judge District Court with the Southern District of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.255" offset="130623">A Mississippi regulation provides that milk and milk products from another state maybe sold in Mississippi only if the other state accepts the milk or milk products produced and processed in Mississippi on a reciprocal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.586" offset="207945">And appellant A&amp;P's application for a permit to distribute for sale at it's retail outlets in Mississippi, milk and milk products from it's Louisiana processing plant was denied by Mississippi, solely on the ground that Louisiana had not signed a reciprocity agreement with Mississippi as required by the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.145" offset="314212">A&amp;P then brought suit claiming that the regulation violated the Commerce Clause, but the three-judge district court upheld the regulation as a valid exercise of state police powers, even though incidentally burdening Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.151" offset="382234">We reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.622" offset="388086">We hold that the mandatory character or the regulations reciprocity requirement unduly burdens the free flow of Interstate Commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause and cannot be justified as a permissible exercise of the state power.</text>
