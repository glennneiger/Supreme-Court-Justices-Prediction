            <text syncTime="16.930" offset="141398">Now the first of these cases comes to us from the Court of Civil Appeal in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.995" offset="165640">Under the Texas law when a domestic corporation challenges the venue of a seat brought against it, the plaintiff amongst other things has to prove by a preponderance of the evidence and he has a cause of action against the domestic corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.811" offset="236902">Where a foreign corporation is sued and challenges the venue of action against it, a similar requirement is not made by Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.997" offset="285594">And this difference between the situations of the domestic and foreign corporations was challenged as a denial of equal protection and violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.821" offset="332928">The Court of Civil Appeals of Texas rejected as without merit that equal protection claim, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.011" offset="377650">Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Mr. Justice Rehnquist joins.</text>
