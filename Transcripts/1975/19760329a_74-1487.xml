            <text syncTime="48.119" offset="295839">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.977" offset="311199">The issue in this case is whether an indigent prisoner, who did not appeal his conviction, has, under the constitution, an unconditional right to obtain a transcript of his trial for perusal in the hope that the transcript will disclose errors, the nature of which he does yet know.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.667" offset="386014">Put another way, the question is whether Congress overstepped its constitutional powers, when it required indigent prisoners to show that they had some need of a transcript to support a non-frivolous claim for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.318" offset="444633">The facts of this case are not complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.125" offset="455813">Respondent was convicted in 1970 of uttering forged currency, and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.881" offset="486847">He did not appeal that conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.647" offset="497922">Counsel for respondent has represented that the reason he did not appeal was in order to avail himself of a more prompt motion in the District Court for reduction of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.851" offset="538673">The District Court denied that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.967" offset="551212">In March 1972, respondent filed pro se a motion for transcript in forma pauperis.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.119" offset="587784">The Chief Judge of the District Court instructed the clerk of the court to return that motion to respondent, instructing him that he should file instead, a motion for collateral relief, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2255. In June of 1972, respondent filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief, which the District Court allowed to be filed as a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.494" offset="685273">This complaint alleged that respondent desired collateral relief, that he believed that his counsel at trial had been inadequate, and that he believed that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.053" offset="735532">The complaint also alleged that respondent's memory and trial notes were inadequate and that without a transcript, he would be unable to frame his arguments for fair and effective relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.851" offset="786732">Did the District Court consider this underlying pleading as one filed under 2255 of Title 28?</text>

            <text syncTime="181.938" offset="831036">It dismissed it for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.597" offset="849740">We believe that the best interpretation of this is that it considered it as complaint under 2255 and the request for a transcript is ancillary to that complaint and then dismissed it accordingly.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.098" offset="1155686">The stenographic minutes are still available, although they have not been transcribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.212" offset="1180136">The prayer for relief asked the District Court to declare that respondent has “an absolute constitutional right” to a verbatim transcript of his criminal trial, supplied at government expense to aid him in preparing a motion for collateral relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.017" offset="1251398">The complaint is in essence, simply an assertion of respondent’s good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.735" offset="1270207">It asserts that respondent believes that his trial notes are inadequate, and that he believes that he is entitled to relief, but it sets forth none of the grounds upon which those beliefs are based.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.198" offset="1320153">The District Court appointed counsel for respondent in order to investigate the claims because the files and records of the case did not fully disclose whether he was entitled to the transcript he sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.227" offset="1364247">The investigation, with the aid of counsel, disclosed no grounds upon which a transcript was needed, other than as respondent’s counsel candidly admitted to the Court of Appeals, to peruse in the hope that some error, the nature of which could not yet be determined, might show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.334" offset="1436659">The District Court ultimately dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.999" offset="1451287">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a transcript must be provided upon request to search for error.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.327" offset="1480649">We believe that the starting point for an inquiry into an indigent’s right to a trail transcript is 28 U.S.C. 753 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="352.572" offset="1513563">That Section provides that a trial transcript can be furnished, without charge to an indigent prisoner, proceeding in a motion for collateral relief, under Section 2255, and I quote “If the Trial Judge or a Circuit Judge certifies that the suit or appeal is not frivolous, and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented.”</text>
            <text syncTime="375.828" offset="1606664">In other words, an indigent prisoner, far from being cut-off on account of poverty, from evidence that may be important to some collateral claims, is entitled by statute, to a trial transcript, if he can show first that the transcript is necessary to support certain factual allegations and second, those allegations, if proved by the transcript, would amount to a non-frivolous claim for collateral relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.914" offset="1718990">There can be no doubt that the Congress meant to impose upon applicants the burden of demonstrating need and lack of frivolity.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.095" offset="1747725">The Court of Appeals so held, and that portion of its opinion is reproduced at pages 8A to 10A of our petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.738" offset="1778236">The legislative history of Section 753 (f) shows that it was amended in 1965 to extend to proceedings under Section 2255, the same right to a transcript without cost, that previously had been available in habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.222" offset="1840198">The 1965 Amendment adopted verbatim, a 1961 proposal of the judicial conference, and that proposal was drafted to incorporate the almost universal rule of both state and federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.644" offset="1897877">A rule that had prevailed in collateral cases until the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.951" offset="1923163">A rule that a prisoner must show more than a subjective desire for a transcript in a collateral proceeding in order to be entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.810" offset="1958585">We believe that this legislative history and the almost universal rule in habeas corpus proceedings also disposes of respondent’s argument at Section 753 (f) as worded and as construed by the Court of Appeals, suspends the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.781" offset="2022429">Far from suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.816" offset="2034549">Section 753 (f) makes access to a transcript identical, under both habeas corpus and under Section 2255, there is no suspension.</text>

            <text syncTime="526.951" offset="2211137">Section 753 (f), we think, does no more than enacting to law, the observations of this Court in many of the cases, beginning in 1956 in Griffin against California, agianst Illinois, excuse me, dealing with a right to a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.135" offset="2279891">This Court has observed many times that a transcript is not necessary in every case and that in many cases, less than all of the transcript will suffice and the legislature can take steps to effect those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.236" offset="2336211">Section 753 (f) is such a step.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.107" offset="2351780">The question here, therefore, is whether the device Congress has chosen is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.042" offset="2375500">The burden of my argument is that Congress has provided indigents with multiple opportunities to review their criminal convictions, and multiple opportunities to obtain a transcript that would facilitate such review.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.768" offset="2426386">Congress, therefore, has not cut-off review on account of a person’s poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.205" offset="2444149">It has simply structured and confined the methods by which such review can be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.879" offset="2466824">Congress has provided the fair opportunity for review that this Court has held is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.335" offset="2492633">It is true of course, that the provisions of 753 (f), requiring an indigent person to show need and lack of frivolity, do not apply to a person who can pay for his own transcript and in that sense, the destitute and the wealthy are not treated identically.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.992" offset="2563268">The Court of Appeals thought this to be fatal, but this Court has held that absolute equality is not required, and the fact that a particular tool might be of use to some defendants and applicants for collateral relief, it does not mean that the constitution requires its provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.820" offset="2630559">The constitution requires a practical opportunity for effective review, and we believe that Congress has provided that opportunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3426.380" offset="13808878">That is right and this Court had not been confronted with a position prior to the Fourteenth Amendment's enactment of whether the habeas corpus right would have to implemented directly by the states and prior to the time that could have confronted under the Fourteenth Amendment as a right made applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.272" offset="13876378">The problem has been resolved by the legislation to which you referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.485" offset="13917233">The position that the government takes with regards to the Equal Protection issue raised by a respondent below, I believe misstates the position which both the Ninth Circuit adopted in its opinion and that asserted to here by a respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.809" offset="13978569">Specifically, the Equal Protection position taken is not that the wealthy person’s standards are to be met by the state or the federal government in aiding indigent prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.558" offset="14021514">Quite the contrary, the issue is one of adequate access, and the language which the lower court relied upon, which I submit is appropriate and meets MacCOLLOM’s requirements in this case, is a language of this Court in Ross v. Moffitt, specifically, that the duty of the system is to assure the individual, the indigent defendant, an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly, and at least where Sixth Amendment claims and the Fifth Amendment claims as asserted by MacCOLLOM or raised, that required transcript in the post-conviction relief context of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.776" offset="14162471">I do not believe that the government can assert to the contrary that the language we relied upon below is any different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.785" offset="14194445">That is the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.678" offset="14197998">It is the standard used by this Court in Equal Protection cases in right to transcript and right to counsel, and that is, I believe, the only standard adopted by the lower court decision.</text>
