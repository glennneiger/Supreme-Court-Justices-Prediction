            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73658">The judgments and opinion of the Court in 75-62, Runyon against McCrary and three related cases will be announced by Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="13.729" stopTime="846.721">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="13.729" offset="128515">These cases are here by the reason of the grant of writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.158" offset="166236">The principal issue presented by these consolidated cases is whether a federal law, namely Section 1981 of Volume 42 of the United States Code, prohibits commercially operated private schools from excluding qualified children solely because they are Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.288" offset="258709">That law in pertinent part reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.713" offset="276473">“All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens.”</text>
            <text syncTime="65.816" offset="336868">The respondents in number 75-62, Michael McCrary and Colin Gonzales are Negro children.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.599" offset="371976">By their parents, they filed a class action against the petitioners in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.585" offset="391934">Russell and Katheryne Runyon, who are the proprietors of Bobbe's private School in Arlington, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.810" offset="420878">Their complaint alleged that they had been prevented from attending the school because of the petitioners' policy of denying admission to Negroes, in violation of Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.796" offset="468838">They sought declaratory and injunctive relief and monetary damages. On the same day, Colin Gonzales, the respondent in No. 75-66, filed a similar complaint by his parents against the petitioner in that case, Fairfax-Brewster School located in Fairfax County, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.731" offset="556505">The petitioner in No. 75-278, the Southern Independent School Association, sought and was granted permission to intervene as a party defendant in the suit against the Runyons.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.305" offset="606869">That organization is a nonprofit association, composed of six state private school associations, and represents 395 private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.307" offset="658801">It is stipulated that many of these schools deny admission to Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.924" offset="681266">The suits were consolidated for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.030" offset="693700">The findings of the District Court, which were left undisturbed by the Court of Appeals, were as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.151" offset="722226">Bobbe's School opened in 1958 and grew from an initial enrollment of five students to 200 students in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.737" offset="764545">A day camp was begun in 1967 and has averaged 100 children per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.251" offset="790562">The Fairfax-Brewster School commenced operations in 1955 and opened a summer day camp in 1956. A total of 223 students were enrolled at the school during the 1972-1973 academic year, and 236 attended the day camp in the summer of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.835" offset="876976">Neither school has ever accepted a Negro child for any of its programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.150" offset="902158">In response to a mailed brochure addressed "resident" and an advertisement in the "Yellow Pages" of the telephone directory, Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales telephoned and then visited the Fairfax-Brewster School in May of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.811" offset="964851">After the visit, they submitted an application for their son Colin's admission to the day camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.329" offset="990974">The school responded with a formal letter, which stated that the school was "unable to accommodate Colin's application."</text>
            <text syncTime="236.734" offset="1020545">Mr. Gonzales telephoned the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.380" offset="1031098">Fairfax-Brewster's Chairman of the Board explained that the reason for Colin's rejection was that the school was not integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.595" offset="1059937">Mr. Gonzales then telephoned Bobbe's School, from which the family had also received in the mail a brochure addressed simply to “resident.”</text>
            <text syncTime="255.992" offset="1097554">In response to a question concerning that school's admissions policies, he was told that only members of the Caucasian race were accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.585" offset="1135901">In August of 1972, Mrs. McCrary telephoned Bobbe's School in response to an advertisement in the telephone book.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.209" offset="1166412">She inquired about nursery school facilities for her son, Michael.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.176" offset="1182295">She also asked if the school was integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.270" offset="1194729">The answer was no.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.449" offset="1207372">Upon these facts, the District Court found that the Fairfax-Brewster School had rejected Colin Gonzales' application on account of his race and that Bobbe's School had denied both children admission on racial grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.144" offset="1266200">The court held that Section 1981 makes illegal, the schools' racially discriminatory admissions policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.784" offset="1300786">It therefore enjoined Fairfax-Brewster School and Bobbe's School and the member schools of the Southern Independent School Association from discriminating against applicants for admission on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.169" offset="1354285">The court awarded compensatory relief to Mr. and Mrs. McCrary, Michael McCrary, and Colin Gonzales, but the court held that the damages claim of Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales was barred by Virginia's two-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions, "borrowed" for Section 1981 suits filed in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.653" offset="1436205">Finally, the court assessed attorneys' fees for $1,000 against each of the two schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.283" offset="1466716">The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed the District Court's grant of equitable and compensatory relief and its ruling as to the applicable statute of limitations, but reversed its award of attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.551" offset="1531813">We granted the petitions for certiorari filed by the Fairfax-Brewster School and that's case number 75-66; Bobbe's School in number 75-62; and the Southern Independent School Association number 75-278, to consider whether Section 1981 prevents private schools of this kind from discriminating racially among applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.330" offset="1634945">We also granted the cross-petition of Michael McCrary, Colin Gonzales, and their parents, in number 75-306 to determine the attorneys' fees and statute of limitations issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.469" offset="1695444">It is perhaps worth noting that some of the questions that these cases do not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.023" offset="1721671">They do not present any question of the right of a private social organization to limit its membership on racial grounds or any other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.572" offset="1763885">They do not present any question of the right of a private school to limit its student body to boys, to girls, or to adherence of a particular religious faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.147" offset="1818220">They do not even present the application of Section 1981 to private sectarian schools that practice racial exclusion on religious grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.842" offset="1864927">Rather, these cases present only two basic questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.914" offset="1881227">Whether Section 1981 prohibits private, commercially operated, nonsectarian schools from denying admission to prospective students solely because they are Negroes, and, if so, whether that federal law is constitutional as so applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.653" offset="1964192">It is now well established that Section 1981 enacted under the power conferred upon Congress by Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment, prohibits racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of private contracts and we think it is apparent that the racial exclusion practiced by the Fairfax-Brewster School and Bobbe's Private School amounts to a classic violation of Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.584" offset="2103895">The parents of Colin Gonzales and Michael McCrary sought to enter into contractual relationships with Bobbe's School for educational services.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.109" offset="2146004">Colin Gonzales' parents sought to enter into a similar relationship with the Fairfax-Brewster School.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.114" offset="2174112">Under these contractual relationships, the schools would have received payments for services rendered, and the prospective students would have received instruction in return for those payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.972" offset="2221446">The educational services of Bobbe's Private School and the Fairfax-Brewster School were advertised and offered to members of the general public,but neither school offered services on an equal basis to white and nonwhite students.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.000" offset="2285602">As the Court of Appeals held, "there is ample evidence in the record to support the trial judge's factual determinations that Colin Gonzales and Michael McCrary were denied admission to the schools because of their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.146" offset="2346207">"The Court of Appeals' conclusion that Section 1981 was thereby violated follows, we think inexorably, from the language of that statute, as construed in our previous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.922" offset="2409318">The question remains whether Section 1981 as applied, violates constitutionally protected rights of free association and privacy, or a parent's right to direct the education of his children.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.909" offset="2473266">In a series of decisions, the Court has recognized a First Amendment right to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.535" offset="2511718">From this principle it may be assumed that parents have a First Amendment right to send their children to educational institutions that promote the belief that racial segregation is desirable, and that the children have an equal right to attend such institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.810" offset="2580891">But it does not follow that the practice of excluding racial minorities from such institutions is also protected by the same principle and as the Court of Appeals noted, "there is no showing that discontinuance of the discriminatory admission practices would inhibit in any way the teaching in these schools of any ideas or dogma.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.124" offset="2678066">"In Meyer against Nebraska, good many years ago, the Court held that the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, includes the right to send one's children to a private school that offers specialized training, in that case, instruction in the German language and that doctrine was expanded in the later case of Pierce against Society of Sisters and much more recent case of Wisconsin against Yoder.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.113" offset="2810037">It is clear that the present application of Section 1981 infringes no such constitutional right as was recognized in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.548" offset="2851833">No challenge is made to the petitioner's right to operate their private schools or the right of parents to send their children to a particular private school rather than to a public school nor do these cases involve a challenge to the subject matter which is taught at any private school.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.830" offset="2916930">Thus, the Fairfax-Brewster School and Bobbe's Private School and members of the intervenor association remain free to inculcate whatever values and standards they think desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.040" offset="2973772">The Court has held that in some situations the Constitution confers a right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.468" offset="2999477">While the application of Section 1981to the conduct at issue here does not represent governmental intrusion into the privacy of the home or a similarly intimate setting, it does implicate parental interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.400" offset="3063216">These interests are related to in a cogent kind of way to the to the pro-creative rights protected in such cases as Roe against Wade and Griswold against Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.283" offset="3110758">But the court has repeatedly stressed that while parents do have a constitutional right to send their children to private schools and a constitutional right to select private schools that offer specialized instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.078" offset="3161958">They have no constitutional right to provide their children with private school education unfettered by reasonable government regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.039" offset="3201769">For these and other reasons, spelled out in some detail in the court's written opinion, we agree with the Court of Appeals that enforcement of Section 1981 in these cases will not work a deprivation of any constitutional right of the defendant schools, of the intervenors or of their pupils or patrons.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.110" offset="3286092">For the reasons stated in the Court's written opinion, we also agree with the Court of Appeals disposition of the subsidiary issues involving the statute of limitations and the award of attorney fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.723" offset="3348473">For the reasons I have summarized which are elaborated at considerable length in the Court's written opinion filed with the clerk today, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is in all respects affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.541" offset="3407718">Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Stevens while joining the court's opinion have each filed concurring opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.606" offset="3436035">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion in which he has been joined by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
