            <label>Mr. Burton Marks</label>
            <text syncTime="496.191" offset="2088040">Well, the return would not be admissible because it would not have any evidentially value I assume or based on other ground that I forget the case, you could not use the person’s assertion of the privilege against him as an inference of guilt which is a different subject altogether, but I perceive in our case and this is why a very interesting proposition, in Sullivan, this Court said many years ago, you cannot take the privilege against the whole tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.764" offset="2242372">In Marchetti where the Court said and I use certain quotes; “where there is an area permeated with criminal statutes where it is obviously incriminating, then the person can assert the Fifth Amendment privilege at the earliest opportunity, I mean, at the opportunity where it is being prosecuted to -- at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.063" offset="2331606">That was the specific holding of Marchetti, no question about it, asserted at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.750" offset="2354280">Now, here we have an intermediate situation, but I submit that it is really no different.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.858" offset="2382701">Garner is no different from Marchetti because the unconstitutionality of the statute, if you please or the unconstitutionality, the permeation of criminal, criminality comes not from the face of the statute which is fair, but either from its application by the government which admittedly uses tax returns for any purpose at once in a tax case or a non-tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.354" offset="2520732">In the appendix and in the government regulations, the Internal Revenue is 26 CFR which is cited in the quote, that is all the government attorney has to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.634" offset="2561797">The youngest U.S. Attorney, Assistant US Attorney has to do is write a letter to the department -- the Internal Revenue Service and say, I want a copy of the -- of the tax return of Mr. Garner and it is necessary, that is the only word he has to use, it is necessary for my investigation and he gets it.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.952" offset="2651136">Now, the proposition is that the government and the government says in their brief, if you deprive us of our right to go into a person’s confidential tax returns, you are hampering government investigation and what it means simply is that the minute Mr. Garner becomes a subject of investigation according to the governor's -- government’s theory, he becomes a suspect for any type of criminal activity and he is fair game for complete government investigation and complete going into his tax returns, and therefore, the government, by writing a letter can circumvent the Fourth Amendment and the requirements of Boyd versus the U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.109" offset="2839740">They send the letter and they say, we want the income tax return then they have the income tax return and under Calandra just recently decided, throw it into the Grand Jury and the Grand Jury has this information that they can use.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.410" offset="2912987">Mr. Garner cannot object.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.416" offset="2925003">How does -- why does not the government have to show probable cause to get a copy of Mr. Garner’s tax return and if he does need probable cause, then are not the regulations promulgated by the government equally unconstitutional on their face, that is to say, they do not -- they -- they are not in compliance with the Fourth Amendment and the government attorney in this case should never have been permitted to get the tax returns in the first place in a non-tax related case.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.966" offset="3055198">And there is where the evil comes and that is why this is a type case not a Sullivan case and that is the reason why Mr. Garner can only object at the time when he is faced with the evidence which was presented against him at trial because he never had a chance to object to the use of the evidence before.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.152" offset="3135968">He would never know that the government, the U.S. Attorney, the FBI and if you read the -- the regulations of the treasury, you would be astounded that how many people have access to your tax returns and if you recall, Mr. Garner testified and that is also in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.121" offset="3219769">He got up in his defense and that is the only testimony he gave, he thought his tax returns were confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.083" offset="3247668">And I would wager that if you -- you took a prior to some of the publicity that has been coming out in recent months, but if you had taken a poll sometime before of the citizenry of this country, they would have assumed that they had a sort of a pack with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.380" offset="3312870">If they report truthfully and honestly what -- what they have done, the government is going to withhold that information and it is confidential and nobody else has a right to see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.210" offset="3368145">If they defraud the government in their tax return then that is their problem. Then the government has a right to go to the tax returns to detect the fraud, but otherwise, they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.535" offset="3417464">Now, it seems to me that when you get this type of government activity which turns a -- an innocent tax return fair on its face into the subject of constant investigation, in other words, the -- the person investigated, whether or not he has been accused or not accused is merely a subject of investigation and his tax returns are available to the investigators through the U.S. Attorney’s office and this Court is aware of the task force that have the -- for instance the drug, person suspected of drug activities, they have the Internal Revenue Service working with them so the IRS gets in and they convene a Grand Jury specially for the purpose of subpoenaing evidence that they otherwise could not get.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.955" offset="3643162">They use it for investigatory purposes and then they turn the information over to the -- to the law enforcement officials by virtue of this Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.135" offset="3679838">They have the tax people, they have the drug people, they have the -- the Department of Justice, all working as a team and this is under some philosophies on appropriate method of investigating what is happening, but to me, it is discriminatory enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.137" offset="3743890">It is equal all over again, but it is hidden.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.802" offset="4414505">So by definition, we will not let you file the return and you become a felon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.384" offset="4532892">What is privileged or not privileged is judged by what the use of the material is at the time it is being trying to be used in a court at the time it is incriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.348" offset="4588690">In the broader aspects, as I say I believe that the way the government is acting, the way it is administering an otherwise fair statute, a reporting statute indicates that it is making criminal statutes and using the internal revenue reporting system as a method of enforcing criminal statutes or investigating criminal violations, something which Congress never intended to be about to do and something which at least in the process in which it is being done to write a letter and say I want this person’s information without having an affidavit in support of probable cause to show that there is reason.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="1547.786" offset="6294486">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.215" offset="6308174">The principal issue in this case and the only issue that I am likely to have time to discuss at any length is the issue to which Mr. Marks has addressed to all of his attention, that is whether a taxpayer has a Fifth Amendment privilege to exclude from evidence in a subsequent non-tax criminal proceeding his prior federal income returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.792" offset="6426457">For analytical purposes in this case, we have subdivided this principal issue into two separate questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.366" offset="6460729">First of these is to in what circumstances if any the disclosures on a taxpayer’s income tax return maybe said to be compelled within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.619" offset="6517781">And the second question is to what extent if any does the Fifth Amendment require the imposition of used immunity with respect to disclosures that have in fact been compelled under the federal income tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.817" offset="6582564">I will address each of these questions in turn, but with major emphasis on our contention that testimony or compulsion was lacking in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.767" offset="6630421">Before I take up these questions however, I would like to at least allude briefly to the significance of this case to the administration of the tax and non-tax criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.374" offset="6680785">Our underlying concern in this case is that if this Court were to hold in accordance with petitioner’s arguments here that a taxpayer’s disclosure is on his return are entitled to automatic use immunity, then in any non-tax criminal proceeding, a prosecutor would be subjected to the heavy burden of disproving taint in any case in which he had an occasion to review the defendant’s tax returns and those might well be a fairly large number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.961" offset="6815159">As we explained in our brief at greater length, pages 22 to 27, there are many situations in which a prosecutor may have occasion to review a defendant’s tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.962" offset="6867194">The easiest ones were envision as the case where taxpayer’s returns have been forwarded to the U.S. Attorney by the Internal Revenue Service with a request that the defendant be prosecuted for tax crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.796" offset="6922470">If a defendant has also been under investigation for non-tax offenses, the non-tax proceedings will then be subjected to inquiries obtained to turn whether any of the evidence has been derived from the taxpayer’s returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.751" offset="6994359">And there may be many other situations in which there are incidental exchanges of information between the Internal Revenue Service and Department of Justice which may give rise to claims obtained if there were was an automatic used immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.320" offset="7052559">Now, Mr. Justice Stewart, I think suggested that that issue was not really involved in this case because what we are concerned about is the possibility of an application of the “fruits” doctrine whereas all that is at issue here is the question of the admissibility of the tax returns themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.557" offset="7133539">But looking into the future, we might find it difficult if there were automatic used immunity as to the returns to distinguish cases like Counselman against Hitchcock and Kastigar which do require immunity from uses -- from indirect as well as direct use of the compelled disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.013" offset="7219325">These underlying considerations practicality or as I say spelled out in our brief and I will not enlarge it further upon them here, but I think that they are important considerations that should play a significant role in the Court’s analysis of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.585" offset="7909689">That is correct, but there is broad access for purposes of investigation of criminal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.698" offset="7934140">With these general thoughts in the background, I will turn now to the discussion of the question of testimonial compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.213" offset="7964128">And in approaching this question that is helpful at the outset to describe with some clarity the legal setting in which a taxpayer completes and files his internal -- his income tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.509" offset="8013343">The taxing statutes require that the taxpayer provide all the information requested on the return and a taxpayer must, subject to penalties for perjury, attest by his signature that the answers on his return are accurate and complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.125" offset="8075828">And a willful failure to file a complete return subjects the taxpayer to prosecution for a misdemeanor under Section 7203 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.474" offset="8121177">Now, petitioner and the dissenters in the Court of Appeals perceive the statutory scheme as exerting testimonial compulsion upon the taxpayer to incriminate itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.544" offset="8165480">They reasoned that any refusal by the taxpayer to complete his returns on Fifth Amendment grounds would subject him to prosecution for failure to file a return under Section 7203 and that threat of prosecution would be sufficient to induce a taxpayer to forgo a valid claim of privilege and thereby to compel self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.668" offset="8257954">Now, we believe that this conclusion reached by the petitioner and the dissenters below is based upon a fundamentally mistaken understanding of the scope of Section 7203 and an equally mistaken understanding of the pertinent constitutional principles that apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.027" offset="8327439">Section 7203 punishes only a willful failure to file0 and the concept of willfulness is crucial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.181" offset="8360040">Under this Court’s decision in United States against Bishop, a taxpayer cannot be convicted of a willful failure to file unless his failure represents a voluntary and intentional violation of a known legal duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.574" offset="8421585">And a taxpayer who believes that his privilege against self-incrimination justifies his refusal to provide an answer on a federal income tax return cannot be shown to have violated a known legal duty within the meaning of that phrase in the Bishop case because such a taxpayer by hypothesis has a good faith belief that his statutory duty to provide information has been constitutionally excused.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.955" offset="8679152">If a taxpayer asserts a claim of privilege on a return, it is incumbent upon the service to secure the information necessary to complete the return and to determine the amount of tax due.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.282" offset="8740488">And it does this first through informal mechanisms by sending the taxpayer letters such as it was sent to the petitioner here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2168.481" offset="8777268">Well, I do not think it is fair to say it was threatening him with prosecution, but pointing out that a failure to provide might subject him as indeed it might if his claim of privilege was invalid and in bad faith to a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.345" offset="8836723">If the taxpayer continued to assert his claim of privilege in informal conferences, the Internal Revenue Service if it determined that the privilege was not available could issue to him administrative summons requesting that he furnish the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.733" offset="8898267">And if a taxpayer continued to assert his privilege as a basis for refusing to comply with the summons, the service will then be required to seek enforcement of the summons in a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.674" offset="8953960">And at that point, the taxpayer would have -- would be entitled to an adjudication of his claim of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.315" offset="8984576">If the District Court recognized the claim of privilege, determined it to be valid, well then it would refuse enforcement of the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.731" offset="9022192">At that point, the service would in order to secure the information have to award the taxpayer immunity under 18 U.S.C. 6004 and with the award of immunity of course, the taxpayer could be ordered to provide the information sought in the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.920" offset="9098992">On the other hand, if the District Court determined that the claim of privilege was not valid, it could order enforcement of the summons without an accompanying ground of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.160" offset="9139952">But in either case, the taxpayer is subjected to compulsion only at the time the summons is ordered enforced and not before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.815" offset="9182584">And the petitioner in this case, never asserted this claim of privilege, he never invoked his administrative process, a fortiori he was not compelled to disclose information within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment or go back to the processes that would operate if the service determined that the taxpayer’s claims of privilege were in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.117" offset="9287805">At that time, if it secured out of good information on its own to determine the taxpayer’s liability or that there was sufficient information from which it can conclude that the claim of privilege was invalid and they are all by the way in many cases involving invalid claims of privilege by taxpayers who wish to assert such a claim of privilege as a basis for not filing a return at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.079" offset="9391668">Now, the service could then bring a prosecution, but as I pointed out, that prosecution could be successful only if it was established not only that the taxpayers claim of privilege was invalid, but also that the taxpayer knew that it was invalid and that he was making it in bad faith merely as a means of avoiding payment of his federal income tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.689" offset="9490097">In other words, the sanctions imposed by the threat of a prosecution under Section 7203 places no burden on the exercise of a valid claim of privilege or even upon a claim privilege of the taxpayer erroneously believes to be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.726" offset="9550179">And therefore, Section 7203, the enforcement mechanism in the code, does not coerce the taxpayer into foregoing a claim that he believes to be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.777" offset="9586437">It does not compel a taxpayer to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.553" offset="9605559">We think that this analysis is buttressed by this Court’s prior decisions under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.565" offset="9629591">In particular, the situation of a taxpayer completing his return maybe fairly analogized to that of a witness in a civil proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.581" offset="9665640">Both the taxpayer and the witness are confronted with authoritative directives to furnish information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.001" offset="9695315">I have already outlined the directives that are addressed to the taxpayer and those that are addressed to the witness are very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.226" offset="9724259">Often, the witness will be -- having summoned by legal process to appear and give testimony and at the time of giving testimony, he is required to affirm, subject to the penalties for perjury that he will tell the whole truth and if necessary, the judge will instruct him that he has a duty to provide evidence and that his refusal to do so may subject him to the punishment of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.104" offset="9823733">In other words, the judge may, like the service in the case of the petitioner, threaten the witness with the possibility of punishment if the information is not forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.538" offset="9869500">The circumstances therefore, faced by a taxpayer and a witness are not identical, certainly closely comparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.548" offset="9905549">We believe that the same constitutional rule should apply in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.704" offset="9926133">The rule for witnesses is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.368" offset="9936791">This Court has held and reaffirmed in a number of cases, most recently in United States against Kordel that self-incriminatory testimony given by a witness in an ordinary civil proceeding may be used against him in a subsequent criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.749" offset="10014323">The reason for this rule or the basis for this rule is set forth and explained by the Court and in the case called United States against Monia, and I think that is the pronunciation of it, M-O-N-I-A and we quote from that opinion on page 15 and I would like to repeat it because it bears directly upon are case as well.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="2546.659" offset="10289967">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.198" offset="10292057">We do not discuss this case at all in terms of waiver, but merely in terms of the absence of testimonial compulsion which I think is the way this Court has analyzed analogous cases in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.028" offset="10351407">Precisely the same consideration should govern this case as well as the case of the witness in the ordinary civil proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.908" offset="10382963">Although a taxpayer is under some official pressure to complete and file this tax return, pressure such as the letter that you have mentioned Mr. Justice Stewart, just as a witness is subject to some official pressure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.040" offset="10447433">The crucial point in each case is that the pressure is not such as would override or nullify a valid, timely asserted claim of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.737" offset="10494244">In neither situation is the sanction oppose upon the taxpayer or the witness for asserting a valid claim of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.227" offset="10528203">Thus in neither situation can answers furnished without any claim of privilege be treated as having been compelled within the meeting of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.126" offset="10579821">And this conclusion we think is further supported by contrasting this situation with those in which this Court has found testimonial compulsion in the past.and perhaps the most pertinent example is the case of the Garrity against New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.950" offset="10647113">In that case, a police officer was informed that -- was requested to testify in an inquiry into alleged traffic ticket fixing and he was informed that if he refused to testify that he would be removed from his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.739" offset="10726316">And under this threat, the policeman did testify and in doing so he incriminated himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.682" offset="10750035">The incriminatory disclosures were then introduced in evidence against him in a subsequent criminal proceeding arising out of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.009" offset="10791309">This Court determined that those disclosures were not admissible against the policeman in his trial, reasoning that the policeman’s desire to remain silent had been overborne by the threat of a severe economic sanction placed upon the very exercise of a valid claim of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.992" offset="10875319">In other words, in that case if the policeman in Garrity had claimed his privilege, he still would have been subject to the sanction of removal from office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.757" offset="10910323">In this case, if the petitioner had claimed this privilege, he would have been subject to no such sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.639" offset="10937908">Even if his claim of privilege I might add and reiterate was invalid so long as he in good faith believed it to be a valid one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.442" offset="10977092">Accordingly, unlike Garrity, we believe that the policeman in this case, excuse me, the taxpayer in this case, the petitioner was not subject to any compulsion to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.768" offset="11030381">Before going on to the second question that I have raised, I would like to further point out that even if in this case, this line of reasoning was rejected and it was concluded that the directives addressed to a taxpayer at the time that he completes and files his return, do represent testimonial compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.535" offset="11121497">There is no compulsion upon the petitioner in this case to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.422" offset="11141036">As we explained in footnote 13 of our brief on page 23, the disclosures made by the petitioner on his tax returns as Mr. Marks has conceded here were not incriminating when made and the privilege against self-incrimination only protects against the compelled disclosure of self-incriminatory information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.061" offset="11251586">It does not protect against the compelled disclosure of information that is not incriminating, but that only becomes incriminating because of the subsequent criminal activities of the witness so that in this case, even if it were found that in that testimonial compulsion is present, there was no testimonial compulsion to incriminate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.422" offset="11364958">I would also mention that the kinds of disclosures that were made here were not such as we have shown in our brief that I think is at pages 42 to 45 --</text>

            <text syncTime="2957.038" offset="11931501">What you are saying is even if the taxpayers be committed to invoke the privilege for the first time at trial, he should be required to establish not only of the previous disclosure, he now has a potential for incrimination, but also that it had that potential when made?</text>

            <text syncTime="2973.864" offset="11998793">Well, by that I think we meant that potential for incrimination means that the taxpayer does not have to -- that any person asserting a claim of privilege does not have to show actual incrimination, but only the potential of incrimination, if his answer provided and all we meant to say was that situation at the time of filing the return has to be the same as the time of subsequent use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.185" offset="12104014">I turn now to the second question that I undertook to address at the beginning of this argument which is to what extent, if any, the Fifth Amendment requires the imposition of use immunity with respect to disclosures that have in fact been compelled under the Federal Income Tax Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.798" offset="12182486">Time does not permit a full discussion of this issue and I can do a little more than outline the arguments that we set forth at some length at pages 27 to 41 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.816" offset="12238597">But we suggest there that in the context of the neutral self-reporting requirements of the Federal Income Tax Laws, the Fifth Amendment requires the imposition of use immunity only with respect to those compelled disclosures that constitute or that entail a substantial risk of prosecution and that the only disclosures on a tax return that entail such a risk are those involve a direct admission of criminality when made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.916" offset="12374956">Relevantly obnoxious disclosures that the petitioner made on his tax returns in this case clearly do not need that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.842" offset="12406721">These disclosures that he was a gambler, that he made money as a gambler were not admissions of criminality as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.641" offset="12445905">Now, our suggestion along these lines, draws in large part from this Court’s decision in California against Byers, in which it was held that a driver involved in an accident could be compelled under state hit and run statute to make certain disclosures and that those disclosures could be used against the driver in a subsequent criminal proceeding arising out of the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.631" offset="12557813">Although there was no opinion for the Court in that case, both the plurality opinion and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan evidence a concern that self-reporting requirements that further a legitimate, non-prosecutorial government purpose might be substantially hindered or frustrated by assertions of privilege based upon a mere possibility as contrasted with a substantial probability of incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.051" offset="12691560">We think that that concern is also appropriate here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.943" offset="12807126">We fear that widespread refusals to answer questions on tax returns based upon that relatively permissive Hoffman Standard of incrimination could seriously disrupt the administration of the taxing laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.860" offset="12994790">If on the other hand, a higher standard of incrimination is required in the self-reporting context that we are considering here, then it would be clear what questions on the return might entail a substantial risk of prosecution and those which would not and we suggest in our brief that the only questions on a taxpayers return that are likely, the answers to which are likely to entail a substantial risk of prosecution are those that relate to the source of miscellaneous income or possibly occupational though that seem somewhat unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.512" offset="13145359">We feel that permitting the invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege only on the basis of the higher standard of incrimination that we suggest would afford a substantial measure of protection to all individual taxpayers while at the same time not significantly impairing the government’s ability to secure and use the information needs in raising the revenue.</text>
