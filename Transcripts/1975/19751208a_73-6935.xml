            <text syncTime="28.571" offset="217567">The Illinois foster care payment scheme denies the federal foster care payments to children who are placed in foster homes maintained by their relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.396" offset="248914">The issues in this case are; first, whether the denial by the State of Illinois violates the Social Securities Act and the Supremacy Clause, and second, whether that denial violates Equal Protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.021" offset="299383">The best evidence that the Illinois foster care payment scheme is in violation of the Social Securities Act is found in the position of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, the department charged with the stewardship of administration of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.949" offset="355076">Twice; first, in a brief filed on behalf of the department by the Solicitor General in response to this Court’s invitation, and second, in a program instruction issued as recently as October of 1974, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has unequivocally taken the position that such payments must be afforded to related foster parents.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.263" offset="524349">I respectfully cite this Court to its ruling in Townsend versus Swank and the test therein contained which states that absent clear evidence on the face of the statute or in the legislative history that the states have the option to withhold the payments from a particular group of, otherwise eligible citizens, that those payments should be afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.822" offset="610553">I would also respectfully cite this Court to its recent decision in the case of Philbrook versus Glodgett.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.534" offset="637407">In that case, the State of Vermont attempted to exercise the option on behalf of the state to tell its citizens that they had to accept eligibility for the lower of two levels -- the lower of two categorical assistance programs for which they might be eligible.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.847" offset="5826684">The first of those is, can a relative under the Social Security Act ever be a foster parent and secondly, if a foster parent is paid additional assistance over and above what a relative is paid for to care for a needy and dependent child, can that violate the Equal Protection Clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.003" offset="5907350">I would like to direct myself to the first aspect of the case at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.156" offset="5923964">We would respectfully submit that the plain meaning of the provisions of Title V of the AFDC Program, support the conclusion that relatives are not foster parents and are not eligible for aid under the provisions of Section 608.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.101" offset="5983732">The basic AFDC Program set out in Title V defines essentially three classes of needy or dependent children who are eligible for aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.247" offset="6020304">Section 606 defines the first class and says that a dependent child is one who is deprived of parental support for certain specified reasons and lives with a relative specified in Section 606.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Bargiel</label>
            <text syncTime="1936.245" offset="7848248">Well, I think, first, this Court has -- this Court has on occasion, certainly more than once come to the conclusion that an HEW interpretation of a statute was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.412" offset="7900911">I think Burns v. Alcala was such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.366" offset="7916793">Our position here is that the first that the Court ought to look to the plain meaning, the words employed by the Congress in the statute in attempt to discern the intent of the Congress in enacting a particular Section of the statute and if the intent can be discerned in that fashion, then it ought to be followed and we are suggesting that Section 608 defines a class of needy dependent children does so in terms which are so unambiguous with reference to the Act that only one conclusion is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.720" offset="8042181">One conclusion as a parent and that is the relatives are not foster parents and I say if I may, very briefly refer to Court to the language employed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.786" offset="8078439">It says, at the beginning, the term “dependent child” shall, notwithstanding Section 606(a) of this Title, also include a child who would meet the requirements of such Section 606(a) or of Section 607 of this Title except for his removal after April 30, 1961 from the home of a relative and as a result of a judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.580" offset="8169659">And we submit that that part clearly indicates that Section 608, the definition of dependent child is to be applied notwithstanding any specified relative in Section 606 and it is also to include a new category of children -- the employment of the words “also include” indicates that this is a creation of a new class, and then it refers to -- further defines the class as children who are removed from the home of a specified relative and then if you drop down about five lines from the bottom to what is designated A3, it says “who was been placed in a foster family home or child care institution as a result as such determination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.810" offset="8322527">So, we are suggesting that, there the Congress has employed the term “foster family home or child care institution” and above they have talked about removing a child from the home of a relative and we would suggest that foster family home or child care institution means something other than the home of a relative because a child was removed from the home of a relative and put into a foster family home or child care institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.543" offset="8413433">So we would suggest that that language indicates that Congress intended that a foster family home was a non-related home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.426" offset="8441019">And if you go on, in that very same provision if you go to page A11 which continues the reproduction of Section 608 and you go to part F, part F requires that any state who intends to employ the foster care program also have a plan which, in my language, the provision indicates in my language, is to rehabilitate the home from which the child came so that, hopefully, the child can go back there and it says, the language here says that it must include a provision for --</text>

            <text syncTime="2127.659" offset="8613949">It says that the state plan must include a provision for development of a plan for each such child, including periodic review of the necessity of the child’s being in a foster family home or child care institution to assure that he receives proper care and that services are provided which are designed to improve the conditions in the home from which he was removed or to otherwise make possible his being placed in the home of a relative specified in Section 606.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.649" offset="8721887">And we submit that this provision, this requirement on the state has no meaning whatsoever once a child is already in the home of a relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.333" offset="8752607">These children came, at least as I understand it, from foster family homes where people were unrelated to them or they came from childcare institutions, and this provision in the Social Security Act has no meaning to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.622" offset="8797747">It has no meaning whatsoever if the purpose of the provision is to require the state to enable these children or enable a home from which they came, which was an unrelated home, to be such that the children can go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.961" offset="8871203">It is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.659" offset="8873920">I agree with counsel that children are in the home which is best suited for them and they are not receiving foster care anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.448" offset="8901087">I think that is the clear indication of these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.130" offset="8911850">I think this provision also indicates that foster care is temporary care by definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.680" offset="8934002">It is not intended to be a permanent placement for any child and yet if you consider the complaint which was filed in this particular case on behalf of the plaintiffs and all the necessary inferences and implications which come from that, they suggest they are in the best home which is possible for them and the care which they are receiving is not intended, at least on their part, to be temporary care but permanent care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.749" offset="9026266">So, we would submit that that also indicates that these people are not foster parents, the children are not foster children, and they are not receiving foster care, certainly not under the terms of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.676" offset="9074018">That, in a nutshell, is our position with regard to the Illinois welfare scheme as it comports to the Social Security Act, and therefore, the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.888" offset="9138906">We would also suggest that, with regard to the equal protection argument which is raised that the distinction between relatives and unrelated foster parents is based upon differences which are irrationally related to the foster care program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.103" offset="9195749">Now, it is clear that the statute which creates the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has, as its overriding purpose, the care of all the neglected children of the State of Illinois, and that purpose is also reflected in the aid of the families with dependent children program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.089" offset="11015647">I do not think there is any difficulty with that on an equal protection basis because the Federal Act, the Social Security Act itself does not require.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.604" offset="11065698">It has nothing to do with the need of the custodian who cares for the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.226" offset="11080222">It does not deal with that question at all under Section 606 or 608 or 607.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.180" offset="11104046">Eligibility is determined by the need of the child and under Section 608, it has to do with the home from which the child is removed. Under Section 608, an unrelated millionaire could take in a neglected child and that family would be eligible for AFDC, under Section 608 of the home from which the child was taken had been previously eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.618" offset="11205819">What I am saying is that need is not provided for, at least need of the custodian in the Social Security Act and it seems to me that there would be no difficulty with the state saying “in order to qualify for additional benefits which are not yours to begin with, you must show a need as a custodian.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.147" offset="11291918">I will attempt to finish up very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.370" offset="11308741">I would say here too that plaintiffs with regard to the equal protection argument that is raised, the plaintiffs ask the Court to consider the plight of relatives who live with people who are related to them who cannot afford to maintain those children if they do not receive the full foster care benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.330" offset="11396617">On the other hand, I think that their argument ignores the fact that there are many neglected children in the State of Illinois and in every state that do not have relatives to take care of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.878" offset="11434860">There just are not any or there are relatives who do not consider or would not consider taking care of these children.</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.968" offset="12967203">First, with respect to the suggestion of mootness, three of the four named minor plaintiffs began receiving the exception to policy payments which they considered to be foster care payments some 28 months after the suit was filed I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.456" offset="13017149">As Mr. Justice Brennan said, the Saldana (ph) case, and I would also cite this Court’s recent opinion in Gerstein v. Pugh and the federal rule that says the state must apply to the District Court if it wishes to moot the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.866" offset="13062811">Second, with respect to the state’s contention that the plaintiff-related foster parents are not foster parents; first, I would cite to the District Court’s opinion where it named them, the District Court said that they were foster parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.064" offset="13111608">Second, citing this Court to the federal foster care blueprint, Section 408 of the Act, foster care payments can be made to children placed in the home of any individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.032" offset="13163435">Now, under this Court’s opinion in the Shay case, I think any means any and had Congress meant any individual to mean any individual other than relatives, it would have in Section -- if Congress had meant those payments to be denied relatives, it would have set out in Section 408, the enumerated relatives in Section 606(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.892" offset="13246922">It did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.566" offset="13249535">When Congress said foster care payments can be made to children who are wards of the state placed in the home of any individual, it meant precisely what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.150" offset="13279941">The interpretation urged by the State of Illinois, I think, is a tortured one and I think the one urged by the plaintiffs is a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.566" offset="13309616">Congress examined children who had been removed from the home of their parents or a relatives, most usually their parents, and who were declared wards of the state, and it says and it recognized that those children were more expensive to care for and it further recognized in Section 401 of the Act that the best possible placement for those children was with a relative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.110" offset="13399791">I think it is not relevant whether or not the child was removed from a home of its parents or from the home of his relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.453" offset="13429153">I think with respect to the question -- let me go back to that.</text>
