            <text syncTime="53.930" offset="215667">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.175" offset="232699">This case is here writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.068" offset="260180">The question is whether an environmental impact statement must be prepared by the administrator of the Office of Interstate Land Sales Registration before the registration of subdivision lots under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act of 1968 may become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.285" offset="357042">To state the meaning of the question, I’ll have to explain the Disclosure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.065" offset="376163">The Disclosure Act requires developers selling or leasing 50 or more unimproved lot pursuant to a common promotional plan to file a registration statement called the statement of record with the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.958" offset="451814">The administrator is the delegate of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to whom the functions of carrying out the Disclosure Act have been assigned by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.216" offset="500820">The Act also requires the developer to furnish a document called a property report to each purchaser of a lot within the registered subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.125" offset="548467">The property report contains information from the statement of record which purchasers need to make their decisions and the statement of record is a detailed description of the property, its ownership, title, access roads, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.537" offset="630073">In some respects, the entire process is like a security’s registration and the property report is a good deal like a security’s prospectus describing a particular subdivision.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="169.005" offset="675944">But the law was more patterned on the Securities Act of 1933, wasn’t it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="172.720" offset="690782">Yes it was Your Honor and I think that’s quite a significant point in viewing the Act because the Securities Act of 1933 really represented a choice for Congress to go two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.333" offset="741251">It could have decided in favor of some degree of substantive regulation of the economic merits of securities issues and instead it opted simply for a disclosure requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.703" offset="786808">When Congress decided that there were problems about the interstate sale of subdivision lots, it could’ve done the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.837" offset="815334">It could’ve empowered the administrator to consider the merits of subdivision lots and make comments and recommendations on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.414" offset="857652">Instead it opted for not substantive regulation, but simply a system of full disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.301" offset="893179">This law was enacted in 1968, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.851" offset="911360">Now, unless these disclosure statements are on file and in effect, the developer may not use the mails or facilities of interstate commerce to sell or lease the lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.354" offset="953365">The statute provides that the administrator has 30 days from the date the developer files the disclosure statements with his office to determine whether they are accurate and complete in their disclosures under the Act and the regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.635" offset="1054511">No, in fact the Act is explicit on that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.266" offset="1073006">It provides in Section 1716 of the U.S. Code, 15 U.S.C 1716 that a registration may not be taken to mean that the secretary was delegate here, the administrator has passed upon the merits, that’s the language of the statute, has passed upon the merits of the development or has approved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.988" offset="1171853">So the Congress was quite clear, they did not want any kind of comment by the Federal Government or controlled by the Federal Government over the merits of land use planning or the use of subdivisions in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.707" offset="1238727">They simply wanted disclosure to protect purchasers.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.046" offset="1872144">In every case to ensure that there is adequate disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.067" offset="1888235">Now, the petitioners in this case are the secretary and the acting administrator and a private developer who’s the disclosure statements were suspended by the Court’s below until HUD had prepared an environmental impact statement on the merits of the project involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.794" offset="1947167">That project known as Flint Ridge is located on heights above the Illinois River which is 70 miles east of Tulsa roughly in northeastern Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.331" offset="1989277">Respondents, the plaintiffs below were environmental groups concerned with the preservation of the Illinois River in its natural state.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.504" offset="2018011">They sued to prevent Flint Ridge’s disclosure statements from becoming effective until HUD had prepared an environmental impact statement on the development.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.798" offset="2055105">The District Court and the Court of Appeals agreed with the respondents and suspended Flint Ridge’s registration until an impact statement is completed by the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.781" offset="2099096">Now, in our view this case only involves one issue whether Section 102 (2) (C) of the National Environmental Policy Act or NEPA applies to HUD’s supervision of developer’s disclosures under the Lands Sales Disclosure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.664" offset="2178612">There’s no question here that the NEPA applies in full to HUD’s activities respecting substantive regulation of any kind or grants or other substantive activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.889" offset="2247471">But we’re dealing with a narrow question that is what Section 102 (2) (C) requires in a situation like this where this is no substantive regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.455" offset="2285819">Section 102 (2) (C) of NEPA in effect requires federal agencies to include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement concerning environmental effects and alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.966" offset="2375784">It requires a federal agency to weigh the environmental merits of their planning and substantive decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.776" offset="2415073">But in our view, it doesn’t apply at every point of federal contact with the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.956" offset="2439732">There has to be a federal proposal or recommendation for and a report on major federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.337" offset="2473273">The language of 102 (C) is qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.181" offset="2484663">Now, the administrator here is empowered to review disclosure statements as this has already been indicated only for accuracy and completeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.366" offset="2521443">This, we submit, is not major federal action within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.677" offset="2538684">It’s not major federal action because the administrator cannot pass on the merits of projects and of course, you cannot write an environmental statement without passing on its merits at least to waive them and to list alternatives so that that point seems quite clearly barred by the statute itself expressly and it’s also barred because of the nature of the function since we are only dealing with the disclosure function.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.842" offset="2643278">Secondly, we submit that the administrator makes no recommendation or report on a proposal for major federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.176" offset="2676611">Now, I’ve already indicated that the statute bars the administrator from passing on the merits or proving any subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.132" offset="2712451">What Congress intended, was that land use planning should be reserved to that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.699" offset="2730736">In fact, it went so far as to say that no developer can represent that the secretary has approved or recommends any particular development and that’s even reflected in the property report as described in the regulations since on the face of every property report there’s a disclaimer.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.412" offset="2797610">That this property report does not represent any approval by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or any comment on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.855" offset="5007360">Most importantly, what the purpose of the impact statement is, is that it gives to the agency the power to take in to consideration as to whether or not it should permit the project to go forward, whether it should modify the project or whether or not it should stop the project altogether because the environmental consequences are so severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.991" offset="5135882">Now, if the agency under its Organic Act doesn’t have the power to permit the project to go ahead, to modify it, to reduce the environmental impact or to stop the agency’s action altogether, then there's no really no use or purpose fulfilled in the preparation of the statement because it's meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.618" offset="5254374">Now, to determine whether or not an agency has the power to permit action to go forward, to modify the proposed action or to stop it altogether, you have to look to the Organic Act under which the agency was created to determine whether or not the agency has such authority and powers under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.498" offset="5353953">In this case when you look at ILSA, you will see that ILSA was passed by Congress and dealt with the subject of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.843" offset="5399301">In the spectrum of land development, sales is at the very end because what has preceded sales is land acquisition, the planning, the financing and to a substantial extent, development and development afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.883" offset="5483520">All of those things which preceded sales HUD has no involvement in and has no authority and has no jurisdiction over the developer’s activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.661" offset="5562619">No federal approval was required by HUD in connection with that acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.908" offset="5587592">When Flint Ridge was doing its planning and when it was doing all of the things that had to be done to comply with the state and local laws of Oklahoma, there was no approval required by HUD in connection with those approvals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.644" offset="5658540">And when Flint Ridge obtained it's financing, no federal approval was required by HUD in connection with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.907" offset="5699605">And more importantly at the time that Flint Ridge began it's construction which was in 1973, which was more than six months prior to the time that HUD that it filed it's registration statement with HUD.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.762" offset="5758955">It actually undertook its construction activities and by the time of the trial of this case, it has spent over $3.5 million in construction on this development.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.237" offset="6568856">What we have here is an action brought by several thousand people of the State of Oklahoma who have come together in one way or another, in action against the Federal Government to seek compliance and enforcement of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.163" offset="6628624">The shorthand law is NEPA, of course we have a problem when we used the shorthand of sometimes forgetting what the meaning of the language is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.027" offset="6748056">For example, we’ll start off with this proposition; the Department of Housing and Urban Development absolutely refuses to comply with the National and Environmental Policy Act, period.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.625" offset="7790446">I don’t think that in another issue is not what the HUD can do anything about environmental degradation it finds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.638" offset="7814478">Although there are I believe many things they can do about it, provide information to others for example and in HUD -- HUD has promulgated what is called Handbook 1390.1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.846" offset="7859304">There are guidelines for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and part of that, part of that requires and directs the members of the department to meet with and discuss these matters with the developer or the applicant to work out an amicable way of resolving some of these things without necessarily through an enforcement procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.476" offset="7957838">Now, there are other things that are not at issue before this Court and I think it goes to the question of what really is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.025" offset="7984065">The facts are not an issue, the significance of the degradation is not at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.337" offset="8009247">Judge Bohanon found actual potential effect in all aspects of the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.311" offset="8033176">For example, upon the depth and course of the river itself, upon social economic conditions, aesthetic conditions, the habitat, fish and wildlife, these were un-appealed from and not an issue before this Court and you will find that his finding number 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.476" offset="8093884">Another matter that is not an issue before this court and which is admitted is that the filing and the permission to sell interstate commerce facilitates the developer in obtaining money in interstate commerce and without that, this development would not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.252" offset="8176953">They talked about there would degradation anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.390" offset="8189492">Well, that’s a talking about something in the abstract because in the facts of this case, there would not be degradation anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.414" offset="8221571">We note that they have said, they are not doing anything now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.110" offset="8236408">Much of this money is spent for other things in environmental degradation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.530" offset="8254067">For example, in the record and it reflects that less than one half of the payrolls are in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.411" offset="8273607">Less than one-third of the unpaid rolls are in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.610" offset="8286354">There are only 16 of a potential of 3,000 septic tanks in an area that’s ill-suited for septic tanks according to the findings of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.081" offset="8320313">There virtually no structures existing on the 7,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.918" offset="8335569">The human involvement there is minimal at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.083" offset="8348317">The socio economic problems that would ensue as a result of this development are yet to occur and will occur in the future and perhaps by thinking about it now, we may be able to mitigate that either to state, local or federal level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.236" offset="8400875">Another problem of that argument is they can ask you to freeze in point and time the question of environmental impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.279" offset="8429087">And consider the Flint Ridge as in a vacuum which the Court did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.956" offset="8447791">There are peripheral effects, other developments may occur, side issues with respect to developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.440" offset="8473704">So, there are satellite developments and this sort of thing may occur and this is a very fragile ecosystem, the Illinois River basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.160" offset="8504633">We also see that many of the effects that will flow from this development will be continuing in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.333" offset="8541309">We also suggested the option for example for 14,000 more acres has been dropped and some of the things they talk about, about exempting laws and so forth, they haven’t done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.731" offset="8590838">In fact, in a letter to this Court asking that it be advanced for hearing, they did complain of the fact that they were at a stand still if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.121" offset="8624483">So, there is significance to what the Tenth Circuit said and what Judge Bohanon said about money in interstate commerce and the connection between the filing, the approval to sell interstate commerce and the obtaining of money, and the environmental degradation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.090" offset="8688327">The issue in this case must be considered to what HUD is trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.529" offset="8702015">HUD is trying to get this court to condone their excessively narrow construction of their operating authority inspite of what Congress said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.955" offset="8739736">The issue is very simple, must HUD under the facts of this case prepare an environmental impact statement in a format tailored to the circumstances of this case, prior to giving permission to sell in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.188" offset="8804728">The answer is simple, yes they must and why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.229" offset="8816849">It is compelled by the language of statute itself by this legislative history of the statute by all cases which are construed in the National Environmental Policy Act to date, by CEQ guidelines and by HUD’s own Handbook 1390.1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.875" offset="8879438">Do we have major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.671" offset="8898664">And you can't bifurcate that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.417" offset="8905665">It's all part of the same term and whether you have two or three tests really don’t make any difference under the facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.136" offset="12052480">Now, both the Interstate Land Sales Act and NEPA have been amended and in fact since the investigation of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.934" offset="12079647">Now, I’m sure that Congress knows how to exempt the Department of Housing and Urban Development from compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.866" offset="12103367">They do so by saying that nothing herein shall be considered major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.649" offset="12130534">They have done it in several statutes but not in this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.023" offset="12148088">To come before this Court and argue that there is a conflict is to admit a specific violation of Section 103.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.110" offset="12180376">Section 103, required all these agencies, HUD included, to review their operating authority and their statutory mandate, to determine whether there are any inseparable barriers to compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.020" offset="12236069">There’s nothing to indicate that that review process was to await the taking of major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.335" offset="12273267">We must conclude therefore that HUD did it, and found no inseparable barrier to compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.383" offset="12297509">As the Court said Calvert Cliffs, it’s too late now to raise this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.870" offset="12327393">Compliance is consistent with CEQ guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.792" offset="12343066">CEQ guidelines talked about a license and entitlement to use or a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.926" offset="12367621">And in fact, the CEQ itself, in the letter dated January or July 7th, 1975 from the director, to David O. Meeker of Housing and Urban Development, talked of several items that needed further discussion and attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.623" offset="12430420">And among these evidence that concerned about NEPA compliance in the Office of the Interstate Land Sales and suggested ways of complying such as the incorporate information in the environmental impacts in the statement of record, establish thresholds to determine significance, prepare program EIS and this sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.441" offset="12505757">And he said, “We believe that HUD could solve the issue by taking steps in line with the above suggestions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.442" offset="12525714">So, CEQ themselves feels that there is not compliance and of course they’re entitled -- their determination entitled a great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.082" offset="12564271">Is there a conflict by administrative burden?</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.107" offset="12572421">They talked about the administrative burden in their briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.219" offset="12584856">We begin with the preface that Congress did intend to interrupt business as usual in these agencies which here to for have not cared one iota.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.764" offset="12622994">And before this Court today, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, does not care one iota about the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.507" offset="12649953">The GAO, I think and we’ve cited this in our brief has criticized them, and I think they’ve quite correctly characterized their lack of concern as based on empire building.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.041" offset="12696137">We could go further and to say they flat don’t care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.228" offset="12716826">The facts of the case control was the type of compliance and it’s not that difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.680" offset="12742635">One of the purposes, I think, we pointed out has been partially fulfilled and that is inter-agency cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.525" offset="12766041">The statute must be read as whole and to foster inter-agency cooperation as one of the purposes.</text>
