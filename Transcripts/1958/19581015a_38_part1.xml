          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_b_gay" startTime="156.831" stopTime="346.643">
            <label>Mr. Thomas B. Gay</label>
            <text syncTime="156.831" offset="730676">I desire to do that, Your Honor because that is one of the fundamental positions that we wish to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.295" offset="756590">Section 58-546 says “franchise tax” on express companies; “each express company doing business in this state shall on or before the first day of June of each year pay to the State a franchise tax which shall be in lieu of taxes upon all of its other intangible property and in lieu of property taxes on its rolling stock.”</text>
            <text syncTime="186.358" offset="848854">The next section, model franchise tax; “The franchise tax shall be equal to 2 3/20 % of the gross receipts derived from operations within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.188" offset="900159">If its operations are partly within and part of an intrastate the gross receipts derived from operations within the State shall be deemed to be all receipts on business beginning and ending within the State, and all receipts derived from transportation within the State of express transported through, into or out of the state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="219.244" offset="980302">Although, the question is not before the Court, in view of what I understand to be its acceptance of interpretation of constitutional and statutory application by state courts, it is significant and I -- I wish to point out to the Court that since the Commission under Virginia Court held that this tax was imposed pursuant to the authority conferred by Section 170 of the Constitution of Virginia, and that section reads “the general assembly may impose State franchise taxes, and in imposing a franchise tax may, in its discretion, make the same in lieu of taxes upon other property, in whole or in part, of a transportation, industrial or commercial corporation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="276.731" offset="1210284">Now it is our contention in the lower court and we think that the reasonable interpretation of the two sections of the Constitution makes it apparent that that section in authorizing the imposition of a franchise tax had reference only to corporations doing as a fully and intrastate business, or at least on inter -- any intrastate business since Section 163 of the Constitution inhibits any foreign corporation, no foreign corporation shall be authorized to carry on in the state the business or to exercise any of the powers or functions of a public service corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.092" offset="1391783">So we urged upon the law of Court that this Section 170, authorizing the imposition of franchise taxes, should be construed in the light of the related section of the Constitution to mean and to apply to, and to authorize the imposition of franchise taxes on only those corporations that you are indeed solely in intrastate business or inter and intrastate business.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.667" offset="1582059">Well I'd like to answer that by saying that when the -- if I may anticipate my argument a little bit, in 1928 when the Express Company was organized – it was a Delaware corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.098" offset="1627721">It was qualified to do business intra and interstate in every state in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.008" offset="1647365">It applied to the State of Virginia for authority to do an intrastate business, was denied by the Corporation Commission under this Section 163 of the Constitution, the Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed and this Court affirmed that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.944" offset="1735137">Now appellant contends that the tax imposed on it in this case, although named or called a “franchise tax,” and although stated to be in lieu of certain property taxes, is nothing but the old license tax which was previously before this Court and therefore, it's -- it's a privilege imposed upon the right to transact interstate Commerce and therefore void of a violation of the Commerce Clause; and secondly, that the amount of the tax is such and the amount in which it was assessed is such as to constitute denial of due process in the substantive sense to the appellant in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.698" offset="2586206">Well now as I've said the -- this statute that one's that's been enacted 1906 resulted from the prior to the decision of this Court in Railway Express Agency versus Virginia which was decided in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.653" offset="2654020">In that case, a license tax was imposed upon the appellate for the privilege of conducting its business in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.853" offset="2690800">Now appellant here in this appeal contends that under the doctrine respect the case and under the rule of law laid down in the prior decision between the same party in 1954, that the tax imposed under the present statute being on gross receipts just as it was in the prior act, and since those gross receipts are derived exclusively from interstate commerce, that the tax is in fact a privilege and not a property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.119" offset="2827891">If I may give just a brief historical statement as to the nature of this company's business and the prior litigation between it and the State so that in that background the Court may better understand the issue arising here.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.836" offset="2890689">As I've said, the Express when it was organized in 1928 to take over all the express business.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.092" offset="2911692">It was organized by the Railroad and is presently owned by the Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.244" offset="2932381">It went to and obtained authority to do business in every State in the union, interstate and intrastate except the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.295" offset="2968534">It was denied a part that to do an intrastate business in Virginia because of this provision of the Constitution as I've read and the Virginia freighters were affirmed by this Court in reaching that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.540" offset="3025481">Now in consequence, as this Court said on a prior appeal -- it's just the word -- as a consequence of the state's own policy, this appellate does no business in Virginia, which a State has the power to prohibit, but thus holds as such as it can conduct on the protection of the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.987" offset="3135300">The (Inaudible) state Express falls within the power of the State to control, a separate Virginia subsidiary necessarily was organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.031" offset="3179499">So the Virginia company, the Railway Express Agency Company of Virginia was organized and the record shows that under a stipulation that's -- from that time until now the Virginia Company has done wholly on intrastate business in Virginia and the appellant has done solely on interstate business in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.030" offset="3267480">The Virginia Company has paid all of its profit taxes without complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.330" offset="3284720">It paid the prior license tax; and it has paid this franchise tax based on its gross receipts derived from intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.405" offset="3313037">The appellate here has paid all of its property taxes from the time it came down until the present year; it paid a prior license tax on the protest until this Court decided the Spector Motor Company case when it filed a petition for correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.895" offset="3375000">And it has been almost successful in that appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.542" offset="3393494">It has not to pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.816" offset="3406660">Thus it has paid the present franchise tax which was the first year, 1956, after legislature passed this new Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.357" offset="3436753">It paid it under protest, and filed a petition with the Commission for it's correction on the ground, as I've said, that it was violative of the Commerce Clause and that was the burden on interstate commerce and its not -- not enforced as a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.549" offset="3505612">The Commission and the Virginia Court held that property -- the tax to be a property tax and this is -- this is the meat of the case, upon the going concern or goodwill value of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.646" offset="3557961">Now that is the property that it has -- it has sought to be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.782" offset="3598503">So that -- so that was, I think it was, that was what the Virginia Court had held in the prior case under the license tax statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.362" offset="3636851">And this Court reversed that holding that this statute was -- was a burden on interstate commerce was not a property tax, but a privilege tax, or the Virginia Court had held it to be such on a so-called “system or scheme” of allocating values for taxation of state and local purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.530" offset="3713442">Then the Virginia legislature passed this 1956 Act which I have read to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.684" offset="3742072">Now a further statute, Mr. Justice Douglas, let these three changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.175" offset="3768090">It changed the need from a franchise -- from a privilege to a franchise tax but this Court has many times said that labels don't control its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.778" offset="3810513">The second, here the taxes made in lieu of certain other property whereas the old tax were in addition to other property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.387" offset="3860877">Our contention is, is that the tax -- if a direct tax on gross receipts was merely measured the extent of the privilege exercised and does not determine the value of the property employed in the business to produce those earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.686" offset="3954082">Thirdly, the present tax does not say expressly that it's for the privilege of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.641" offset="3985951">But the important thing is since the sole basis of a levy is the fact you have done business and is computed on the basis of your gross receipts for the prior year, the absence of that language is unimportant.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.778" offset="4046451">So those three differences are the only differences in the (Inaudible) between the old tax and the new tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.386" offset="4092949">It seems to us that the determining factor in this Court's prior decision which has not recognized or considered or if it was, it was not accepted, the (Inaudible) Virginia Commission or the Virginia Court was that gross receipts are no proper measure of value in the formal appeal, this Court said, but the taxing dispute deal does not depend on owning any physical property nor upon the value thereon but would be levied on gross revenues even if it'd come to find some way to dispense with all local and physical property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.175" offset="4276120">The fact that it's measured as gross revenue is consistent with the tax on the privilege of doing a volume of business which would yield that revenue just as that legislature indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.072" offset="4327633">Now -- but we have declined with your mere gross receipts as a sound measure of going concern value in a practical world of commerce where value depend on profitableness of a business not merely it's volume citing the case of United States (Inaudible) Oak Creek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.393" offset="4424913">We said that that is the nub of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.902" offset="4439019">It was the principle which this Court laid down in the prior decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.948" offset="4455215">It was ignored by both the Commission and the Virginia Court and we say that the determinating factor in deciding whether or not this is a property or privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.204" offset="4504221">Now it's significant too that the Virginia Commission never un -- undertook to determine the value of this going concern or goodwill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.944" offset="4551137">It made no ascertainment of what it was worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.561" offset="4569631">On the contrary, as the formula which it worked out, to determine the amount of the tax is found at page 109 of the record, Gross receipts could be taxed $6.5 million, taxed at 2.15%, $139,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="1213.155" offset="4956035">I digress a moment to -- to point out at what seems to us the -- the labored manner in which the Commission tried to justify this tax traditionally and historically from the time -- for this to come -- that came into Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.897" offset="5022908">It's automotive equipment, that is its trucks that run around the streets and these little dolly trucks in the stations have been taxed as tangible personal property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.028" offset="5095528">The rolling stock of this company had been so infrequent in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.385" offset="5124890">And at -- on the mileage basis, the taxes for the years up to 1950 had been so negligible that after that the Commission, there were assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.800" offset="5166582">If you had assessed them in -- in 1956 on the same basis you've had an assessment before, it would have been about $200 and some dollars as I recall it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.037" offset="5203571">But the Commission said, “No longer do we regard this automotive equipment and these little dolly trucks as tangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.771" offset="5246412">We're going to call them rolling stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="1871.521" offset="7589491">The total profit of tangible and the intangible, office furniture, real estate intent for the way of money was $456,565.</text>

            <text syncTime="1918.065" offset="7775587">But if we know what the tax is its $120,000, we know what the rate of taxation of intangible, or personal property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1930.959" offset="7827205">So if you apply the rate to the actual tax we will have to have a goodwill value of $27,947,000 to justify this tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2384.590" offset="9641775">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.166" offset="9655986">As always when I commence an argument I'd -- I've been held to say about 12 different things at once because there are so many things particularly when you follow learned from the counsel on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.569" offset="9709693">But I would like to ask the Court in opening to -- if they would please look at page 31 of the record because I can see that a good deal of the argument that has been heard has had to do with the amount of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.454" offset="9773223">And at the very bottom of page 31 of the record, the appellant's only witness is leaving the stand, Mr. Callaway asked, “Have you any other witnesses Mr. Gay?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.945" offset="9835186">And Mr. Gay says, “No that is our case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.428" offset="9845112">Then if you would turn to page 32, so little had been said about the amount of the tax that Commissioner Callaway asked - “In your petition you have a paragraph stating that the amount of the tax, the amount of $139,000 was not correctly computed, do you now waive that point?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.079" offset="9927659">“No sir we don't waive it because now opinion from a legal standpoint there is no way that a tax could be computed with a yearly franchise tax of the State of Virginia based on gross receipts which would not be unconstitutional.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.834" offset="9982725">Now, the point I'm trying to make is the Commission and the Virginia Court both felt that the only issue which was being raised here seriously and which was being litigated here was whether this was a property tax or whether this was a -- same old privilege tax and the amount of the tax has never really since gone into fully by the Commission or by the Virginia Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2552.353" offset="10312808">Yes that's the -- one of the important facts of this case which I believe will draw a contest in this case in the prior appeal between these two parties is the fact that all of the property of this appellant, the Delaware Corporation, is being used in intrastate commerce and the Delaware Corporation is compensated for the use of that property in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.986" offset="10467349">Now that comes about in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.860" offset="10482813">The Delaware Corporation has a contract with the various carriers throughout the country, 177 railroads, a number of airlines, boat lines and electric lines many of which operate in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.352" offset="10552822">Under this contract with the various carriers, the Delaware Company has obligations to perform express services intrastate within the Commonwealth of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.287" offset="10604544">Now it had the problem of doing intrastate business in Virginia as a foreign public service corporation so it created a wholly-owned, wholly-controlled Virginia subsidiary, which I shall call the Virginia Corporation, the Virginia Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.771" offset="10674448">It entered into a contract with the Virginia Company under the terms of which the Virginia Company is obligated to perform the intrastate activities and obligations of the Delaware Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.145" offset="10739963">It does not go out and make its own contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.058" offset="10751561">It performs the obligations of the Delaware Company in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.220" offset="10772250">And under the contract the Delaware Company agreed to permit the Virginia Company to use its property in the performance of the interstate function and under the contract the Del -- the Virginia Company agreed to turn over to the Delaware Company all of its revenue and the Delaware Company assumes all the bills and saves the Virginia Company owns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.806" offset="10874546">So, that we have a situation of a foreign Corporation, not engaging in interstate commerce, but permitting its wholly-owned and controlled subsidiary could use its property to engage in intrastate commerce, and the parent corporation receiving all of the revenue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.651" offset="11253948">Now I make this point if Your Honor please, Mr. Justice Whittaker, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.377" offset="11284877">One, I believe that the use of the property in the state would afford a basis for taxation and secondly, because from a factual standpoint when you deal with the amount of the tax and the value of the Delaware company's property, I believe it can readily be seen that the privilege of using, having the joint use of properties between these two companies would make the Delaware Company's property in Virginia more valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.726" offset="11402324">A truck, one truck, which has the privilege along with it of using two other trucks, is certainly more valuable than one truck standing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.597" offset="11445791">So that the Virginia company -- the Delaware Company's property has increased value because it can be used in conjunction with the Virginia Company's value for more compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.770" offset="11658428">Also, this joint use of property is important when we get to the -- to the other argument which has not been reached in oral argument but it was contained in the brief that due to the proportion of the tax or the revenues which are attributable to Virginia, it was said in our brief that the 1.7 of the revenues are attributed to Virginia under the formula whereas, only six-tenths of 1% of their property is located in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.950" offset="11783189">Obviously, because part of their ownership is in a separate corporation in Virginia that is going to follow that their revenues in Virginia, since they can use the Virginia property to help earn those revenues, their -- their revenues will be proportionately greater in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.255" offset="11860407">Now, I would like also in the very early stages, to comment upon the amendments to this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.999" offset="11919339">I believe, technically, this was not -- Mr. Justice Brennan this statute, it was an amendment and reenactment of the old Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.620" offset="11973883">The Appellant says that there were three changes and only three changes made in this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.484" offset="12005334">Well, after this part of the field was decided, Virginia has re-funded the taxes through the entire period of limitation and did not thereafter assess the so-called License Act against the Appellate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.574" offset="12073671">And in 1956 they re-amend -- they amended and reenacted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.862" offset="12094777">Appellant says it is identical in all material respects and made only were only three changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.110" offset="12111809">One, they changed the name; two, they make it in lieu of rather than in addition to certain other state property taxes; and three, that they omitted the phrase that is, “for the privilege of doing business in Virginia.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.809" offset="12170637">We say that there were three additional very material changes in this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.831" offset="12202715">The first of these is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.066" offset="12215672">Under the 1954 statute, there was contained in the statute a provision that the intangible property of Express Company should be taxed at the rate of 50 cents per $100 in value and that the money of Express Company should be taxed at the rate of 20 cents per $100 in value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.821" offset="12298637">Both of those taxes were received in the process of amending and re-enacting this Act and that is why we say that the use of this 50 cents per $100 value formula which runs their going concern value up to $27 million, Mr. Justice Whittaker, I believe you were having trouble with how we arrived with a $27 million figure, but he does define a very simple process of taking the amount of the tax $139,000 and he says “if you were going to raise $139,000 taxes using the tax rate of 50 cents per 100 you'd have to have $27 million in value.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.410" offset="12480972">Well the fallacy in the argument is that there isn't a tax rate of 50 cents per $100 in value applicable to express companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.230" offset="12512319">There was found in the prior appeal and this Court used that very mathematical process in the opinion of saying that if you treated it as an intangible property, the tax rate on intangible was this 50 cents per 100 then it would have to have a value of x number of million dollars.</text>
