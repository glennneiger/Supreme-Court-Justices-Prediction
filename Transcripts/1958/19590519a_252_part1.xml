            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 252, Safeway Stores Incorporated, Appellant versus Oklahoma Retail Grocers Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.738" offset="246366">Mr. Clark, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ramsey Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="43.490" offset="277295">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.009" offset="291401">This case is an appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma a probable jurisdiction was noted last October.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.481" offset="329331">It involves the Unfair Sales Act of the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.798" offset="350542">It's the first such Act that has come before this Court for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.535" offset="373530">It is also the only Unfair Sales Act among the 31 in existence in the United States and the various States today that treats the right to meet competition as it is here treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.550" offset="437582">This statute was originally the Act in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.883" offset="458898">It was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in 1949 and before the opinion of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma had become final in less than 35 days, the new Act had gone to the legislature and had been passed removing the particular objections of the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma have had.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.953" offset="575195">In that course to the legislature in a period of 35 days, there was added a new type of meeting competition defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.975" offset="611244">Under the statute, a -- an offense involves three elements, a sale below cost, the intent on the part of the seller by that sale to damage competition and the effect on competition by that sale of damaging competition and the market and competitors in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.207" offset="752201">The “meeting competition” defense in this statute says that you shall have the right to meet a competitor selling at his cost or above.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.285" offset="832554">It does not say that you can meet the lawful price of a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.691" offset="862124">It does not say that you can meet legal competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.362" offset="884799">Every other Unfair Sales Act permits specifically the meeting of lawful competition, legal prices or the unqualified meeting of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.721" offset="946239">This statute alone prohibits the meeting of competition that is selling below its cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.132" offset="987930">About a year after the re-enactment of the Unfair Sales Act, another condition in the market came into being which created the circumstances of this case, trading stamps, which will be described more fully here and after, arrived on the scene in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.912" offset="1074970">In 1952, Sperry &amp; Hutchinson, the large -- the largest trading stamp company in the world had only two accounts in the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.420" offset="1109034">By 1954, the time at which this case was filed, over 100 different merchants, some with numbers of stores were giving -- were getting trading stamps in connection with sales of groceries in the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.610" offset="1177788">Thus the statute created two problems, for the merchants in Oklahoma.This case was admittedly a test case to answer these two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.664" offset="1246020">The questions were generally, when under this statute can the right to meet competition prevail and what can a merchant do to meet the competition of trading stamps given by a competitor in connection with his sales at cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.049" offset="1355525">Now, very briefly, what happened is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.184" offset="1364093">In the summer of 1954, the retail grocery competition in the State quickened.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.176" offset="1388126">Prior to that time the -- the no injunction suit -- only one injunction suit, excuse me only one injunction suit has ever been brought under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.531" offset="1425533">It's been on the books for three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.721" offset="1434206">In 1954, competition quickened in the cities of Shawnee, Enid, Norman and Tulsa, competitors of this appellant commenced selling below their cost, their statutory cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.906" offset="1486973">Now, statutory cost is not the cost in the usual connotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.488" offset="1509334">It is invoice cost plus incidentals to placing the goods in the store such as taxes, transportation and carriage plus a proportionate part of the doing -- of the cost of doing business, which is set by the statute at 6% for the cost of doing business, in the absence of proof of a different policy of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.511" offset="1609435">So, under any circumstances cost under the statute is 6% above the cost to the grocer of putting the merchandise on his shelf for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.854" offset="1658755">In Oklahoma City, a brisk trading stamp war erupted and there were numerous instances by trading stamp merchants at which they gave trading stamps in connection with sales made at their statutory cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.307" offset="1736600">In this connection, the record shows no variation from this rule, the traffic items and the grocery stores which are those that handful of items perhaps 50 out of 7500 up to 10,000 different items sold by the store, the traffic items, the staples, the items the housewife buy each week.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.628" offset="1837850">The items that the housewife has, the most consciousness at the prices on, were being sold by the merchants in the State of Oklahoma at identical prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.924" offset="1891035">The trading stamp merchants envision thereto, were giving trading stamps in connection with these sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.813" offset="1918621">Appellant, Safeway Stores, reduced its prices to meet this competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.717" offset="1954252">It was enjoined by the Oklahoma Retail Grocers Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.011" offset="1979434">It was sued for an injunction and subsequently enjoined from selling below cost in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.548" offset="2017573">Appellant filed a cross action.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.842" offset="2026768">Originally the cross action involve all of the retail grocers in the Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.649" offset="2045994">By stipulation it was later agreed that only Louie Speed would be involved, Louie Speed being a stamp-giving merchant.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.537" offset="2077550">Louie Speed in two of his stores sold strictly for cash no credit sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.077" offset="2099702">It was stipulated and the record shows without equivocation that every price violation charged to Safeway was sent to meet competition and was equal to prices set by that competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.842" offset="2178696">As to the trading stamps, the appellant calculated their value by an exhaustive survey and reduced its prices to meet the price at which each competitor sold that commodity less the value of the trading stamps.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.370" offset="3120880">They reduced prices on over 200 non-traffic items.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.326" offset="3140629">They did not reduce these prices below cost and they advertised extensively saying we have reduced prices on 200 items and they listed the prices and they found that these did not offset the value of the trading stamps.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.341" offset="3232684">They made purchases at prices and the stores of their competitors that they met and they had their people go into the store and make the purchase to ascertain for sure that this is the price at which the commodity was being sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.442" offset="3297155">In the case of the -- of the trading stamp, they took the cash register receipt, the commodity and the trading stamps and calculated the price.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.143" offset="3527973">Now, the trial court after about a three-day hearing enjoined appellant from selling below its cost to meet the price of a merchant selling below his cost and from reducing its price below cost to meet the value of trading stamps refused to enjoin the appellee who was giving the trading stamps from the continuance of that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.427" offset="3637060">The Supreme Court affirmed this ruling by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.362" offset="3656808">It said that Safeway could not justify its below cost price on competitors below cost price.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.609" offset="3765791">This immediately created the vacuum that competitor could be selling below his cost for a lawful purpose, traffic items, a few meeting or if Safeway met him now under this injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2476.904" offset="10010937">I really think that when it was tried in the State of Oklahoma it wasn't nearly as much on this trading stamp question as it has become right here in this oral argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.237" offset="10228276">The trading stamps have been in general use through out the United States at least since 1896.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.174" offset="10264116">Like every other promotional device this being a device to promote sales through the giving of trading stamps which effect a cash discount for business has gone through swings of prosperity and declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.845" offset="10342797">But the Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Company has been in that business continually since 1896, never defaulting on any of its obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.288" offset="10384488">You are all, I am sure, aware of the increase since World War II in the volume of trading stamps or that has come about particularly through the use of trading stamps in the supermarket.</text>

            <text syncTime="2611.498" offset="10549373">The specific trading stamps are now prohibited in just two States, plus the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.013" offset="10583437">The District of Columbia as a matter of fact has a so-called Gift Enterprise Act which bars the use of trading stamps and manufacturer's coupons and soap wrap and everything of that kind and it's honored only in the breach except as to trading stamps.</text>

            <text syncTime="2819.644" offset="11381948">Then in 1918, you had three cases that reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.095" offset="11399711">One from the State of Florida and two from the State of Washington and Pitney against Washington was the trading stamp case and in that case, this Court said, “we will look at this tax on trading stamps redeemable in merchandise for what it really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.371" offset="11492812">It's a prohibitive tax, so we will consider that the State of Washington has prohibited the use of trading stamps redeemable in merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.280" offset="11532518">And as to that, we will sustain it because there is something so indefinite about stamps redeemable in merchandise, but perhaps an ignorant person with the attraction of trading stamps might be led -- might be misled rather to pay her money unwisely but this Court pointed out that if trading stamps were redeemable in cash about which there could be no uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.610" offset="11653831">So then this Court would not sustain a prohibition whether it was couched as a tax or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="4036.175" offset="16248038">He says that Safeway can cut a dollar item to 97 cents and that what it's done is to give a cash discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.457" offset="16285236">No, I say that's not a cash discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.741" offset="16302373">A discount for cash is something that's done for cash, not to sell tomatoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.536" offset="16325465">If you mark tomatoes down from a dollar to 97 cents, you haven't given a discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.082" offset="16347721">You've have cut the price three cents for the Safeway who wanted to adopt its own cash discount system in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.606" offset="16381785">It could say we're in the cash business, we want to encourage cash trade in order to encourage cash trade, we will give a discount of 2% in cash and then when the housewife comes through the check out counter, if she has a $10.00 charge to pay, they give her back 20 cents and there's nothing under this injunction or under this law which would forbid it, but that's quite definitely not what Safeway did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.451" offset="16501217">What Safeway did was to take two-page ads and say, who is selling tomatoes at 97 cents when it knew that everybody else was selling them at a dollar and that's what started the price war and that's why trading stamps are so different from what Safeway's price cuts were and that's why we say there's a perfectly valid distinction between how Safeway's practices should be treated under this law and how the trading stamps should be treated under this law and please bear in mind that trading stamps had been used in Oklahoma for 45 years and there's no evidence in this record at all that they ever provoked a price war in Oklahoma nor is there anything in this record to sustain Mr. Clark's statement that there was “a brisk trade war provoked by the trading stamps at the time this litigation began.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.182" offset="16724093">The price war that was provoked was provoked by Safeway's price cuts and not by the trading stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.448" offset="16745200">All was peaceful before the price cuts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.270" offset="16756485">Now, may I really try to emphasize what the question was -- that was presented in the answer to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.594" offset="16813746">Paragraph 9 which appears on page 56 of the record and this is a petition for the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.563" offset="16841644">The question raised had to do with the Fourteenth and the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.890" offset="16862960">I think the Fifth Amendment has -- something that just crept in there but what I'm trying to tell you is that when issue was joined, so far as due process and equal protection or any federal question is concerned, it was pitched solely on the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.358" offset="16940805">Then when the Safeway lost in the trial court and petition to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma as appears from page 4, paragraph 21 of the record, again, it was only the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment and no other federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.622" offset="17033906">Then when Safeway lost in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and petitioned for a rehearing the record shows at page 648 and 649, the assignments of -- of the petition in error again speaks only of the Fourteenth and the Fifth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.445" offset="17161174">Then when the Safeway Company came here in its notice of appeal which appears on pages 693, 694 and 695, there are four grounds or sub-grounds in paragraph III for appealing to this Court and in each case, the appeal is for violation of the due process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.033" offset="17307460">And finally, when you come to the jurisdictional statement, again it's only the Fourteenth Amendment which is said to present a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.342" offset="17360750">Now, in this Court, in the -- in the brief in this Court, Safeway now claims that there is, a question of the federal supremacy, presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="4337.693" offset="17454164">I suppose really now that I've reached this point that is perhaps carrying coals to Newcastle to argue the non-availability of a federal question not raised in the state court and not preserved in the notice of appeal and in the jurisdictional statement, but even at the risk of carrying some coals to Newcastle, I would suggest that in McGoldrick against Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U.S. 430, which I am embarrassed to say I did not cite in my brief contains the complete answer to the attempt to raise in this Court a question which was never presented nor litigated in the State Court having been present at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.095" offset="17691773">I can assure this Court that there wasn't a word of oral argument on that point nor was there a written word in any of the briefs and you will search in vain through the record to find that the federal supremacy question was ever raised at all and it seems to me that the reason why this Court should not attempt to pass upon a federal question not raised in the Court below is pretty obvious that the State Court should have its own opportunity to so construe its statute as to bring it within constitutional requirements before this Court should attempt itself to pass upon it and in the McGoldrick against the Compagnie Generale --</text>
