            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Eben, you may proceed.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_bradley_eben" startTime="7.836" stopTime="280.401">
            <label>Mr. Anthony Bradley Eben</label>
            <text syncTime="7.836" offset="134666">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.614" offset="153788">Shortly before the Court recessed, I had alluded to the fact that the state of the record, one of the first that went up on appeal, was that there had been a prior statement given by the witness Carlin, concerning the events to which he had testified upon the trial, and I submit, of course, at this point that on that state of the record, at that particular time in view of the fact that the Jencks case followed shortly thereafter, in the Court of Appeals, a reversal would have been required, probably with a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.423" offset="293073">Undoubtedly, the Government was aware of that particular circumstance because, as I also said a short time ago, about a year later, they filed this memorandum to which I have made reference and a -- an affidavit in support of the memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.378" offset="376874">That memorandum, among other things, established -- it believed the following, that Belavan and Pool, the Senate investigators, had had an interview with Carlin in March of 1955, some three years prior.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.936" offset="451166">That, according to Belavan, this was the only interview that he quote “recalls”.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.874" offset="486902">He then stated that, on information and belief, he did not believe that Mr. Pool had -- had any other interview with Carlin but that he did not know Pool's whereabouts at this particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.174" offset="544057">Of course, 3500, Title 18 U.S.C. 3500 had come down prior -- and had been passed by Congress prior to the time that this particular affidavit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.504" offset="597347">So, Mr. Belavan, in preparing his affidavit, then, said in the words of the statute that he had summarized generally what Carlin had told him during the course of this interview, that this was not signed or adopted by Mr. Carlin but that he had prepared it purely for Chief Counsel Kennedy of the Committee, before whom Carlin was subsequently, some six months after the signing of the statement or the giving of the statement, before which Committee he testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.426" offset="745096">He then said, also in the words of the statute, according to his affidavit, that the memoranda was not a substantially verbatim recital.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.392" offset="788982">So, I say this are the words of the statute adopted in the affidavit and, undoubtedly, with an eye on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.973" offset="815313">Of course, I point out to the Court immediately that these are merely conclusions of the witness or the affiant in this particular case as to what the memoranda showed.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.773" offset="870484">Now, when the Government filed that particular memoranda supported by this affidavit, a number of questions of fact, as we view it, arose in the Court of Appeals, one, there was certainly an issue as to whether or not there was a signed statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.384" offset="936939">And, according to Carlin, there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.947" offset="947179">Two, even if there had not been a signed statement had there been a statement which had been adopted or accepted in any fashion by Mr Carlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.577" offset="997648">And, thirdly, was it a substantially verbatim recital of what -- of an oral statement of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.443" offset="1025128">The Court of Appeals, this we are most critical, decided, one, that there was no other statement and it did that purely by reference to the ex parte affidavit of Belavan without any cross-examination or inquiry being permitted into the matter whatsoever, by petitioner or any of the other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.410" offset="1116975">It also decided that the statement had never been adopted in any fashion by Mr. Carlin and, I submit most respectfully to this Court that the only way that the court below could have reached that conclusion would be by a full and complete 100% reliance upon what Mr. Belavan said in his ex parte affidavit, again, without having it tested by cross-examination of anyone.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.358" offset="1424802">That's correct, Your Honor, although, I still believe that Judge Kaufman was wrong in requiring a foundation of inconsistency to be laid prior to the introduction of or the production of the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.239" offset="1476315">That seemed to be the rule in virtually every other Circuit, except the Second Circuit, at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.856" offset="1498781">Now, the third question which was before the Court was whether or not this was a substantially verbatim recital of the oral statement given by Carlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.513" offset="1533471">And, the Court decided that, since Mr. Belavan had so characterized it, it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.238" offset="1560325">But, it went on in this particular instance to say that it had examined the internal evidence, which I put in quotes, “Itself and that internal evidence tended to bare out the statement of Mr. Belavan that it was not a substantially verbatim recital.”</text>
            <text syncTime="385.514" offset="1645380">Now, we submit again, I say to the Court, most respectfully, that with these three questions of fact at large that it was most improper for the Court of Appeals to decide this case purely on the ex parte affidavits of Mr. Belavan.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.200" offset="1720195">And, it did decide it in this fashion, against petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.474" offset="1733256">It stated that, while it was true that under Jencks it was error for the trial court to deny the petitioners the Carlin statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.810" offset="1782575">Nevertheless, Congress had seen fit to pass, 18 U.S.C. 3500, sometimes referred to as the Jencks Act, and that had a very narrow definition as to what statements were, that a summa -- a general summary of what a witness had told a government agent was obviously not within the -- within the purview of the statute and, therefore, in the event of a new trial, it would not be open to the petitioners and, therefore, he affirmed the conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.492" offset="1997302">And, if I may touch on that for a moment, since you have raised it, sir, the -- my client, Mr. Lev's counsel at the time, was the gentleman who opened up the cross-examination as to Carlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.940" offset="2059160">He was the very first.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.914" offset="2066996">He was able to illicit from Carlin, and you keep in mind that this was at the very outset of the trial in which a large conspiracy had been charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.770" offset="2106493">He was able to illicit from Carlin that Lev was not at this particular meeting that he reported, that he knew nothing at all about Lev at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.198" offset="2148185">I think that, had petitioner's counsel at that particular moment urged the production of the document, that he would have had no standing whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.501" offset="2189354">But, subsequently, he was tied up by other evidence to Rubin who is largely implicated by this statement and, under the Court's instructions, the familiar, usual, basic instructions are always given in conspiracy cases, he was tied to Rubin.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.936" offset="2259153">And, Rubin was largely, very, very largely implicated in the statement of Carlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.040" offset="2291545">But, I say there was no point at that time in petitioner's then-counsel to make the objection.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.553" offset="2361553">Everyone seemed to be content to take Judge Kaufman's ruling at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.855" offset="2378794">And, if you ever get a chance to examine the trial record here, you will understand why, because the Judge is very short with counsel and had been short with them all the way during the trial and, although I was not in the trial, I've examined the record and it appears to me that counsel was somewhat intimidated, particularly, in view of the fact that the Court had already announced what his ruling would be on this type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.167" offset="2471999">No one again ever made any such objection and, of course, I point out to the Court that Jencks had not come down and there was some authority at the particular time with some courts, not the majority view but the minority view, that a foundation of inconsistency had to be laid before there could be any production even to the Court in the very first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.028" offset="2555486">In any event, the record makes clear that no one again made any objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.975" offset="2583280">As I said before, may it please the Court, the -- we regard this error as a most serious error and we think, apart form the question as to whether or not this was a substantially verbatim recital, that the denial of the cross-examination alone to show whether or not there was not another written statement or that this statement had not been adopted or signed was most serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.943" offset="2679097">I point out again to Your Honors that, in adopting or signing a statement, it is not necessary, really, that a person sign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.051" offset="2711594">He might conceivably be in a room when his statement is read to him and, if he remained silent under such circumstances, as a reasonable man would speak out, that might, in itself, be an acknowledgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.683" offset="2762062">Nobody was given the right, whatsoever, to cross-examine Belavan as to whether or not the events which had occurred three years before were, in fact, true.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.954" offset="2807202">And, I also point to the language of the Court in which it finds that this was a substantially -- it was not a substantially verbatim recital.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.639" offset="2841893">There is no positive language there whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.362" offset="2852864">The Court seem to, and that is the court below, seem to equivocate when it said that this internal evidence tends to bear this out, that this was not a substantially verbatim statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.734" offset="2902288">I think, had we been given the right to cross-examine, we might well have established that this was a statement which would have been producible under the Jencks statute, as well as under the Jencks Act itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1285.490" offset="5245367">As a matter of fact, the theory -- the theory of the -- the appellants in the Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit was to attack the -- the holding of the Court insofar as it held that this was not a substantially verbatim recital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.161" offset="5316002">Now, we come to that -- that -- we come to the question now as to whether or not -- whether this was a substantially verbatim recital or not, was it not admissible under 18 U.S.C. 3500 and, if it was not admissible under 18 -- under that particular statute, was it not admissible under Jencks?</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.414" offset="5413073">We have held -- we have argued here in our briefs that, and we support it by reference to the expressed language of the statute into the legislative history underlying the statute, that the procedure for producing documents, as outlined in the Jencks statute, is not exclusive at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.771" offset="5486425">Particularly, it appears from the Senate debates led by Senator O'Malley where they made very clear that they had in mind that if the rules of criminal procedure or any rule of court permitted the introduction of such statements or summaries, then they would be admitted pursuant to that rule or -- of court or to the rules of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.955" offset="5591228">And, I point out to the Court, and we argue it extensively in our brief, that if the procedure, as outlined by the Jencks statute, is not exclusive, then under this Court decision in Jencks, it's clearly admissible whether it's a summary or whether it's hearsay, no matter what it is, if it reflects upon the events related by the witness at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.484" offset="5685269">I think, when this Court announced two rules of relevancy in Jencks, it was making that most clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.318" offset="5712645">As Your Honors will recall, you said that there is a rule of relevancy which governs production and then, subsequently, after the particular document is produced for the examination of the defense, then, the Court will rule upon relevancy form the standpoint of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.664" offset="5782026">Quite obviously, Your Honors would not have gone to the trouble of making that distinction if you had not had in mind, in the very first instance, that a non-admissible statement or report of a Government witness to a government agent might be admissible or might be producible in the very first instance without ever being admitted into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.969" offset="5867290">Otherwise, there'll be no reason for you to make the distinction, as I just pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.787" offset="5886516">So that, I say that, under Jencks, and we argue this, as I say, extensively that, under Jencks, at least from the standpoint of production, any summary by a government agent of what a witness told him is admissible or producible to the defendant in the first instance for such use, as this Court said, “on cross-examinations may further his defense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.711" offset="5986200">The Government's contention as of the statute and Jencks, both are based upon the same rationale that the only thing that is producible is a matter which might ultimately be admitted for impeaching purposes in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.094" offset="6039698">And, we say that, in the face of the language of this Court, that that cannot be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.184" offset="6056103">If so, there would be no reason for Jenks, the rule would be much the same as it was prior to Jencks, and there'd be no reason for 18 U.S.C. 3500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.359" offset="6092779">Now, we contend that a summary of what a witness told a government agent may be most useful to establish all of the things that this Court laid down as test of inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.869" offset="6150875">Not only flat contradiction, as you will recall, but omissions, order of statement, difference in contrast, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.907" offset="6187029">Nobody on the petitioner's side proposes that such a document could ever be used for impeachment purposes and, following the rule of this Court, there is no question that once a witness had --</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.697" offset="7526170">Well, may I continue with the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.248" offset="7544351">One of the contentions that we wish to submit is this, that the entire picture of the course of the trial must be taken to consideration as to the relevance of this particular incident as to Carlin's statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.472" offset="7601298">There were six defendants on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.374" offset="7612897">Each represented by their own counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.837" offset="7626689">As a result, we had agreed with the Government and with Justice Kaufman that an objection taken by one would be an objection covering all, unless one of the attorneys chose to take some other course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.908" offset="7691055">This was done with the hope that it would expedite the trial, and I respectfully call to Your Honor's attention that this trial took six weeks to the day, from the date that the jury was poke -- picked, rather, to the date that the jury came back with a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.011" offset="7751450">And, it was hoped that, by following this particular course of conduct, we could expedite the trail rather than have the trial prolonged even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.527" offset="7793455">Therefore, when the counsel went into cross-examination, we were seated at the counsel table in the same order in which the defendants were named in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.666" offset="7846013">Consequently, Lev, having appeared as number one defendant in the indictment, Lev's counsel sat as the first attorney to cross-examine the witness, and so on down the line, And, it was intended that, by following this orderly procedure, that there wouldn't be a repetition of having each attorney come into the same line of cross-examination if that line of cross-examination had already been covered by the attorney who had cross-examined just before he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.024" offset="7971506">Now, it is on that basis that when Carlin testified, and he was one of the first, in fact, probably the first material witness that was called to the stand, after having submitted various exhibits in evidence that were very lengthy and so forth, when he was called to the stand, the testimony that he presented was very material to the issues in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.250" offset="8076413">First of all, he was an accountant and he was not one of the parties involved in the partiular transactions that were later disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.011" offset="8115388">Now, when Carlin testified, he set the groundwork for what purported to be a conspiracy but, at the time of the -- rather, the period of time that he described did not affect the defendant Lev, did not affect the defendant Wool, whom I represented, because both Lev and Wool came into the picture in this Quartermaster setup which later became, commonly referred to as ASTAPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.008" offset="8235447">Approximately, a year later or some nine months later, in any event, any description of the events that took place in Carlin's testimony, preceded by some nine months where he discussed what was going on amongst Rubin and the partners, namely, Levy and Ades.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.056" offset="8323636">So that, when the point came up for cross-examination, there was nothing for us to cross-examine, when I say us, I mean counsel for Lev and counsel for Wool, because there was no mention of him nor would there be any materiality in cross-examining him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.978" offset="8387271">But, in view of the fact that the Court had ruled that we could not examine any document until we can prove to the satisfaction of the Court that there was something contradictory between the testimony given by the witness on the witness stand and that which he had given in some previous document and, since we had already agreed on our procedures as to objections and exceptions taken and so forth, it then became a futility for us to come with each witness to make the same request again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.949" offset="8531153">In fact, it even served to hurt us a little bit deeper than that because, when Carlin testified that he had in fact signed such a statement or be it that he believed he had singed such a statement and then we were denied the statement, certainly, the jury had a right to assume from that that he had, in fact, adopted such a statement and that, if the statement had been produced, it would have borne out exactly what he had testified at the time of the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2265.399" offset="9164988">It was I who made the objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.032" offset="9175542">It was I who asked Carlin to produce the statement, and I would like to answer Justice Frankfurter very clearly that I don't think there was any skulduggeryon the part of the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.732" offset="9230294">I have the utmost respect from Mr. Arthur Christy who tried this case, a very, very fine able young man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.253" offset="9256417">What happened was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.886" offset="9266866">They -- I believe Mr. Christy said to me, call me, or sent me a copy of the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.904" offset="9294973">It was virtually contemporaneous with the brief, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, so that, we did have the opportunity, if we wanted to, to make an application of some description to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.514" offset="9341471">However, in view of the condition of the record, I saw no reason for doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.998" offset="9363414">I had asked this witness Carlin whether or not he had been interviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.739" offset="9382327">I had asked him whether he had given a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.591" offset="9393716">He said “I believe I have.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.497" offset="9401344">Now, there's one aspect of it that I think is most important at this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.564" offset="9421615">When I made that request, the first thing that the District Attorney said was that no foundation has been laid, and then, the Court, no foundation was laid even to ask the question whether he had given a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.720" offset="9486294">Then, that was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.826" offset="9490683">Then, after that, when I asked for the statement, the District Attorney opposed on the ground that I had made -- laid no foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.431" offset="9517119">Now, I urge the Court to consider the Gordon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.688" offset="9538121">I considered, at that time, myself that the rule in the Second Circuit was entirely erroneous and I couldn't understand why statements such as might be in the possession of the Government which were not state secrets, I know of no reason why we couldn't have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.250" offset="9600397">To me, it seemed co --incompatible with justice that the Department of Justice, the District Attorney can hold papers which you -- from you but you can't get them from him, so that, it was my sincere urging at that time that I be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.204" offset="9668211">And, I quoted the Gordon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.378" offset="9680854">Well, Judge Kaufman said not only would he give it to me, ut he wouldn't even look at the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.132" offset="9711888">He said “now, I would like to know how I could possibly know whether there was an inconsistency in a statement that he wouldn't even look at himself or let me see.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.157" offset="9752012">All this time, the District Attorney was continualing -- continually arguing as if there was such a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.487" offset="9785344">I was clearly let off my guard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.208" offset="9836231">I would have made that objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.962" offset="9843231">I had discussed it with my -- with my co-counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.817" offset="9854621">I had discussed it with Mr. Lev's counsel, with Mr. Treiman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.208" offset="9868204">I had intended to get every statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.214" offset="9876250">I knew that there were many statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.550" offset="9885550">This case had started with the McClellan Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.003" offset="9895372">There was hardly a law enforcement bureau that wasn't in this, and I was very, very, very anxious to get those statements and I believe that I was deprived of those statements by things which were not exactly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.361" offset="9956812">Once again, I say no real active intention on the part of the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.429" offset="9977083">If Your Honor please, when I argued, and I went back again to Judge Kaufman, I argue the proposition with him again and he delivered himself of that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.625" offset="10017834">So that, I felt that if were to continually assert the proposition that I want this statement, I have a great respect for the judge who is sitting in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.459" offset="10065168">As a defense lawyer, I do not want to seem disrespectful in any way and I don't think it helps the cause of your client by doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.585" offset="10097664">So, then, I came to the conclusion that I would have to drop that, although I felt that Judge Kaufman was absolutely wrong about his contention.</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.135" offset="10223888">I think, I can assist Your Honors greatly by giving you the facts as I know them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2537.367" offset="10252831">I took more part in this trial than anyone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2542.902" offset="10274983">I did the whole job there and I think that I know the facts as well as anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.764" offset="10290448">What actually happen in this case was, you had a little company called “Bonita” which was in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.353" offset="10316779">Bonita had two partners, Levy and Ades.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.986" offset="10327333">Levy and Ades came from the Middle East and they had been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.427" offset="10341125">Ades had been from Brooklyn and he went to Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.518" offset="10353455">So, they had this little embroidery business and they were going nowhere, and they met Marvin Rubin, another young fellow from Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.744" offset="10386369">And, Marvin Rubin then said the he could get them business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.716" offset="10398281">He have had some experience in procurement matters, so that they got together and they started to try to do something with this enterprise in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.598" offset="10445720">Now, the only thing that distinguished the enterprise in Puerto Rico was, in Puerto Rico, you got a low-wage scale and the people down there can handle the needle business pretty well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.810" offset="10482604">So, that was all there was to that enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.754" offset="10490337">It was just a little kitchen table enterprise that didn't amount to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.405" offset="10509040">And, so, Rubin went in and Rubin got contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.463" offset="10529207">Now, I'm giving you these facts to show you that characterization, such as the Solicitor General makes to the effect of overwhelming testimony, that Carlin was only secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.352" offset="10572779">This, if Your Honors please, is far from the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.027" offset="10583437">These were very close questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.392" offset="10592946">As witness to the fact that one defendant was acqui -- acquitted, as witness to the fact that the jury was out for an extended period of time going into its second day, as witness to the fact they came back 14 times for instructions, as witness to the fact they asked that the cross-examination of Carlin be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.480" offset="10669328">So that, Carlin's testimony was not secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.902" offset="10683016">It was very critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.609" offset="10689808">It was the foundation stone of their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.194" offset="10700152">Now, if Your Honors pleas, there were only three witnesses for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.895" offset="10714990">Sure, there were 27, but there were only 3 real witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.296" offset="10728573">There was Levy, the former partner of Ades, the man who was dissatisfied because he wasn't taken on the white hat contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.576" offset="10761697">There was Addison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.614" offset="10765876">There was Porreca, the Chief Inspector, and there was Carlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.520" offset="10789491">Carlin was the -- one of the main stones of this entire case and it cannot be stated by the Solicitor General or any one else that his testimony was secondary, that it was not anything that had a bearing on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.803" offset="10858559">The things that they did, naturally, they try to do everything they possibly could with the inspection service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.767" offset="10886457">They try to get all the favors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.937" offset="10895130">They could, with all these contractors, operate this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.218" offset="10908296">They naturally didn't go in and insult the inspectors, so that, there came a time that a great white hat procurement was coming up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.168" offset="10948002">This was a very big contract and this, of course, could be manufactured in Puerto Rico much more cheaply than any where else in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.286" offset="10980498">By this time, Mr. Rubin, the able, eager promoter, Mr. Rubin was a promoter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.500" offset="11013413">He decided at that point that if he could -- he had met Harry Lev.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.991" offset="11027310">Harry Lev was a big tycoon of hat manufacturing in Chicago and he could get Harry Lev to take that contract, there c -- they could make a lot of money down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.461" offset="11061164">Well, all this happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.699" offset="11066180">Harry Lev took the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.334" offset="11072658">They built a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.360" offset="11076838">Harry Lev was a very great manufacturer of hats, and Harry Lev had so -- save the Government, I would say, millions of dollars over the years with his methods of manufacturing hats.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.619" offset="11121873">There was no real depriving of the Government of any money here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.352" offset="11136815">This case was built up on the basis of the McClellan hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.122" offset="11151862">This was the very first big publicity that that Committee had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.281" offset="11172446">Out came the Lev case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.487" offset="11177357">Mr. Lev was an object of quite a lot of interest due to his personal characteristics and, as result of that, this case came to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.239" offset="11216332">And, so then, they started reaching out to get this piece of evidence and that piece of evidence and put a twist on one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.079" offset="11247679">And, I'd like the Court here, Court's attention to one particular thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.243" offset="11260322">There was a contract called the Wollman contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.095" offset="11271711">They stated why, due to improprieties, Mr. Rubin had caused the Wollman contract to be canceled and he took it over.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.810" offset="11374634">The Solicitor General's brief, when you see the Solicitor General's brief, you'll see it largely argues on the overwhelming proof and on the harmless error, and I -- the only reason that I saw fit to inject these facts is because of the fact that those statements have a name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.245" offset="11440358">However, I say to Your Honors, in conclusion, that I agree with you that it probably is something that is not really an issue under the order that this Court has made, but I say that there was no -- that it could never be cured under harmless error statute, what transpired here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.061" offset="11519666">In this very close case, as a result of the decision of the district court and not giving me access to the -- to the statements of the Government witnesses, which surely were in existence, if the Court please, there can be no doubt that there were many, many statements in existence with respect to all of the Government witnesses, particularly, the three critical Government witnesses Porreca, Levy, and Carlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.319" offset="11636694">So that, I assure the Court that, from the standpoint of harmless error, I feel that even though I submit that harmless error would not overcome the doctrine of the Jencks case, I say that it isn't here for this Court to consider because this is not an incident where harmless error could ever result in a decision by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.863" offset="13770794">I guess that's my answer to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.146" offset="13779989">So that, when the Court of Appeals affirmed and said that, because of the supervening statute and because of the affidavit, I conclude my argument by stating that that, once again, deprived me of a very, very, very, valid right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.067" offset="13859610">I wish to amplify that to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.249" offset="13872358">When I was informed -- when I was informed by the witness that he believes he had signed a statement, and when the District Attorney led me further into the morass of that belief that there was such a statement, and I then went -- had the colloquy with Judge Kaufman and argued the proposition, I believe, at that point, that I had been given a decision, a clear-cut decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.393" offset="13992939">I -- I considered that the question on the issue of whether or not I was entitled to that paper, to that statement, had clearly been decided and there was not point to my repeating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.620" offset="14037870">But, I found that, through the District Attorney having led me into this mistake, that, of course, I didn't have a clear-cut decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.713" offset="14070262">But then, the Court of Appeals took the affidavit and considered the statement against me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.587" offset="14097742">I was defeated in both places by what I considered to be completely extrajudicial actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.473" offset="14125223">I do not think the Court of Appeals has any power to take such an affidavit, particularly in the view of the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.049" offset="14159600">And, in conclusion, I can only say that it was a very, very close issue of fact in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.953" offset="14187186">It was r -- extremely close and that, if I had been able to get the statements, if Judge Kaufman had even expounded the law, as the Second Circuit understood it at the time, I think that it would have made a very big difference in the result of this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.726" offset="14254268">If he had given me the understatements, it's my belief that these witnesses, the three main witnesses, I want the Court to consider who they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.761" offset="14290422">One was an accomplice, Levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.515" offset="14297422">He was unindicted, clearly an accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.861" offset="14306826">The other was Porreca, who said he took a bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.492" offset="14321351">The only other witness that the Government submitted that really bore on the critical issue was the witness Carlin, and the witness Carlin was the very first witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.098" offset="14363773">He was a certified public accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.551" offset="14373595">He was a witness who was, well, he was not an accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.074" offset="14387702">He couldn't be held to be guilty of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.933" offset="14399091">And, when the jury came back and asked for his cross-examination to be read to them again, it shows the critical nature of his testimony, and I endorsed what Mr. Treiman had said with respect to the objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.882" offset="14446947">Judge Kaufman really streamlined this trial by stipulations and pretrial conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.621" offset="14469831">It was a very long trial, and we did agree to do these rather unusual things in the line of the stipulations and limiting objections, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.929" offset="14511104">Well I might also add, and I -- it's rather with some hesitation that I say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.726" offset="14538271">I say that I do not think that the record will show that these defendants received a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.091" offset="14563767">I believe, and I stated in my brief in the circuit Court of Appeals, that it was, to me, obvious throughout, at least I felt that way, possibly defense counsel always feel that way but, I felt that the Court was really not giving me the fair trial I think I was entitled to and was reaching out for the conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3661.922" offset="14751013">Because the Court has allotted a greater period of time to this case than to the succeeding cases, I shall try to lay the groundwork for all the cases by discussion of the so-called Jencks Act, 18 USC 3500, as well as our understanding of the Jencks decision, as well as to try the deal with this particular case which is now before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3769.723" offset="15182242">I don't know what the status in the Court of Appeals is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.545" offset="15193527">Now, the next case, the Valyermo case, is a case which was tried after the Jencks decision and after the Jencks statute, and it involves, again, a claim that what was denied production was a summary of a part of the Government witness' testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.572" offset="15261654">There was also a claim in that case that if the -- if the refusal of the production of the document was error, it was harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.131" offset="15295927">The third case, the Rosenberg case that comes from the Third Circuit is also a post-Jencks Act and post-Jencks decision case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.364" offset="15328841">It was tried under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.829" offset="15338663">In our view, and Ms. Rosenberg for the Government will explain it further, the documents which are involved in that case are wholly peripheral because the trial judge said that he went beyond the statute to even give summaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.904" offset="15386937">So that, in our view, what is involved there are wholly peripheral documents from the files of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.641" offset="15409925">And, that case does involve the F.B.I., the Palermo case which is an income tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.118" offset="15431868">The Palermo case would be the next succeeding case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.212" offset="15440227">It involves the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.755" offset="15450363">Then, the third and fourth cases, the Pittsburgh Plate Glass case and the Galax case, involved grand jury testimony which is all to produce grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.985" offset="15491323">As to which, the Jencks Act is tangentially relevant but not directly on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.414" offset="15513057">And, the last of these cases, the Scales case which, of course, involves wholly different and very important issues, also has in it a question arising under the Jenks Act because the retrial of Scales was under the g -- was after the Jencks Act and, therefore, under the Jencks Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.249" offset="15576377">And, it involves the question of the excision from documents which were produced to the defendant and his counsel, parts of the documents which were thought by the Government and trial court and the Court of Appeals to be irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.931" offset="15627055">With that summary statement of the -- of these group of cases, I come now to this case and I think it would be very, very helpful if I set forth before the Court, a little more directly than has been done, the type of facts that there were in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.328" offset="15700720">Now, of course, I'm not going to argue the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.013" offset="15711378">That is not before the Court, but it has a very, very direct bearing on the impact of the denial of this document relating to Carlin on the three defendants in this case to know exactly what this case was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.978" offset="15767280">As has been pointed out, quite fairly, this is a case involving a fraud in procurement involving the Quartermaster Corps in -- the so-called Quartermaster Corps Department in New York ,in 16th Street in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.453" offset="15817226">It involves two separate types of procurement, and this is terribly important because the petitioner Lev is involved only in the second one of these procurements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.127" offset="15855888">As to which, as I shall point out in detail, Carlin testified nothing at all, and as to which Judge Kaufman, many times, directed the jury not to consider any testimony as to petitioner Lev.</text>

            <text syncTime="3959.030" offset="15939480">That is exactly right, Mr Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.663" offset="15950033">Now, the two types of procurement that were involved was, first, a series of three contracts for garrison caps, these little caps that soldiers and airmen wear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.997" offset="15999352">That was -- those contracts were left to the Bonita Company, the Bonita Originals Company, as to which, Carlin -- for whom Carlin was the accountant for a period of about nine months in the beginning of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.900" offset="16050970">His testimony was solely as to the B -- to the Bonita contacts and contracts with the Quartermaster Corps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.020" offset="16087437">He -- he did not mention the word or the name of Lev.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.459" offset="16101230">He said that he had no knowledge whatsoever of the white hat procurement, which is the second one that I'm about to come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.814" offset="16126621">As to which, Lev was the dominant factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.589" offset="16137697">Now, the second procurement was the white hat procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.264" offset="16148459">They were white sailor hats. It was a procurement of 7 million white sailor hats, which -- for which, Lev and his companies had the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.878" offset="16190882">Now, that did not come about until almost a year after the garrison cap contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.058" offset="16219617">It started about the beginning of 1953 which was about a year later, long after Carlin, the witness in controversy, had left the entire transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.989" offset="16263293">He had left the Bonita Company and had nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.702" offset="16278131">Now, it is also, as I stress because it is terribly important that we believe at least as to petitioner Lev, that throughout the trial -- throughout the trial, Judge Kaufman made it absolutely clear that all the testimony relating to the Bonita Company, that is, the garrison cap contracts, was not to be considered as against petitioner Lev because he was not involved in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.451" offset="16377187">And, throughout his charge to the jury, he made it equally clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.929" offset="16391084">In fact, when the jury came back and asked some questions which, to his mind, indicated that there might be some doubt in their mind as to that, he repeated again that none of the Bonita testimony was to be considered as to Harry Lev.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.449" offset="16445210">And, I repeat again that the testimony of the witness Carlin was wholly and solely relating to the Bonita contracts, the garrison cap contracts, and had no relation whatsoever to the white hat procurement, the sailor hat procurement with which Harry Lev was related.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.225" offset="16508322">Now, it has been indicated, but I think not brought out clearly for Your Honors, that this was a long trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.981" offset="16539251">There are 3,600 pages of testimony and the entire transcript to the record which is on file in this Court is over 4,000 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.603" offset="16581778">There were 27 Government witnesses and a number of defendant witnesses, including testimony by the defendant Rubin who is a petitioner here and other defendants who are not in this Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.060" offset="16639561">I would stress, too, because it's important, at least on our argument upon this area, that there was an extraordinary amount of testimony as to bribes and doing of pecuniary favors by the defendants in these cases before the Quartermaster Corps.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.325" offset="16704658">The witness Carlin was, as we say in our brief, and I shall try if I have time to point it out, a wholly secondary witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.519" offset="16733497">The witness Levy who was involved in the Bonita conspiracy and also had knowledge of the white hat conspiracy was a very detailed witness as to all the elements of the -- both aspects of the conspiracy, and he detailed the large number of bribes and favors which were done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.755" offset="16814373">There were -- in addition to the witness Levy, there were government officials who had been themselves participants in this entire conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.426" offset="16849063">There was not on the full record the Chief Inspector who did favors for these people as a result of a bribe of $1000 by Harry Lev and other moneys by the and -- by the other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.057" offset="16899636">But, there were inspectors who testified, as well, of what they did in this relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.438" offset="16925132">I say this because I want to make it clear that, in the Government's view, this -- the testimony of Carlin was very secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.922" offset="16955016">He was one of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.080" offset="16959718">He was actually the second witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.715" offset="16966196">But, as the trial progressed, the weight of the testimony was overwhelming and I think I should say right now, and I'll try to come back to it, that we think this is a case in which there is perfectly well applicable the language which the Court used a few terms ago in the Lochlet case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.834" offset="17034742">This is a record that barely shrieks of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.403" offset="17053027">There was also testimony, and this is important, by third parties, in addition to Carlin, the bookkeeper in the establishment of the Bonita Company who corroborated much of what Carlin said, other people who were wholly unconnected with the conspiracy who corroborated what was done and, finally, there were admissions by the defendants of payments which, of course, they thought were not bribes but mere personal favors or for other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.166" offset="17172041">But, there were admissions by the defendant of clear payments to the government officials involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.761" offset="17198373">Now, with this background, I come to make a summary statement, first, of what I hope to present to the Court in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.454" offset="17245184">I think I may have made it clear that, in our view, the denial of the production of this document relating to Carlin has -- had not relation whatsoever to the petitioner Lev and, therefore, regardless of what might be done as to the other petitioners, the petitioner Lev's conviction cannot be reversed or any action taken with relation to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5148.117" offset="20695855">Well, any way, that is the view of the Jencks decision which was taken by the Department of Justice, by a number of federal courts though, as I shall say, not by all, and by the members of Congress when the bill came before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.633" offset="20757922">After the Jencks decision, there were, as the Court is aware, a number of lower court decisions which, in the view of the department and, subsequently, came to be the view of Congress, extended the Jencks decision or found implications in the Jencks decision which, in our view, where not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.876" offset="20826885">Extended it to pretrial matters, extended it to requiring the production on entire Government files regardless of the relevancy of the materials, even extended to quashing post c -- after conviction, quashing convictions even though no demand for production had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.620" offset="20897834">As a result of this cropping up of lower court cases, suggestion was made by the Department of Justice to the Congress that a bill should be enacted which would incorporate the rule of the Jencks case, as we understood it, and would also set the confines of the so-called Jencks doctrine so that there would be, in the future, no reason for doubt as to what types of production of documents relating to Government witnesses should be produced in federal criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.855" offset="21038791">I think that it may help if I say that there were four purposes of the statute, which are revealed not only by the presentation by the Department of Justice, which was the initial moving factor, but which are revealed by the entire legislative history of the committee reports and the debates on the Floor of both Houses of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.010" offset="21123427">And, the first of those purposes was to accept the Jencks decision as it was understood, that is, authenticated documents of the witnesses were to be produced by the Government for impeachment purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="5609.399" offset="22540936">And, these are -- this is a matter of common knowledge which was known to Congress, too, that there are many types of summaries or memoranda of conferences or interviews which contain omissions in which the interviewer is interested in one thing and fails to include qualifications or important matters which the interviewee, the perspective or potential witness, thinks are important.</text>

            <text syncTime="5659.780" offset="22742497">you have to separate out that part of the statement which is the interviewer's addition and that part of it which is the true statement of the interviewee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.789" offset="22778546">And, the judgment that Congress made was that this can't properly be done unless you have the kind of statements which are included in subsection (e) of the Jencks Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.275" offset="22820446">And, of course, our position is that that's a reasonable position which Congress had the right to adopt on the basis of the prior law in this field and on the basis of the common knowledge and experience which Congress, along with all the rest of us, has.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.311" offset="22896619">But, before I come to that, I'd like to make sure that Your Honors understand that that is what Congress did because there has been some claim that Congress did not do what I said, that it did not limit the Jencks Act to authenticated documents or authenticated statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5715.603" offset="22965791">And, that these words do not mean what they appear on their surface to mean.</text>

            <text syncTime="6077.996" offset="24415378">So, they had to have the broadest type of definition of the word “statements or report” or they wouldn't succeed in fulfilling that purpose which they had, so that they could not use a limited definition of the word “statement” with relation to (a) as they do later on when they come to what's to be produced at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6097.266" offset="24492387">They wanted it to provide that all types of statements should not be produced prior to trial, all types authenticated, unauthenticated, summaries, competent, whatever type.</text>
            <text syncTime="6108.511" offset="24537422">And, we think that's the clear explanation of why Congress did what it did in limiting the definition of statement to the post-tri -- or the midst of trial provisions of the Jencks Act.</text>
